Nestor A Espenilla, Jr: Mindfulness and vigilanceKeynote speech by Mr Nestor A Espenilla, Jr, Governor of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP, the central bank of the Philippines), at the Money Market Association of the Philippines, Inc. (MART) MART First General Assembly, Makati City, 22 March 2018.*   *   *Good evening everyone.  I thank the officers and members of the Money Market Association ofthe Philippines, Inc. (MART) led by Mr. Christopher Salazar for the invitation to speak today aboutthe current operating environment, the BSP’s monetary policy actions ... our direction ... and ourmindful approach in the implementation of monetary, prudential and financial reforms.Mindfulness.  The concept of “mindfulness” has gained so much popularity.  It is a buzz wordthat frequently crops up in online articles, magazines, newspapers, TV programs, podcasts andconversations. But what does it mean?  Does “mindfulness” have application in Central Bankingand monetary policy formulation?  I believe so.“Mindfulness” is not a new idea.   The concept is core to Buddhism, traced as far back as thefifth century BC.  A widely used definition is by Dr. Jon Kabat-Zinn of the University ofMassachusetts Medical School.  He defines mindfulness as “paying attention in a particular way:on purpose, in the present moment and non-judgmentally.” What is monetary policy’s “present moment”?Monetary policy stanceJust this afternoon, in our latest monetary policy assessment, the BSP maintained its key policyrate steady at 3.0 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility. Corresponding rates on overnight and deposit facilities were also kept unchanged.Our decision is based on our assessment that while recent inflation outturns show elevated pathin 2018, latest baseline forecasts continue to show inflation remaining within the target in 2018and moderating further in 2019.  We also considered that prospects for domestic activitycontinue to be firm on the back of robust domestic demand, strong growth in credit and liquidity,and sustained recovery in global economic growth.As such, monetary policy action is not warranted at this time, at this present moment.VigilanceTsong-kha-pa, a famous Teacher of Tibetan-Buddhism, wrote in his Great Treatise on theStages of Path to Enlightenment, that mindfulness is a non-distracted focal attention on thepresent.  Vigilance, on the other hand, is the close monitoring of that very awareness.Practicing vigilance, we at the BSP, note that inflation expectations have started to rise and willtherefore need to be closely monitored in the coming months.  Remaining watchful, weacknowledge that on balance, risks to the inflation outlook remain weighted toward the upside. With circumspection, we observe that there are potential second round price pressuresemanating from pending petitions for adjustments in minimum wages and transportation fares. Nevertheless, non-monetary measures, such as targeted subsidies, are expected to mitigatethese inflationary impulses.  Proposed tariffication reforms in the rice industry could alsopositively surprise and help significantly temper price pressures especially in 2019.Looking ahead, we stay alert to any signs of second-round effects and inflation becoming1 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
broader based.  We stand firm in our intent to take immediate and appropriate measures toensure that the monetary policy stance supports our price and financial stability objectives. Economic growth remains solid enough to absorb some policy tightening if warranted.  Further,we observe that market mechanisms are working well to enable the economy to automaticallyadjust to fluid conditions efficiently and avoid serious imbalances, as well as overheating risks.Our decisions on the monetary policy stance will continue to be data-dependent.  Focus will beon domestic conditions while taking into account external developments only to the extent thatthese impact the domestic inflation outlook and financial conditions.Need for vigilance in face of risksWhy is vigilance important? English writer J.A. Baker, in his work, “The Peregrine: The Hill ofSummer Diaries” wrote that, “Binoculars, and a hawk-like vigilance, reduce the disadvantage ofmyopic human vision.”We cannot afford myopia. We must always be mindful of the risks all around us.World economic activity finally started to gather speed after years of subpar growth following theGlobal Financial Crisis.  The IMF revised its global growth forecasts for 2018 and 2019 to 3.9percent, 20 basis points higher than the previous forecast.At the heart of external risks is the US Federal Reserve’s normalization of its monetary policy.Further, other major central banks are also considering exit from expansionary monetary policy. Geopolitical tensions and rising protectionist sentiments further complicate the global operatingenvironment.Zen in the resent: strength of the economyThe existence of risks is not a negative thing.  Risks will always be present.   The good news isthat the present reality imbibes confidence in us.The Philippine economy is strong.  We continue to deliver gains amidst monetary policydivergence and uncertainty. Our macroeconomic fundamentals are robust and sound.  Further,our financial system is more sophisticated, disciplined, and resilient. Real GDP has registered positive growth for 76 consecutive quarters, covering a span of 19years since 1999! In 2017, GDP grew by 6.7 percent, making the Philippines one of Asia’sfastest and most consistently growing economies.This growth performance is in line with the economy’s potential output, currently estimated ataround 6.0-7.0 percent. The improvement in potential output reflects declining incrementalcapital-output ratio, rising total factor productivity, and improving workforce capacity.  As we pourin more investments in physical infrastructure under Build, Build, Build, and more softinvestments in our young population to provide better health, high quality education, and skillsdevelopment, we can expect further accelerated growth in potential output.  These investmentsare sustainable because they are supported by a prudent fiscal position characterized by lowerNational Government debt-to-GDP ratio of around 42 percent and additional revenues to begenerated from the recent tax reform (TRAIN). There is thus strong basis for asserting that the economy can sustain its growth momentum.Likewise, higher output capacity should allay concerns of potential overheating.The country’s external position is manageable despite global headwinds.  The country’s overallbalance of payments (BOP) for the year 2017 posted a deficit of US$863 million. This is just0.3% of GDP.  The underlying widening of the trade-in-goods gap stems from rising imports of 2 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
goods that support domestic capital formation and production.  This development is consistentwith the country’s growth narrative. One should expect that the economy’s expansion will beaccompanied by stronger demand for imports. Over time, investment led economic activities willsupport needed infrastructure development, raise domestic competitiveness, increase goodsexports, and alleviate the trade gap.The sustained resilience of foreign direct investments, overseas Filipino (OF) remittances, andbusiness process outsourcing (BPO) receipts provide additional buffers to the domesticeconomy. External debt metrics have also improved as reflected in the continued decline in theexternal debt-to-GDP ratio to around 23 percent.  Gross international reserves (GIR) of US$80.6billion as of end-February 2018 provide ample manoeuvring room to manage shocks.The Philippines’ robust economic growth has been accompanied by manageable inflation.  Wehave established since 2009 a solid track record of meeting our inflation targets.Headline inflation’s year-to-date average rose to 3.7 percent (using the 2012 series) in 2018. This is at the high end of the target range of 3.0 percent ± 1.0 percentage point in 2018. But weexpect it to revert to the target midpoint in 2019.The Philippine banking system remains safe and sound, with robust performance and sustainedexpansion in credit.  This is complemented by improved asset quality, firm liquidity position, andstrong capitalization.The road to a resilient banking sector has not been easy.  Systematic structural reforms wereimplemented to get the financial system to where it is now.  We have seen significant progress inthe adoption of Basel III reforms, particularly in the areas of capital, leverage, liquidity andregulation of systemically important banks. We have rolled out a four-phased program for liquidity risk management. We continue to upgradeour corporate governance and risk management standards and remain committed to pursueprudential reforms amid changing market conditions and increasing sophistication of financialservices.  Today, our comprehensive risk-based supervision approach ensures that our banks operate in asafe and sound manner. We use a range of tools and techniques in deploying our supervisoryresources on a proportionate basis, including deployment of calibrated enforcement actions. Indeed, our financial system demonstrates discipline and sophistication.  It operates in aregulatory environment that promotes innovation.  At the same time, it provides mechanisms tocorrect misbehaviour.  This, together with strong economic foundation, affords us moreconfidence to forge ahead with bold market-oriented reforms and liberalization efforts.  This willallow financial institutions to seize more opportunities to support our growing economy; to bemore innovative, competitive and flexible and to adjust rapidly to the needs of their customers.We recognize that transformative reforms are needed to gear up the financial system to be moreefficient and responsive to the changing economic landscape.Taking the next (confident) steps – expanding policy toolkit and bold financial reformsAs challenges evolve globally and domestically, the BSP continues to expand its policy toolkit,including enhancing price discovery and self-correcting mechanisms. As early as 2016, we have committed to a more progressive and market-oriented framework withthe operational shift in our monetary operations to the interest rate corridor (IRC) system. Since then, we have seen the success of the IRC as an effective liquidity management tool.  Thisis evident in the substantial migration of placements in the overnight deposit facility (ODF) to the 3 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
Term Deposit Auction Facility (TDF).  It has allowed us to provide more effective guidance toshort-term market interest rates by promoting healthy price discovery as the BSP calibratesauction volumes.Indeed, for the past months, market rates have seen a stronger anchoring to the BSP’s policyrate. Universal/commercial banks’ time deposit and short term interest rates have trendedupwards, aligning with BSP’s IRC. The effective implementation of the IRC now provides the BSP sufficient flexibility to increasereliance on market-based instruments for liquidity management. As a result, we were able to initiate another major financial market reform:  the phased andgradual reduction of the reserve requirement ratio (RRR), to allow for more efficient absorptionand mobilization of liquidity, starting with a one percentage point reduction effective last March 2,2018. As with the shift to the IRC system, the phased reduction in reserve requirements is anoperational adjustment and will not materially affect prevailing monetary policy settings.  Excessliquidity released to the market will be re-absorbed through offsetting adjustments in our openmarket operations (OMO) that are informed by our updated liquidity forecasts.Initial evidence based on the last three TDF auctions since the first RRR cut took effect areencouraging and indicative of the potency of the IRC facilities for liquidity absorption. We candefinitely do more as the system continues to mature.Ultimately, the BSP has many options to maintain firm monetary control.  Shifts in monetarypolicy stance will continue to be signalled through changes in the policy rate. But we can alsoadjust monetary conditions without necessarily changing the policy rate, by adjusting auctionvolumes to move the market-determined TDF rates.A flexible exchange rate is another integral part of our policy toolkit to maintain monetary stabilityand to ensure the sustainability of the balance of payments.  We do not target an exchange ratelevel but we carefully watch out for excessive volatility that can disrupt the economy.  Our ideal isa market-determined exchange rate that offers no persistent one-way bets to anyone.Mindful of the potential build-up of systemic vulnerabilities, we have also deployed and continue todevelop various macroprudential measures.  Currently, we have exposure drafts on thecountercyclical capital buffer, the debt-to-earnings borrowers test (DEBT) that is akin to theexisting real estate stress test (REST), and the borrowers interconnectedness index. Furthermore, we continue to enhance our surveillance tools.  We are also exploring newtechnologies such as big data analytics to further improve our surveillance. Finally, we are reinforcing our model-based assessments with qualitative and expert judgmentson current macroeconomic and financial conditions.Other game-changing financial sector reformsPart of our transformative policy reform agenda is to accelerate financial market development. We give particular focus to foreign exchange (FX) and local currency debt markets. We envisiona more balanced financial ecosystem where the banking system is complemented by a deepand liquid debt market.Our bold financial sector reform agenda includes ambitious FX reforms toward a more organizedFX market that supports a flexible and market-determined exchange rate.  This includes furtherliberalizing FX rules to reduce the cost of doing business and to improve data capture.  4 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
In addition, we will enhance governance and oversight over the FX markets, including theUSD/PHP market.  This will further improve transparency, price discovery, and market conduct. We are currently drafting the governance framework for FX markets with a set of generalprinciples that shall apply not only to the existing USD/PHP market, but also to any thirdcurrency/PHP market that may be established in the future.  We have initiated engagement withthe industry so that existing trading markets can conform to the new framework within a mutuallyagreed timeframe.As you know, the BSP is also collaborating closely with other government agencies and industryassociations such as MART, to implement the Philippine local currency debt marketdevelopment roadmap.  Immediate focus is on deepening liquidity, enhancing price discoveryand strengthening regulatory oversight.  Recently, the Bureau of the Treasury released the implementing guidelines for the enhancedGovernment Securities Eligible Dealers (GSED) Program outlining incentives and accountabilityof market-makers.  We count on your continued support in this endeavour, including providingeffective two-way quotes to support market liquidity. Even as we move towards further liberalization and increased market incentives, we likewiseexpect responsible behavior among market players, by adhering to market standards and rules inorder to protect the integrity of the financial markets. We have a collective responsibility toconsistently build our markets to rise above the craving for short-term gains.ConclusionIndeed, maintaining mindfulness and practicing vigilance will allow us to manage risks. And evenbeyond this task of risk management, we are positive that our favorable fundamentals and amplepolicy tools give us the confidence to pursue proactive and bold financial sector reforms towardsa more efficient, flexible, and market-oriented environment.As I close, I leave you with a principle that guides us in the BSP as we fulfil our mandates: With mindfulness, we are aware of the present moment, but with vigilance, we are alert andwatchful at all times. It is a good principle to live by, whether in central banking or in all other concerns of life. Thankyou and mabuhay! 5 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches

     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 2  2   Thank you for the opportunity to be here this afternoon at this important conference, speaking on behalf of the Bank of England as Deputy Governor with responsibility for the UK’s RTGS1 and the CHAPS high value payment systems.    We are discussing the latest stage in the evolution of the UK’s financial services sector and London’s role as a global financial centre.  Different infrastructures supported this evolution at different stages.   My focus will be on the technological infrastructure to support fintech, where both private and public sectors have a role to play.  These are not new themes.  At the time of the Big Bang, new technology was required to support electronic trading. The Bank of England contributed to the infrastructure development, setting up the Central Gilts Office in 1986 - which permitted delivery versus payment for Gilts2. In 1996 the same was enabled for equities and corporate bonds via CREST, and later that year the launch of RTGS eliminated intraday settlement risk between banks, delivering real time settlement finality of sterling transactions.   The need for the Bank of England to continue to play its part in contributing to the infrastructure of the financial sector is more relevant today than ever.   Access to payments and infrastructure has changed for consumers – contactless payments are a daily reality for many now, and smartphone payments are sharply on the rise.  But the fundamental role of banks as intermediaries, and the structure of the UK retail banking industry, has remained much the same.  There are signs of evolution – such as the entry of 36 new banks3 over the past 4 years.  But arguably, finance has yet to face its “Uber” moment.  It is important that the Bank of England is attuned to the needs and challenges of a changing financial sector so that it can translate that to facilitating the infrastructure changes needed to support the UK’s financial sector and fintech development.  But how to do this? In my view, by being open.  More specifically, by the Bank of England being open minded, keeping an open door, and being open to change.  Open minded  To react appropriately to an evolving financial sector, the Bank of England needs to make sure it is open minded to the opportunities and potential for change that fintech offers.                                                          1 The UK’s Real-Time Gross Settlement infrastructure, operated by the Bank. 2 George, E (1996)  3 36 legal entities have received deposit-taking permissions since April 2013 which includes overseas firms setting up subsidiaries. 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 3  3   As a member of the Monetary Policy Committee, I need to be open minded about the way fintech could impact the economy of the UK. The defining trend of the last ten years has been the weakness of productivity.  Given the size of the financial sector in the UK, I can see fintech driving competition and a  pick-up in productivity in the medium term4.    And as a member of the Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee, in line with our remit5, I need to be open minded about, not just the risks, but the opportunities fintech could pose to the financial system.  The FPC recently discussed the current risks posed by crypto-assets and judged that they do not pose a material risk to UK financial stability6.    We judge that crypto-assets themselves may have limited utility, particularly as money. They are too volatile to be a store of value, and with high transaction costs and slow settlement times, they are an inefficient medium of exchange7.  However, we also recognise the opportunities in the technologies that underpin crypto-assets.   Adapting these technologies for the demands of the financial system poses significant challenges. Balancing the resilience, performance and privacy features of distributed ledger technology is not an easy problem to solve – and many developments are currently focusing on performance and privacy, at the potential cost of resilience.  But the distributed ledger and cryptographic technologies used by crypto-assets have the future potential to deliver benefits both to the financial system and to the economy it serves, including increasing efficiency and resilience and contributing to a more distributed and diverse payments system.     It is clear that the developments taking place in the financial sector now could impact how the Bank of England meets our mission to promote the good of the people by maintaining monetary and financial stability.  But to assess this properly, we cannot operate in isolation. We welcome the Government’s Fintech Sector Strategy, including the announcement of a Treasury/FCA/Bank of England taskforce 8 – a key element of this Strategy, which will explore further the risks of crypto-assets and the potential benefits of the underlying distributed ledger technology.  The Bank of England also needs to make sure its door remains open to engagement with the experts and innovators in the private sector too.   Open doors  We have been doing this.  Over the past two years the Bank of England’s award-winning9 Fintech Accelerator has worked with industry, experimenting with new technology and developing our understanding                                                       4Ramsden, D (2018) 5 HM Treasury (2017) 6 Bank of England  (2018) 7 Carney, M  (2018) 8 HM Treasury (2018 ) 9 Central Banking Magazine ‘s Initiative of the Year (2018)  
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 4  4   in the process.  We have carried out a number of proofs of concepts including those using distributed ledger technology, RegTech, machine learning and cyber security10.    The Accelerator-run proofs of concepts allowed us to change our mind-set to be less bound by convention in terms of how we run the Bank of England, as an infrastructure provider, a payment systems operator and a regulator.  We are now looking to build on the success of the Accelerator by integrating its key approaches into our business as usual activities.  So today I can announce that we have set up a new Fintech Hub that will sit at the heart of the Bank, to consider both how the Bank understands and how it applies fintech, relevant to its mission.  It is important that we continue to do this with our doors firmly open.  So the Hub will be a central point of contact for the fintech sector to engage with the Bank, and will play an active role in the new HMT/FCA/Bank taskforce.  And it will engage with you to understand and apply these developments to support the next wave of innovation in finance, and ensure that the UK has the right infrastructure to support that into the future.    Being open in our minds and approach are important steps in embracing and supporting new technology.  But we also need to be open to change to fulfil our mission and keep pace with an evolving financial sector.  Open to change  Change is already afoot.  The Open Banking standard and PSD211 introduce changes to access of account information and initiation of payments, requiring banks to make customer data available to authorised third parties if customers so choose. This may change the way that customers access and operate their bank accounts, such as by making them accessible via a single smartphone app developed by a third party12.  As the prudential regulator of UK financial services firms, the Bank of England needs to be open in how it considers and responds to changes arising in retail banking from this reform.  In fact, increasing competitive pressures in retail banking, enabled in part by an increase in the use of fintech, formed part of the biennial exploratory scenario in our 2017 stress test13.    As well as looking at these infrastructure changes impacting the firms we regulate, we are also opening ourselves to change by experimenting with new technologies when we think about enhancing how we work – including for the infrastructure we are responsible for.                                                          10 Hauser, A (2017) 11Europe’s second Payment Services Directive  12Cunliffe, J (2018)   13Bank of England (2017a) 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 5  5   The Bank of England is currently investing in its RTGS service14, a critical piece of national infrastructure, renewing the heart of the UK’s overall payment system to meet the challenges posed by a rapidly changing landscape. The Bank has already established arrangements under which non-bank payment service providers could access RTGS directly. We are now using the Fintech Accelerator’s proof-of-concept approach when considering how new technologies can plug into the renewed RTGS. We recognise the potential for new technologies to create a more distributed and diverse payments system. So we are doing a proof-of-concept with a small cohort of firms to consider how our renewed service could interface with innovative settlement systems15, such as those built on distributed ledger technology.   The proof of concept is designed to assess the demands that would be placed on central RTGS infrastructure by a range of fintech firms’ settlement models, rather than assessing the specific offering provided by a particular firm.  By allowing a range of system structures to access the new RTGS system, the Bank can support innovation in the private sector.  And the Bank of England is continuing to investigate ways in which fintech could help to improve regulation, building on existing work internally and in collaboration with the FCA.  We have initiated work to understand how machine readable technology could be applied to the next iteration of the PRA rulebook, and will continue to work closely with the FCA to understand the potential for machine readable regulation.  We are also investigating if machine learning could be deployed to support judgement based supervision, via its application to both structured and unstructured data.  Investment in the UK’s financial technology is going to be an important factor in sustaining the UK’s global position. With its open approach of considering, adapting to, and applying fintech across the breadth of its mission, including through its own investments, the Bank will play its part.                                                            14 Bank of England (2017b) 15 The proof of concept connects firms to a specifically built, offline version of RTGS so that the live RTGS system is protected.

Gent Sejko: Bank of Albania’s engagement in financial educationAddress by Mr Gent Sejko, Governor of the Bank of Albania, at the opening ceremony of theMoney Week 12-18 March 2018, Tirana, 12 March 2018.*   *   *Dear Mr Pedrazzi,Dear students, teachers and friends of the Global Week,Like in previous years, I have the pleasure to welcome you today to our central building, andthank you for your participation in the Money Week 2018.This is a special year as it marks a decade of Bank of Albania’s engagement in financialeducation, which meaningfully started with a Memorandum of Cooperation signed with theMinistry of Education.Over these years, financial education and financial inclusion have increasingly held a significantplace in our work, in designing and implementing numerous educational projects.They are dedicated to different age groups, and consist of a variety of initiatives ranging fromtraining and brochures to the high school elective module “Personal Finance in Your Hands”, theeducational package for the elementary schools and the Albanian Money app.Moreover, the Museum of the Bank of Albania, our utmost effort in this regard, offers/provides amultifunctional space, where visitors may not only learn more about the monetary history inAlbania and the central bank, but also deepen their financial literacy and expand their financialawareness.As a result of all these valuable experiences, we have been able to participate with dignity in theMoney Week, which, in 2018, is celebrated in more than 135 countries.The week of 12–18 March 2018 is internationally known as the Money Week. Initiated by Childand Youth Finance International, with the support of the Organisation for Economic Co-operationand Development (OECD), and adopted by more than 23.000 organisations across the globe,the Money Week is an annual financial awareness campaign built to inspire children and youngpeople to learn about money matters, livelihoods and entrepreneurship.The celebration of this Week aims at raising the awareness of the younger generation to beresponsible future citizens and capable of making well-informed financial decisionsFollowing the tradition from the previous years, the Bank of Albania, in cooperation with theAlbanian Association of Banks, with the support of the Ministry of Education, Sports, and Youth,like many other institutions worldwide, will organize various activities to involve children andyoung people, teaching them how to manage money, to save money, to think financially, tounderstand the changes in the economic systems where they live, to earn income throughentrepreneurship, and set the foundations for their future through financial literacy. In the light ofthese objectives, during the Week, a number of activities will be organised such as lectures,contests, and visits to commercial banks and the Museum, aimed at including as many studentsas possible.This year’s motto “Money: You reap what you sow” highlights the importance of money mattersas a necessary means to achieve and maintain welfare. The activities that will take place duringthis Week seek to draw the attention of the children and young people to the significance ofpersonal finance and the impact of well-informed decisions on the personal success of each oneof us individually, and of the whole society. 1 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
Like in any other educational activity of the Bank of Albania, beyond the message that we want toconvey, we consider that the inspiration, originality and pro-active thinking are determinantelements for an effective comprehension of a complex, at the same time practical, topic such asfinances.We may proudly say that all the submissions for the contests are characterised by theseelements, thus demonstrating that, though challenging, the financial education of children andyoung people may be and is possible. Moreover, their work and commitment is an incentive to usto introduce more ambitious projects and expand this activity, geographically, each year.The contests for students from nine-year schools and high schools have been welcomed andthe number of participants has been higher each year. This year, around 55 nine-year schools,14 high schools, 8 universities and over 1000 pupils and students in 14 cities were involved. Thissuccess is also owed to the teachers and professors, whose passion has contributed tomaterialising all these efforts.Concluding, I would like to thank you all for the insofar cooperation and avail myself of theopportunity to invite all the participating institutions to continue and intensify the cooperation in thefuture, in the commitment to contribute to the future generations and the Albanian society. 2 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches

The major event is our 350th anniversary as Sweden’s central bank, which will be celebrated in different ways during the year. Furthermore, it is 25 years since the Riksbank announced its inflation target, which was a milestone in Swedish monetary policy. It also happens to be 20 years almost to the day since the Swedish Riksdag took the decision to strengthen the Riksbank’s position and, as part of this work, to create a Riksbank Executive Board with the responsibility for conducting monetary policy independently.1  As well as being a reason to celebrate, anniversaries can also give us cause to pause and reflect on what has been, where we are and where we are heading. My intention here today is to perform just such a positioning exercise. A general reflection is that monetary policy internationally and in Sweden finds itself in an environment that in many ways differs from the one we have been experiencing for a long time. It is not merely a question of changes in economic activity. Structural shifts in the economy and changes in underlying trends have also created uncertainty about what the “new normal” will be in the future.  It is sometimes said in the debate that these changes have made it more or less impossible for the Riksbank to keep inflation at such a high level as 2 per cent. We should therefore either relate to our existing inflation target more freely or simply lower it. I think this line of reasoning is misdirected. There is no doubt that it is possible to get inflation to pick up, but it can be done in different ways. The challenge is to create the right amount of inflation in an orderly manner and with reasonable precision. This is the challenge facing monetary policy and it is in this context that the new environment plays a role.                                                             ∗ In particular, I would like to thank Björn Andersson for assistance writing this speech. I would also like to thank Charlotta Edler, Jesper Hansson, Per Jansson, Tomas Lundberg, Ann-Leena Mikiver, Åsa Olli Segendorf, Cecilia Roos-Isaksson, Marianne Sterner, Ulf Söderström and Anders Vredin for valuable comments. 1 The Bank of the Estates of the Realm, later renamed Sveriges Riksbank, was founded on 22 September 1668. The inflation target was announced in a press release on 15 January 1993. The press release specified that the target of 2 per cent inflation would begin to apply from 1 January 1995. The Riksdag approved the Swedish Gov-ernment’s proposal to strengthen the Riksbank’s position on 4 March 1998. The changes came into force on 1 January 1999. 
       2 [13]  In a moment I will look more closely at the new environment and discuss a few properties that characterise it and that monetary policy will need to relate to going forward. Lastly, I also intend to provide an overall picture of what might characterise the way forward. But before doing that, allow me to say something about what has brought us here.  Where we are coming from I spoke earlier about 2018 being a year of celebration. Another anniversary, but one which does not give cause for any kind of celebration, is that it is also ten years since the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers. The problems on international financial markets, which had been escalating for a long time, came to a head. Confidence in the financial system evaporated and the financial crisis was upon us.  Much has happened during the ten years since then. The actions of central banks during this period have not just been about managing the direct crisis of 2008, even though many of the problems stem from there. It is more accurate to describe the actions as reactions to an interconnected series of crises, or, if you like, a crisis that consists of several phases. These have, in turn, formed the backdrop to the different phases of monetary policy that Sweden has gone through.  Upturn cut short by sovereign debt problems in 2011–2012  An effect of the severe crisis of 2008 was a shutdown in global trade, which brought the Swedish economy to a sudden halt. To support the economy, the Riksbank quickly lowered the repo rate to a, at the time, historically low level of 0.25 per cent. Around the world, other central banks and governments made herculean efforts to kick-start the financial system and reverse the trend. As the situation on the credit markets improved and global trade picked up, the recovery occurred more rapidly than expected in Sweden. From mid-2010, the Riksbank began raising the repo rate towards a more normal level.  But during 2011, the recovery stuttered when unease linked to the problems of heavily burdened public finances in several European countries started to affect the credit markets to an ever-increasing degree. Measures by institutions such as the EU and the ECB helped to stabilise the situation, but weak confidence and low demand among households and companies subdued European developments. This, in turn, led to a slowdown in Swedish economic activity, despite relatively high domestic demand. GDP fell again in 2012 and the Riksbank lowered the repo rate in a number of steps.   Focus on inflation and maintaining confidence in the inflation target has produced results Something which provoked head-scratching around the world during these years was that inflation remained at a relatively high level to begin with, despite the major economic slowdown after 2008. In hindsight we know that inflation gradually fell and that it happened earlier in Sweden than in other countries – 
       3 [13]  discounting the effect of interest-rate changes, inflation fell from around 2 per cent during 2010 to around 1 per cent in 2012. When inflation then fell further in late 2013 and early 2014, despite brighter economic signals, it became necessary for the Riksbank to focus more and more on bringing inflation back to the target. This was particularly urgent bearing in mind that the long period of low inflation had begun to leave its mark on inflation expectations. To bring up inflation and help anchor inflation expectations to the target, the Riksbank cut the repo rate to 0 per cent in 2014 and then gradually down to –0.5 per cent in the following years. As a way of making monetary policy more expansionary, we also began purchasing government bonds at the start of 2015. At that point, the ECB had begun buying assets on a large scale to stimulate demand and bring up inflation. There was a concern that the Swedish krona might strengthen significantly against the euro as a result of this and that this would further prolong the period of below-target inflation. Monetary policy needed to protect the economy against such a development.  Today, we can observe that the extremely low interest rate and the Riksbank’s asset purchases have contributed to economic activity growing ever stronger. Employment has risen and growth has been on or above a normal level for four years. Inflation, which has shown a rising trend since 2014, was around 2 per cent last year and long-term expectations are anchored to the target.  The start of a new chapter?  Does this mean we can now sound the all-clear? As you know, there are no guarantees in the forecasting business. Economically, things look good, not least due to increasingly high demand from abroad. It has taken a decade, but it seems as though the global economy has finally recovered enough from the after-shocks of the financial crisis to start a new chapter. The US central bank has begun normalising monetary policy. In Europe, recovery has occurred more slowly but has now reached such a stage that the ECB has reduced the rate of its asset purchases.  However, global inflationary pressures are still modest and the new outcomes for Swedish inflation have been weaker than expected. For the Riksbank, it is a question of remaining vigilant. A prerequisite for inflation to continue to develop in line with the target is that economic activity remains strong and has an impact on price developments. Monetary policy therefore still needs to remain expansionary. But if everything goes as expected, the time to start normalising monetary policy will come closer. The assessment we made in February was that it is probably time to slowly start raising the repo rate during the second half of this year. But such a turnaround requires considerable caution, in my opinion.  As regards the Riksbank’s holdings of government bonds, we presented an overall strategy for normalisation before Christmas.2 In brief, it states that the Riksbank shall continue to reinvest redemptions and coupon payments until the repo rate                                                            2 See the article “The Riksbank’s strategy for a gradual normalisation of monetary policy” in the December 2017 Monetary Policy Report. 
       4 [13]  has reached a suitable level. Thereafter, reinvestments can also be scaled back. When this happens, bond holdings will decrease.  What the environment looks like going forward Economically, things look relatively good and if everything goes as expected, monetary policy internationally and in Sweden will gradually and slowly move closer to a normal situation. But in what kind of environment will monetary policy be conducted going forward? And what does this normal situation actually look like? These are questions that have come increasingly into focus in recent years.  It would probably be a mistake to take it for granted that the same map used before the crisis can be used to get our bearings in the current situation. To begin with, it is important to properly evaluate the experience gained over the last decade and integrate the lessons learned into our economic thinking. Structural changes may also have influenced underlying trends in the economy and I would like to give three examples of such changes which, in some way or other, will influence Swedish monetary policy in the future.  Lower interest rates on average than before To start with, it can be noted that we find ourselves in an environment where interest rates are much lower than before. “You’ve made your bed so you must lie in it”, someone may object – is it not central banks themselves that have created this environment? It is true that policy rates have been cut significantly to support economic activity and return to inflation targets. But the fact that this has caused policy rates to fall to extremely low levels is because central banks needed to adapt to a general downward trend in interest rates around the world, a trend that began a long time before the financial crisis in 2008.  Declining trend in real interest rates on a global level Returns and interest expenditure adjusted for inflation are important to households and companies, as they make decisions on saving and investment. In other words, it is real interest rates that matter. By changing the nominal policy rate, the central bank can affect the real interest rate in the near term and thus demand in the economy. This is possible, as it takes time for companies to adapt their prices to the change in the policy rate and other interest rates in the economy. But once prices have been adjusted, the real interest rate is also reset. In the longer term, therefore, monetary policy has no major effect on real interest rates. In this time perspective, it is structural factors, such as demographics and long-term growth rates, that affect developments.  One striking feature over recent decades is the downward trend in real interest rates around the world. Various explanations have been put forward for this, including demographic trends.3 One theory that has attracted major attention is that the decline is a sign of secular stagnation, where different factors have driven up saving but dampened the propensity to invest. This has led to a chronic                                                            3 A more detailed description of the decline in global real interest rates and feasible explanations can be found in my speech at the Swedish Economics Association in 2017. 
       5 [13]  condition of “excessively low” demand in the economy, which has contributed to a lasting decline in real interest rates. Others think that it is not necessarily a question of secular stagnation, but that the situation can, for example, be better described as a deep recession following excessively high debt accumulation in many countries.   An environment with a lower average repo rate The major question is what we can expect going forward. For a small, open economy like Sweden's, the interest rate on a global level is important as it affects domestic rates. With free movement of capital, it is difficult to have real interest rates that deviate a great deal from the global level in the long run, even if differences in demographic trends or long-term productivity growth can naturally play a part. It is true enough that real interest rates in Sweden have exhibited a similar downward trend to real interest rates internationally. This is of significance for monetary policy as it implies that the Riksbank’s repo rate is lower on average. And a lower repo rate on average means that the margin down to zero and minus rates decreases – I will come back to the implications of this in a moment.   How long will low real interest rates last? The answer naturally depends on what are believed to be the most important driving-forces behind developments. But regardless of whether you believe that it is a permanent phenomenon or that there is a more cyclical explanation, the low interest-rate environment will probably last for some time to come. Even if interest rates will rise in the near term, it is towards a lower average level than previously. Many central banks, including the Riksbank, have adjusted down their assessments of long-term policy rate levels. Our current assessment is that the repo rate will, in the long run, be between 2.5 and 4.0 per cent.4 But it will probably take a long time before we reach that level.  Higher interest-rate sensitivity among households One effect of the decline in interest rates in Sweden is, as we all know, the increase in household indebtedness. Seen over the last twenty years, debt in relation to disposal household income has almost doubled. Currently, aggregate household debt is almost twice the level of income. For around a quarter of a million households, debt is 6 times greater than income or higher.  High indebtedness linked to rising housing prices As most of the debt consists of mortgages, the growing indebtedness reflects the development in housing prices. Prices of detached or semi-detached houses have tripled in the last 20 years, while prices of tenant-owned apartments have increased at an even faster rate. The rapid price increase depends on several factors, in addition to the low interest rate level. The population and income have increased, driving up housing demand while new housing construction has lagged behind, apart from in the most recent years. The abolition of property tax is also a                                                            4 See the article "The repo rate in the long run” in the February 2017 Monetary Policy Report, Sveriges Riksbank. 
       6 [13]  factor that might explain the growing indebtedness, as is the fact that an increasing number of households own their own home.5   The rate of increase in lending to households is still on a high level. The Riksbank’s assessment of future developments is that overall household debt will not rise at quite such a high rate as in recent years, due to more subdued housing price growth. But debt is still expected to increase more rapidly than disposable income. So the debt-to-income ratio will continue to rise. High indebtedness is making household finances more sensitive to interest rate adjustments When monetary policy gradually starts to normalise and interest rates rise, it will happen against this backdrop of high indebtedness among households and high housing market valuation. In addition, many have taken out variable-rate mortgages with short interest-rate fixation periods. Taken together, this means that household finances are now more sensitive to adjustments in interest rates than before. Disposable income, that is income minus borrowing costs, is affected to a greater extent by interest rate adjustments when debt is high, all other factors being equal.  Calculations show that an interest-rate rise of about 1 percentage point now has a significantly greater direct effect on household disposable income than in the mid-1990s. In this sense, households’ interest-rate sensitivity is now greater.6 The interesting question is whether households adapt their consumption to a corresponding degree so that consumption also changes to a greater extent. It need not necessarily be so. For example, interest income can offset the effect of higher interest expenditure. If households also plan in advance for a scenario where interest expenditure takes a greater share of their income, consumption may not necessarily be affected to any great extent.  But research findings point to this potentially playing a major role at least for certain groups of households.7 More specifically, it is shown that highly indebted households with variable-rate mortgages adapt their consumption to a greater extent than other households when interest rates change. This may be due to an interest rate adjustment affecting their disposable income to a greater extent, as I just described. But it may also be due to highly indebted households reacting more to a given change in income than other households. You would expect this to be the case if households with high debt do not have the same opportunity as others to maintain their consumption by borrowing more.                                                             5 See Sveriges Riksbank (2011), The Riksbank’s inquiry into risks on the Swedish housing market, and Hansen, S. (2013), Explanations of the development of household indebtedness since the mid-1990s, Memorandum 1. Fi-nansinspektionen. 6 See the article “How are households affected by rising interest rates?” in the December 2017 Monetary Policy Report, and Gustafsson, P. et al (2017), How are household cashflows and consumption affected by higher inter-est rates? Staff memo, Sveriges Riksbank. 7 See, for instance, Flodén, M. et al (2017), “Household Debt and Monetary Policy: Revealing the Cash-Flow Chan-nel”. Sveriges Riksbank Working Paper Series 342. Sveriges Riksbank.  
       7 [13]  Greater interest-rate sensitivity creates uncertainty about the impact of monetary policy   How total consumption will be affected when interest rates are gradually raised towards more normal levels is difficult to know. Interest expenditure will increase, and for some households by a relatively large extent. But the total effect will also depend on what happens in the economy otherwise as regards income from employment, housing prices, expectations, etc. It is difficult to include all such factors, but calculations show that we should expect a given interest-rate increase to subdue consumption for mortgage holders more now than in the mid-1990s.8  At least for certain groups, monetary policy therefore has a greater impact on the real economy now than previously. This could justify slower rate hikes than has been the case in similar economic situations in previous years. For other groups of households, on the other hand, the impact of rate hikes is not as great. There is hence an intrinsic tension here. The Riksbank has only one policy rate and it is adapted to aggregate demand and the economic outlook in general, and above all to how inflation will develop. Higher interest-rate sensitivity and the extent to which it affects the impact of monetary policy will, in other words, be a source of uncertainty. It will, after all, be a challenge to have a situation for a number of years in which interest rates rise – albeit slowly – while debt is higher than ever before.  The supply of labour is greater From household consumption and the demand side of the economy, I would like to go on to the labour market and the supply side and my third and final example of the transformation of the economic landscape.  Migration and reforms behind labour force participation Various structural changes have meant that the Swedish labour market differs considerably from the structure in the mid-1990s, and in the ten years since the financial crisis alone, a great deal has happened. One such change is that the number of persons at the disposal of the labour market has grown significantly. Since 2006, the number of persons in the labour force aged 15–74 has increased by over half a million.9 This means that the share of the working-age population participating in the labour force is now the highest for almost thirty years.  Several factors lie behind this. The working-age population has increased, much as a result of Sweden’s substantial intake of refugees. Various reforms in recent decades have also increased the incentives to participate in the labour force by making it more profitable to work and to continue working to a more advanced age. Relatively better health and level of education also seem to have contributed to a rather large increase in the labour force participation rate among older people.10 We should also remember that the increasingly strong economic                                                            8 See Finocchiaro, D. et al (2016), “Macroeconomic effects of reducing household debt”, Economic Review 2016:2, Sveriges Riksbank. 9 See Flodberg, C. and Löf, M. (2017), “Labour supply has increased surprisingly rapidly”, Staff memo, Sveriges Riksbank.  10 Laun, L. and Palme, M. (2017), “The recent rise of labor force participation of older workers in Sweden,” Report 2017:18, Institute for Evaluation of Labour Market and Education Policy. 
       8 [13]  situation in recent years has probably made it more attractive to participate in the labour force. Monetary policy cannot solve structural challenges with greater labour supply  Higher labour supply is basically positive as it should lead to higher employment in the long term – which is beneficial not least in light of the challenges we face as regards a greying population. Higher labour force participation in the long term raises the economy’s output potential, which means that the wheels can turn more quickly without the risk of overheating and rising prices, which monetary policy ultimately needs to subdue.  But a prerequisite for this positive effect is that the increased labour supply also leads to higher employment. As it takes time for the labour market to adapt to rapidly increasing supply, it is likely that the increase will, in part, result in higher unemployment in the near term. High demand in the economy can facilitate the adjustment. But the extent to which greater labour supply leads to higher employment in the longer term is determined by how the labour market works and by the matching of job-seekers to vacancies. This is particularly true of groups with a vulnerable position on the labour market, for example persons born outside Europe.  We have had a strong labour market in recent years and not only the labour force but also employment are now on a historically high level. The expansionary monetary policy has contributed to this development. But there are signs that the matching of job-seekers to vacancies is not working well. The decrease in unemployment in recent years has, above all, been among those born in Sweden. For this group, unemployment is now on a very low level. Unemployment among those born abroad, on the other hand, has not decreased to the same extent and is significantly higher to begin with. A greater supply of foreign-born labour creates the conditions for long-term higher employment, but it is important that the labour market functions efficiently so that the supply of labour can be fully utilised. With a greying population, this will also become increasingly urgent as the demand for labour in areas such as health and social care rises.   Despite the economic situation continuing to be strong and both the labour force and employment being expected to increase further in the future, it is the Riksbank’s assessment that unemployment is not expected to fall much more in the years ahead. So, to keep unemployment down – and above all to bring it down significantly below its current level – measures are needed within policy areas other than monetary policy. I do not mean by this that monetary policy has been exhausted. There is scope to make it even more expansionary if need be. But monetary policy cannot be expected to be able to solve structural problems on the labour market.  What we need to carry with us Before saying a few words about the way forward for monetary policy in the new environment, I would like to dwell for a moment on the question of what expectations there should be about monetary policy. The fact is that we are 
       9 [13]  emerging from a period in which this question has, in a sense, been brought to a head. Monetary policy in recent years has been focused on bringing inflation up to the target, while consideration of other circumstances in the economy has basically had to take a back seat. I am thinking here primarily of the risks of various negative side-effects from the low level of interest rates. This is an experience we carry with us as we go forward. And it is not only of significance for monetary policy.  Confidence in the inflation target cannot be taken for granted For a long time, the Riksbank has been expressing concern for the risks posed to the economy by household indebtedness and rising housing prices. And during the period up until 2014, these risks periodically had some influence on rate-setting. As always, however, it was the economic outlook and inflation prospects that directed the focus of monetary policy. But the Riksbank made use of the flexibility in inflation targeting to help subdue debt accumulation and housing price increases to some extent. This was done by keeping the repo rate marginally higher than was justified by the outlook for inflation alone.  Flexible inflation targeting means in practice that the aim is not to bring inflation back to the target as quickly as possible if it deviates from 2 per cent. But a precondition for being able to be flexible is that there are expectations of inflation still returning to target in the longer run. The inflation target has been the nominal anchor in the Swedish economy for so long that it is easy to assume that inflation expectations automatically stay around 2 per cent. But, as developments after 2011 have shown, long-term inflation expectations are not immune to influence. A long period of sub-target inflation caused expectations to creep further and further below 2 per cent. It therefore became increasingly urgent for the Riksbank to focus on reversing the trend and bringing inflation up to the target. This turned out to require major monetary policy efforts over a long period of time.  An insight gained in recent years that therefore needs to be highlighted is that confidence in the inflation target cannot be taken for granted. The main task of monetary policy is to maintain the nominal anchor in the economy and the expectations and demands placed on monetary policy should take this as a starting-point. But on condition that confidence in the anchor is not jeopardised, monetary policy has a certain amount of scope to allow deviation from the inflation target to take a back seat in favour of other considerations.11 This might, for example, be a question of helping to mitigate risks associated with high indebtedness and rising housing prices. But, and this is important, monetary policy cannot be expected to be the solution when managing risks that stem from fundamental problems relating to the functioning of markets and the incentives for indebtedness, housing construction and employment. Other policy areas need to rectify such problems.                                                             11 See, for example, my speech at the Swedish Economics Association in 2016 for more details about this. 
       10 [13]  Reforms needed in the housing and macroprudential policy areas As a result of Sweden’s own crisis in the early-1990s, comprehensive changes were made to economic policy in order to come to terms with deficiencies that became clear during the crisis. We adopted a floating exchange rate and a framework for fiscal policy that would ensure public finances were sustainable. The changes created a stability in the Swedish economy that has been of considerable benefit, not least during the financial crisis. Sweden had the advantage of being able to tackle the economic slowdown with a fiscal policy that was not hampered by major deficits and a monetary policy.  The latest crisis was also the starting point for changes in economic policy areas, primarily to mitigate the risks of financial imbalances once again creating problems for the economy as a whole. But the difference is that Sweden still, ten years after the crisis, has not really managed to fully implement these changes.   The most concrete example of reform based on the lessons learned from the crisis is that macroprudential policy has been established as a separate economic policy area. Over the last ten years, intensive efforts have been made around the world to define and implement macroprudential policy. Sweden has made some progress but more needs to be done. At the end of last year, Finansinspektionen, which has the main responsibility for macroprudential policy, was given the go-ahead by the Government to introduce a tougher amortisation requirement. This is, in itself, a positive development. But a regulatory framework that makes macroprudential policy more flexible needs to be put in place so that measures can be implemented quickly when necessary.  Macroprudential policy can be specifically focused on reducing the risks associated with household debt. But the Riksbank’s assessment is that a combination of different measures is required in several policy areas to reduce these risks.12 Above all, the fundamental causes of rising indebtedness need to be dealt with, something that is difficult to do without first tackling the Swedish housing market and its inherent imbalances. This is of course no easy task. But nevertheless an urgent one. As I mentioned earlier, the interest rate will be lower on average in the period ahead, sometimes much lower if monetary policy is to be able to meet the inflation target. The financial side of the economy needs to be robust enough to cope with such periods without macroeconomic developments being exposed to too large risks.  The way forward Structural changes and our experience over the last ten years will thus be of significance for monetary policy going forward. But what does this mean in more concrete terms?                                                             12 See Financial Stability Report 2017:2, Sveriges Riksbank. 
       11 [13]  The main direction is determined by international developments To begin with, it is important to bear in mind that the Swedish economy is very dependent on developments abroad. Just as before, the main direction of the Swedish economy will follow international developments. I have already discussed how significant the global level of interest rates is for interest rates in Sweden and hence for monetary policy. In addition, the economic outlook and inflation prospects will, to a large extent, be influenced by what happens abroad, especially in the rest of Europe.  One special circumstance is that economic activity and normalisation of economic policy will be in a different phase in the euro area than in the United States in the coming period. This is not so strange given developments over the last ten years. But as Swedish economic activity has been stronger than in the euro area, normalisation here at home looks as though it might start earlier than in the euro area, according to our forecast. In other words, we will probably be after the US central bank but slightly before the ECB. This is a special situation that can affect the impulses from abroad as regards economic activity and inflationary pressures.  Inflation can rise in different ways. Lately, price pressures from abroad have been subdued and the upturn in inflation has largely been domestically driven, primarily via price increases in the service sector. The combination of wage and price developments in domestic sectors and inflationary impulses from abroad will determine how monetary policy should be designed to influence domestic demand and the exchange rate in the desired direction, so that inflation ultimately stays around the target. To some extent, it will of course be less complicated for monetary policy if inflationary pressures both rise abroad and in domestic sectors and in ways we are used to – and the risks of imbalances may then also be mitigated.  Complementary monetary policy measures may be the norm As I mentioned earlier, the environment of low real interest rates will probably last for quite some time to come, which means that the policy rates of central banks will on average be on a lower level. This may, in turn, limit the scope of central banks to tackle economic downturns by cutting policy rates. Say, for example, that the repo rate will on average be around 2.5 per cent, that is, at the lower bound in the Riksbank’s assessment of the long-term level. That does not provide much leeway down to zero. As we have shown, it is possible to lower the rate some way below zero but it is clear that there may be less scope for rate cuts than previously.  Discussions are ongoing among central banks as to what the significance of low interest rates will be for monetary policy and how the scope for monetary policy to act in economic slowdowns can be increased. One conclusion is that complementary monetary policy measures of the type used by many central banks in recent years, such as the purchasing of various assets, may become more common in the future. Other feasible measures in the monetary policy toolbox are loans directly to companies via banks, and foreign exchange interventions.  
       12 [13]  The new environment also affects other policy areas Another possibility is other policy areas being used more actively to stimulate the economy in times of recession. In the international debate, it has, for example, been said that the limitations imposed on monetary policy by the low interest-rate environment mean that fiscal policy may need to contribute to stabilisation policy to a greater extent than before.13  I think, to start with, that it is important to point out that monetary policy has not be exhausted as a result of the policy rate being lowered as far as is practically possible. As I just mentioned, there are several tools in the monetary policy toolbox that can be used if need be, in order to stimulate the economy. That said, there are obviously feasible tools in other policy areas as well. And it is reasonable to evaluate the costs and benefits of using all these different tools so that economic policy is as efficient and effective as possible for the economy as a whole. But how the various tools are used is a matter for those responsible for the different policy areas and as regards fiscal policy, it is of course the Riksdag and the Government that determine how and on what grounds it is to be conducted.  Price stability still the basis for monetary policy In conclusion – the decade we are emerging from was characterised by crises and a deep, long-lasting recession. In that perspective, it is difficult not to describe the future as brighter – to refer back to the question which is the title of today’s seminar. As always, there are uncertainty factors, but the Riksbank’s assessment is that the economic outlook is still good both in Sweden and abroad. For monetary policy, it is a question of ensuring that inflation continues to develop in line with our inflation target. Monetary policy therefore needs to remain expansionary so that the strong economy can have an impact on inflation and so that the Swedish krona does not appreciate too rapidly. In the near term, we also need to be pay particular attention to current downside risks. When normalisation of monetary policy is under way, it will happen in an environment that is, in many ways, different from the one we have operated in over the last ten years. I have given some examples here today. What they imply in more concrete terms for the actual design of monetary policy is something that the Riksbank has to continue to ponder. But the new environment will not just set challenges for monetary policy, but for other policy areas as well. How we face up to these challenges will of course be a deciding factor in how bright the future will be in practice. I therefore assume that other policy areas in a similar fashion are considering which structural measures are necessary. As we know, discussions are ongoing, both in Sweden and abroad, on the need for more comprehensive changes to the way monetary policy is conducted, so that, among other things, it is better adapted to a “new normal” environment. It is an interesting discussion that we have every reason to revisit, not least once the Parliamentary Review Commission has made more progress in its work. For the time being, it is worth noting that the discussion in principle centres on                                                            13 See, for instance, Blanchard, O. and Summers, L.

Ong Chong Tee: Banking supervision - the path aheadOpening address by Mr Ong Chong Tee, Deputy Managing Director (Financial Supervision) ofthe Monetary Authority of Singapore, at the 13th Asia-Pacific High Level Meeting on BankingSupervision, Singapore, 28 February 2018.*   *   *Mr Agustin Carstens, General Manager, BIS Mr Fernando Restoy, Chairman, FSI Mr William Coen, Secretary General, BCBS Ms Chuchi Fonacier, Chairman, EMEAP WGBS and Deputy Governor, BSPDistinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,1   Good morning. My colleagues and I at the MAS are pleased to host this 13th Asia-Pacific HighLevel Meeting on Banking Supervision. It is also my honour to be able to offer some remarks toprecede the interesting panel sessions over the next two days.Basel III reforms2   It has been a decade since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. Since then, wide-rangingregulatory reforms have been formulated to further safeguard the stability and functioning of theglobal financial system.One major set of the reforms is the Basel III standards for banks; and this includes boostingcapital buffers, new liquidity requirements and limiting overall leverage.The Financial Stability Board (FSB) also led work to address “too-big-to-fail” concerns.Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs) are now subject to higher capital, moreintense supervision, and resolution planning requirements.3   The recent finalisation of the 2017 Basel III reforms complete the post-crisis banking reformagenda. The Basel Committee and global banking regulators have shifted focus toimplementation of the revised standards. Given the considerable attention on the Basel IIIreforms, it is easy to forget that a core mandate of the Basel Committee is with respect to itswork on supervisory practices.4   So this morning, allow me to share some thoughts on three areas with respect to bankingsupervision:    i. The Next Phase – beyond the review on Capital and Liquidity rules;     ii. Banking Supervision as a Craft; and      iii. Supervisory Challenges and Opportunities.The next phase5   As many of us will be familiar, the Basel III framework has a second Pillar that pertains to riskmanagement and supervision including accounting for risks not captured under Pillar 1. Indeed,the Basel Committee devotes considerable attention to various pieces of work under this Pillar,such as on stress testing, accounting standards, corporate governance and supervisorycolleges. Disclosure requirements are further reviewed under Pillar 3 to foster market discipline.6   Following the recent finalisation of Basel III, the next phase will be centred on a “full, timely andconsistent” implementation globally. This is important to reduce risk of regulatory arbitrage. Everyjurisdiction or region will of course be different in the degree of openness, internationalisation,and the maturity and sophistication of their banking systems. The Basel Committee has been 1 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
mindful that its standards are calibrated as minimum requirements, and in limited situations,some supervisory discretions have been provided including the use of Pillar 2. 7   Risk proportionality is not a new concept in international banking rules. The Basel Committeehas sought to further embed risk proportionality within its framework.One such example is the simplified alternative to the Standardised Approach to Market Risk,or SA-MR in short. This simplified alternative will make it easier for supervisory authorities toimplement the market risk rules for less complex banks.For such simplified approaches to be fit-for-purpose, it has to take into account the differingconditions across a broad range of jurisdictions. This is especially so for emerging marketeconomies with less complex banking systems. In this respect, forums such as the Basel’sRegional Consultative Group (RCG) and the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-PacificCentral Banks (EMEAP) can be important platforms for regional regulators to continue toprovide feedback or regional concerns.Where the outcomes from impact studies are less certain, the Basel Committee has beencareful not to rush into a particular rule. One example is the treatment of sovereign riskexposures. In this case, the Basel Committee has decided to put out a discussion paper tosolicit further views.8   The Financial Stability Institute (FSI) has also recently published an insightful report onproportionality in banking regulation. The report provides a very useful overview of theproportionality approaches in different jurisdictions. 9   Another example is the Financial Stability Board’s (FSB) evaluation of effects of reforms. Theinitial focus is on infrastructure financing, which will be relevant to Asia given the immenseinfrastructure demands.10   Asian regulators on the Basel Committee and on the FSB can help to present Asia’sperspectives at these international forums. Central banks as well as international organisationssuch as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) shouldalso weigh in to lend insights from their economic surveillance work. This will allow regionalconcerns to be sufficiently factored into the global rule-making and evaluation process. The craft of supervision11   Rules and standards cannot replace judgment. Good supervisory instincts and technicalcompetence are required to discover, scrutinize and evaluate key risks. This can only be done ifbanking supervisors do not see their role as a mere compliance function. An effective bankingsupervisor must be able to assess a bank’s understanding of its risks, its business practices aswell as judge its corporate governance and culture.12   The need for consistency and rigour also mean that supervisory judgment is not just anoperational matter. Having formal supervisory decision-making forums is an importantcomponent of a good supervisory process. For example, in the MAS, our Banking Supervisionheads come together in regular meetings to guide supervisory reviews and decisions. As anintegrated supervisor, I also chair a Management Financial Supervision Meeting as well as aRegulatory Actions Meeting that oversees the broad scope of our supervisory policies andenforcement actions respectively, across banking, insurance and capital markets activities. Inother words, supervisory practices require as much thought and policy considerations as therules and regulations. This is also why exchanges with fellow regulators during supervisorycolleges are very helpful and important too.13   I have earlier mentioned that rules and regulations should be risk proportionate. This is trueas well for banking supervision. It is impossible for supervisors to review and inspect all the 2 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
financial institutions under our charge to a wide and deep extent given finite resources and time.This is neither feasible nor desirable.14   It is more logical and effective to differentiate our supervisory intensity according to the riskprofiles of each bank. In recent years, MAS has also moved towards greater use of thematicreviews and inspections. This means that we inspect a peer group of institutions at a time in aspecific risk area. We find that such a peer group approach also facilitates better identification ofvulnerabilities, and allow for industry benchmarking as well as the sharing of best practices.15   An effective supervisory process should also involve a preparedness to take toughenforcement actions. It is a practical reality that no amount of regulations and supervisoryreviews can catch all possible potential misdemeanours or excessive risk-taking. To do so, afinancial regulator would have to be regularly and extensively intrusive to a point that a bankwould find it hard to function. Ultimately, a bank’s Board and Management must be responsiblefor its business conduct and risk management. 16   Hence, it is far more effective that the supervisory process work alongside strong andeffective Boards and Management in banks. If there are failings or violations that bypass oursupervisory reviews, then enforcement actions must be meted out accordingly.17   This supervisory philosophy is underscored in what is commonly described as the four linesof defence in a 2015 BIS Occasional Paper, as well as the 2015 Basel Committee’s guideline onCorporate Governance principles – that describe the roles of (a) Boards, Management andBusiness Units, (b) Risk and Compliance, (c) Internal as well as External Audit, and (d) theRegulator.Challenges and opportunities18   Much has been reported about innovations in the FinTech space, and the disruptions broughtabout by technology in practically every aspect of economic and social activities.19   Recent technological developments have also presented regulators with both newchallenges and opportunities. For instance, the foray by hitherto non-regulated entities intovarious aspects of payments and financial services could necessitate a change from aninstitution-based regulatory approach towards an activity-based framework. But at the sametime, this can also allow a regulator to “right-size” regulations for both traditional and evolvingbusiness models according to the risks the activity poses. I can cite two examples:Virtual currencies first emerged about 10 years ago. Since then, we have observed anincrease in the number of initial coin (or token) offerings in Singapore. As with most financialregulators, MAS does not regulate virtual currencies. But we regulate the activities thatsurround virtual currencies if these pose specific risks. An example would be the Anti-MoneyLaundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) requirements that we haveimposed on intermediaries providing virtual currency services. We are assessing ifadditional regulations are required for investor protection.Another example is the wave of new payment services that have been enabled by newtechnology. Consumers are increasingly making and receiving payments through digitalpayment platforms, which fall outside of our existing regulatory frameworks. In recognition ofthe risks that these digital payment platforms can pose to the system as a whole if they arenot adequately secure, MAS will be issuing a new Payment Services Bill (PSB). This willstreamline the regulation of payment and remittance service providers under a singleregulatory framework, and calibrated to whether an entity offer one, some or all parts of theretail payments value chain. It will also seek to enhance user protection and facilitate theadoption of electronic payments. 3 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
20   Regulations should not stifle innovation. The reality is that innovations will always moveahead of rules. The key is in understanding whether a particular innovation or new businessmodel is simply a regulatory arbitrage. If so, we should deal with that directly such as by bringingthat activity within the regulatory ambit or even banning it altogether. Another consideration iswhether an innovative business model while purposeful will create incoherence or inconsistencyof treatment. In such a case, a review of that regulatory policy may be necessary. There is noone-size-fits-all supervisory answer. It simply means that as regulators, we need to keep abreastwith technological developments. Only then, can we exercise thoughtful judgment. The fact thatmany financial regulators including the MAS have allowed regulatory sandboxes to be set uphighlights a preparedness to allow innovative financial models to first be tested within definedparameters.Harnessing technology to strengthen supervision21   There is a growing area of technology use that will be directly relevant to financialsupervision – Regulatory Technology (or RegTech). This is the use of advanced technologysystems and algorithms to enhance risk management and regulatory compliance.22   Many financial institutions have embraced RegTech, such as:Predictive analytics being used in stress testing;Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning-powered systems to identify money launderingrisks; andCognitive computing and behavioural algorithms to detect suspicious trading and possiblemisconduct.23   On the supervisor’s end, the MAS is developing our own ‘SupTech’ to improve and sharpenour surveillance and analytical capabilities. Since about a year ago, we have set up a dedicatedunit for SupTech within our Data Analytics Group.24   The aim is to make greater use of technology and “smart tools” to guide our financialsurveillance and supervision functions. To do so, building the infrastructure for our data analyticsprojects is important. We are putting in place an MAS Private Cloud. This will serve as thefoundation to provide computing power to all data analytics projects in MAS. There are a numberof ongoing system-enhancement projects around data storage, accessibility and usability. Butimportantly to fully benefit from the insights of a broader set of high-frequency real-time data, inboth structured and unstructured formats, our supervisors will also need to acquire strong digitalfluency in various data analytics and visualisation tools.25   Only then can we harness the full computational capabilities from better data analytics tosharpen our surveillance and understanding of different risks, and to support more effectivedecision-making. There is also a nascent area that MAS is studying together with an industrygrouping. This relates to data ethics such as on fair and transparent use of data by financialinstitutions. I am sure this will be a discussion topic in future forums.Managing cyber threats26   Given the technological developments in the financial services sector, a key priority area forregulators must be the work on Cybersecurity. To do this well, regulators will have to work inclose partnership with financial institutions, law enforcement agencies, sector agencies such asin telecommunications and power, as well as fellow regulators given the often cross-bordernature of cyber threats.To further foster the exchange of cyber intelligence in the region, MAS collaborated with theFinancial Services – Information Sharing & Analysis Centre (FS-ISAC) to establish an APAC 4 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
Regional Intelligence and Analysis Centre. This centre in Singapore provides 24/7 coverageof actionable intelligence and resources to respond to incidents.MAS also implemented a 24/7 Sectoral Security Operations Centre (SOC) to obtaininformation from intelligence sources on cyber threat targeting our financial sector.We have partnered the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) to update MAS’ TechnologyRisk Management Guidelines.Also in partnership with the ABS, we are in the process of establishing guidelines for “red-teaming” to enhance cyber security testing.27   I know that this theme of technology will feature prominently over these two days. Suchmutual sharing and learning will be an important aspect of regulatory up-levelling.Integrity and Conduct28   Last but not least, let me wrap up my remarks by highlighting the importance of strongintegrity and proper conduct in the financial industry. No amount of regulatory reforms orsupervision can assure a stable financial system if the culture and conduct of firms andindividuals are flawed. Around the business complexities of different firms, the core should be thesame – a business culture centred on doing right and doing good.29   MAS will be stepping up our supervisory reviews on various aspects of risk governance andculture in financial institutions. Recently, we conducted a culture and conduct survey among anumber of the key institutions. Based on the survey responses, we are carrying out dialogues toascertain commonalities and differences in industry practices. We are sharing our supervisoryexperiences with other regulators to learn from one another. From these, we hope to provide thebroader industry with our observations on best practices and areas for improvement.Conclusion30   I have probably spoken longer than I should. I think this only goes to show the many areas ofsupervision which the different panels will no doubt delve further into. May I wish everyone a mostfruitful and interesting meeting. I do hope that all visitors in this meeting will also be able to setaside a little time to enjoy Singapore’s lively sights and sounds. 5 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches

   All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 2  2   I am delighted to be here to discuss the final report from the RSA Citizens’ Economic Council on “Building a Public Culture of Economics”.  This is the culmination of a two-year project, working with around 250 citizens and a number of organisations from across the country, including the Bank of England.  I would like to congratulate Matthew Taylor, Chief Executive of the RSA, and Reema Patel, Kayshani Gibbon and  Tony Greenham from the RSA as leaders of the project, for their terrific work in pulling this together.  It is an impressive, progressive and ambitious agenda for the economy and for economic policymakers like me.  Of course, citizens do already have a crucial stake in the economy.  As economists we often divide the world into neat institutional packages – companies, governments, trade unions, charities.  While useful organisationally, these names are no more veils, part legal, part social.  Behind the veil lies the ultimate owner – citizens, whether as workers, customers, shareholders, stakeholders or voters.  Institutions are executive gatekeepers of these citizen democracies.  Ultimately, it is citizens to whom policymakers, economic and otherwise, are accountable.  Those of us in the policy game need never to lose sight of that.      Despite those ownership rights, it is nonetheless the RSA’s contention that citizens are not at present engaged in the economy, and in economic policy, as fully as would be desirable.  They make the case for moving to a deliberative democracy, one in which citizens have a greater say on matters economic and financial.  This is a big contention.  Nonetheless it is one that I – as a citizen and as someone who works for one of those institutional veils, the Bank of England – fully accept.  More than that, the Bank is making strides towards increasing citizen engagement in the economy and understanding of economic policy.  In what follows, let me first say a word about the aims and objectives of a programme of citizen engagement, the like of which the RSA are proposing – the “ends”.  I will then turn to the “means” – what practically could be done, and indeed is being done, to improve citizen engagement with the economy and economic policy.  For reasons of familiarity, I will focus on Bank of England initiatives as one example of such public engagement, although the RSA’s recommendations cover a range of other policymaking functions.  The Ends  So what could we hope to achieve by increasing citizens’ engagement with issues of economics and finance?  My short answer to that question is a great deal.  Economics, and economic policy, faces a “twin deficits” problem – a deficit of public understanding and a deficit of public trust.1  Twin deficits, be they fiscal and external or trust and understanding, carry dangers for the economy and for economic policy.  Closing them would, I believe, deliver significant benefits to society, to individuals and to policymakers who sit twixt the two.  Here’s why.  Let’s take public understanding of the economy.  As the public themselves would be the first to admit, this is not high and not as high as we would wish.  On economic and financial matters, there is often a yawning                                                       1  Haldane (2017a). 
   All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 3  3   understanding deficit on the part of the general public.  That is not because the public are yawning at the prospect of engaging with these issues.  To the contrary, surveys regularly show that a significant majority recognise the importance of economic and financial issues to their everyday lives.  Around 80-90% say they would like economic and financial issues to be covered more comprehensively in the school curriculum.2  It would be wrong, however, to think that public engagement only benefits the public.  Just as important are the improvements to policymakers’ understanding of everyday economic issues.  There is now a wide body of evidence, drawn from a wide variety of settings, on the benefits of combining the insights from expert and non-expert sources when making sense of a complex world, when forecasting an uncertain future.3  Harvesting insights from a non-expert audience appears, in these uncertain settings, to be especially valuable by providing diverse perspectives and different insights.  If we turn from understanding to trust, the picture has many similarities.  Trust lies at the heart of the social contract between institutions and societies, between policymakers and citizens.  But the very nature of trust appears to have changed rather fundamentally over the recent past.  Societies and individuals have undergone what Rachel Botsman in her recent book calls a “trust shift”.4  Where once trust was institutionalised and anonymised, today it is socialised and personalised.    This shift in the gears of trust has had consequences.  Public institutions of all stripes have been one of the casualties, with measured trust having fallen steadily over the recent past.5  Most central banks have not escaped these shifting sands, in particular since the global financial crisis.  For them and us, the age of innocence, or at least the era of taking public trust as given, may be over.    That matters.  Credibility and trust are the secret sauce of central banking.  They are what enable them to shape expectations in ways which stabilise the economy and financial system.  An economy or financial system without trust, history tells us, ceases to be a system.  An economic or financial policymaker without credibility, history tells us, ceases to be a functioning policymaker.  Removal of the veil, breaches of the social contract, leaves the economy and financial system vulnerable.  There is no single measure, nor quick fix, for closing these twin deficits with the general public.  The supply chain for secret sauce, of building and restoring trust and understanding, is long and arduous.  Nonetheless, it seems clear that increased engagement between policymakers and wider society is a necessary ingredient for its manufacture.  From other spheres, such as medicine, we know that trust and understanding are built on everyday engagement.  For the Bank of England, with the scars of the financial crisis still healing, the case for continuing to build those foundations is strong.                                                            2  Haldane (2017a).  The RSA call these benefits improved “agency” among citizens. 3  Tetlock and Gardner (2016).  The RSA call these benefits improved “efficacy” of policymaking. 4  Botsman (2017). 5  See, for example, the Edelman Trust Barometer.  The RSA call these benefits improved “legitimacy” of policymaking. 
   All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 4  4   The Means  If the case is strong, how best is this citizen engagement to be achieved?  The RSA report provides a nice framework for addressing this question.  This is based on the “ladder of participation” model, devised originally by Sherry Arnstein in the late 1960s.6  The rungs of the engagement ladder are, in ascending order:  inform;  consult;  involve;  collaborate;  and empower.  As we move up the ladder, we increase the degree of citizen engagement in decisions that affect them.  The RSA stop short of recommending the top rung, but do propose various initiatives to increase citizen involvement and collaboration.  Armed with this framework, I have been thinking about how far the Bank of England has so far climbed the citizen engagement ladder.  Truth be told, I suspect for the first 300 years of its life, the Bank of England scarcely had its foot on the first rung.  It saw little need even to inform the wider public about the economy and policy.  Trust among the public was anonymised, institutionalised and given.  When tempted to step up a rung, the Bank quickly contracted an acute form of vertigo.  Over the past 25 years the Bank has taken significant steps up the engagement ladder, in part in response to the public’s trust shift, in part reflecting the Bank’s wider policy responsibilities.  These steps have transformed how the Bank “informs” and “consults” the public on its views and policies.7  One simple diagnostic is the rise in the Bank’s publication count.  Seventy years ago, the Bank published precisely one speech a year.  Today, rarely a day passes without multiple publications.  Then, the Bank uttered publically fewer than 5,000 words per year.  Last year, it uttered in excess of 4 ½ million.    Over the past two decades, it would not be an exaggeration to say there has been a genuine revolution in central bank communications.  Perhaps even more importantly, there has been a revolution in central bank attitudes towards public engagement.  This revolution has, with luck, increased the public’s understanding of the economy and economic policy.  But there is no question in my mind that it has also enhanced very significantly central banks’ own understanding of the economy.  Having ascended some rungs of the engagement ladder, our panorama on the economy has been much enhanced.   Looking back over the past five years, and looking forward to the next five, the Bank is taking further steps towards securing a foothold on the next rungs of the engagement ladder.  This will increase the extent to which we “involve” and “collaborate” with a wider set of citizens, as well as “informing” and “consulting” them.  From a potentially long list, let me highlight four examples of how we are going about that.                                                           6  Arnstein (1969). 7  Haldane (2017b).  A number of excellent historical examples are given in Kynaston (2017).  
   All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 5  5   (a) Layered Communications  There is a natural temptation among technocrats to communicate in a language that is only understood by fellow technocrats.  This tendency has deep sociological roots, most probably dating back to our  hunter-gatherer past.  At that time, language was a means of bonding and binding people;  it was social glue.  It still is.  Language can also, however, be a barrier to understanding and, as in our hunter-gather past, a source of tribal conflict.  These linguistic barriers apply everywhere and to everyone.  But they seem to be especially troublesome among the economic and financial tribe, which stand out relative to others in their insularity.8     Central bankers are not immune to these primordial tendencies.  They, too, sometimes use the tribal language of technocracy.  And this too can sometimes serve as a barrier to understanding and a blockage to trust.  My “stylised fact” (itself a piece of technical jargon) is that around 95% of all the words central banks utter are inaccessible to around 95% of the population.  (Imagine speaking 4 ½ million words and more than 4 ¼ million of them falling on deaf ears?)  If you conduct a semantic analysis of central bank text, you will find that I have erred on the side of generosity with these fractions.9  When someone says to me “spoken like a true central-banker”, they come to bury Andy not praise him.  But things are changing.  The Bank is making a big effort to simplify and demystify its words and to challenge its ideas and thinking.  The Bank’s staff blog, Bank Underground, is one example of such challenge.  Last year, it recorded its millionth hit.  Recently, the Bank has begun issuing its publications in a “layered” format, to cater for different audiences:  a one-sentence, one-graphic version for the time-poor;  a 60-page  chart-tastic technical text for the masochist.  As best we can tell, this has opened up the Bank’s views to a far-wider audience.  The number of website hits has increased markedly since publication of our first layered Inflation Report in November last year.  Recently, we have tried to pinpoint more precisely the benefits of layered communication in boosting the public’s understanding and trust.  This involved conducting a so-called “randomised control trial” on two groups – a group of experts (students studying economics at university) and a group of non-experts.10  Both groups were randomly split with some given layered, and others un-layered, Bank of England content from the Inflation Report.  This enabled a direct assessment of the impact of layering on understanding and trust.    It would have been a tad disappointing if layering had had no impact.  And thank heavens for small mercies that, for both the expert and non-expert groups, layering boosted reported trust and understanding scores.  What was more interesting was by how much layering seemed to help.  In our sample, the boost to understanding of the economy and monetary policy that came from layering the Inflation Report was larger                                                       8  Haldane and Turrell (2017).   9  Haldane (2017b).   10  Haldane and McMahon (forthcoming). 
   All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 6  6   than the boost to understanding that came from having studied for an advanced degree in economics.  That’s a depressing statistic for those of us who have studied economics, but great news for everyone else.  (b) Educational Programme  A second strand of the Bank’s engagement strategy is education. You could see this initiative as helping to meet citizens’ self-expressed desire for firmer educational foundations on all matters economic and financial.  To help dig the footings of that foundation, the Bank will be visiting around 200 schools this year to give talks and lectures using its newly-enlisted ambassador army, some with the help of our partner, the charity Speakers for Schools.  The Bank also now runs two schools competitions, the most recent announced just last week in partnership with the Financial Times.11    The most significant of the Bank’s educational initiatives will take place in the classroom itself.  We have developed, in conjunction with We Are Futures, classroom materials for use in the Personal, Social, Health and Economics (PSHE) component of the curriculum.  We have involved and consulted teachers in designing and refining these materials.  They will be rolled-out in schools from 27 April.  The Bank would like to see PSHE and, within that, economics become a compulsory part of the curriculum, echoing the views of parents and pupils.  I have recently written to the Department of Education to say that.12  (c) Regional Tours  A third strand is regional engagement.  The Bank has had, for the past 90 years, a network of regional Agencies dotted across the UK.13  They are the Bank’s eyes and ears, playing a key role in collecting intelligence on the economy and financial system, largely from companies.  That intelligence feeds directly into the Bank’s policy deliberations.  Last year alone, the Bank’s Agents met with over 8,000 companies.  Recently, we extended the Agents’ reach to include charities, community groups, trades unions and wider civil society.  On the engagement ladder, these are examples of the Bank “involving” and “collaborating” with citizens, on a practical day-to-day basis across all parts of the UK.    Last year, I extended my own regional programme, with a separate set of visits designed to engage with, and listen to, some of the quieter voices in society, voices otherwise drowned-out in the media cacophony – the voice of charities, community and voluntary groups, local councils, trade unions.  And I have sought out those voices in parts of the country that may not otherwise always get a hearing – the under-performing parts of thriving cities as well as communities, towns and cities which are struggling.  This regional focus on engaging with the less well-performing parts of the UK is in line with another of the RSA’s recommendations.                                                        11  Details available at https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2018/february/boe-and-ft-school-blog-competition 12  See https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2018/february/department-of-education-consultation-response?sf84498143=1 13  England, Hebden, Henderson and Pattie (2015). 
   All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 7  7   These visits use approaches to collecting intelligence which are, for me, new – listening methods more familiar from anthropology and sociology than economics and statistics.  They involve open, unframed discussions of the issues that matter most to people in their everyday lives, their lived experiences in their local communities, with me as a fly (not bluebottle) on the wall.  Some of my findings – in the form of words, photos and cartoons – are available at https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/outreach#.  I find that cartoons can be particularly effective, indeed much better than words, in capturing the sentiment and narrative in the room.  For example, consider this one on what the local community saw as their key challenges and frustrations, taken from my visit to South Wales.    Or this one, on the role of charities in the community from my visit to Leicester.

These pictorial narratives provide a simple visual summary which, unlike the written word, can be digested by anyone in less than a minute.  They are also a very useful cross-check on my own understanding and a check on my own cognitive biases.  Often, I find that the message my non-economist scribe, David, takes from these meetings is different than my own.14  In these situations, I take David’s reading of the room as probably the truer reflection of what citizens have really said.   I call these visits my Townhall Tours, though this is a rubbish description as I have yet to visit a town hall.  I am told that anthropologists would call what I am doing “deep hanging out”, after anthropologist  Clifford Geertz.15  Deep hanging out sounds more appealing than visiting town halls.  Nonetheless, I am not entirely convinced the Bank of England press release which announces “This is Andy deep hanging out in Stoke” will scan.  So I am open to crowd-sourced alternative suggestions.    Let me give one or two concrete examples of how this regional engagement has helped my own understanding of the economy, its hidden corners, its quiet voices.    When UK GDP returned to its pre-crisis peak in 2014 economists told the world the economy had “recovered”.16  Around 30 seconds into a talk about the “recovery” with charities in Nottingham in 2016, I was put straight.  The language of recovery resonated with no-one in the room.  This experience was repeated on TV, some months later during the referendum debate, when a questioner in Newcastle put straight one of the participants on tonight’s panel with the memorable line “That’s your bloody GDP, not ours”.                                                        14  http://www.visualscribing.com/ 15  Geertz (1998), with thanks to Grace Blakeley at the Institute for Public Policy Research. 16  The date that real GDP returned to its pre-crisis peak has changed between different vintages of ONS data and was originally thought to have occurred in 2014.  In the latest vintage of ONS data, it was in 2013. 
   All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 9  9   When I returned to my desk from Nottingham and plotted GDP regionally as well as nationally, something surprising emerged from the numbers.  In fact, GDP had passed its pre-crisis peak in only two regions of the UK – London and the South-East.  No other region in the UK had in fact experienced a “recovery”, whether Nottinghamshire or anywhere else.  My “recovery” narrative, while true at the national level, had rightly fallen on sceptical ears at a regional level.  Although the Bank’s policies only operate at a national level, this is important context for how we and others communicate about the economy.    A second example came when I visited South Wales towards the end of last year.  At the time, inflation was picking up as a result of the fall in the pound after the referendum, taking it above its 2% target.  But this was a modest inflation overshoot by historical standards, with commensurately modest costs.  Or so I thought.  But when people in South Wales described for me its everyday consequences, the costs seemed anything but modest.  Their personal inflation rates were running at closer to 10%.  For some, that made for a stark choice between “heating or eating”.  This made very concrete for me the benefits of the inflation target and monetary policy in supporting people’s everyday lives.  A third example would be the narratives – that word again – I have knitted together from my various regional visits on the structural impediments to growth in communities, towns and cities across the UK.  My deep hanging out has, to date, unearthed, six such impediments – the “big six”.  They are schooling, housing and shopping, finance, jobs and transport.  These are not problems that central banks’ tools can help solve.  But any structural plan for the economy worth its salt needs I think to have a song to sing about each of the big six, not just in London and Leeds, Cardiff and Edinburgh, Belfast and Birmingham, but as importantly in Sunderland and Stoke, Blackpool and Bradford, Boston and Orkney.    (d) Citizens Panels  Last but not least, there is a recommendation in today’s RSA report which is aimed explicitly at the Bank of England.  Building on the RSA’s own project, it is that the Bank set up its own set of regional citizen councils, centred around our Agency network.  The aim is to establish, in a structured, systematic and comprehensive way, a two-way dialogue and collaboration between the Bank and a panel of citizen representatives on the economy, financial system and policy, as a means of enhancing the understanding of both parties.  This is a bold recommendation.  That language would usually preface an official like me lavishing praising on this recommendation, before gently burying it.  But not today.  I am delighted to announce that the Bank intends implementing in full the RSA’s recommendation.  During the course of this year, we will begin the process of setting-up regional citizen councils using our Agency network.  This is a natural next step, and will become a central plank, of the Bank’s engagement strategy in the years ahead.    This is, for the Bank, the next rung in our ascent of the engagement ladder.  I am confident our view of the economy, and our setting of economic policy, will be greatly enhanced by this wider panorama.  It will give 
   All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 10  10   the Bank a new lens on the economy’s hidden corners, a new set of often-quieter voices to listen to and learn from.  It is an example of what the Bank, and I hope others, will be doing much more of over the period ahead:  listening to a much wider audience, digesting their narratives, and then using this information to support the economy and the citizen stakeholders that make it up.

Yves Mersch: Interview with ReutersInterview with Mr Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank,conducted by Mr Balazs Koranyi on 14 March 2018 and published on 16 March 2018.*   *   *Mario Draghi took a cautious view on inflation, arguing that economic slack may bebigger than earlier thought. What is the implication of this unexpected slack?The policies we have undertaken, especially since 2014, have been quite successful in getting uscloser to our inflation aim. But there are uncertainties about the process of inflation, given factorslike globalisation and technological changes. Mario Draghi raised important questions, whichhave been discussed among central bankers: what is the non-accelerating inflation rate ofunemployment (NAIRU), what is the output gap and how big is the slack? He was exploring thepossibility that the degree of slack might be bigger than what you find in classical assessments.We are continuously surprised by the response of the labour market to increasing aggregatedemand of a growing economy because rising demand has been leading to continuous positivesupply reactions in the labour market.ECB staff estimates that the euro area output gap is closed, and there is already a positiveoutput gap in Germany. But there is little inflation. Maybe there is another explanation. Perhapswe are getting a supply of labour that is pushing the frontier out. In Germany we know thatmigration from Central and Eastern European countries with relatively comparable skills ismaking an impact. Without such a labour supply reaction, you would have had wage inflationabout 1 percentage point higher, and as a consequence, higher inflation.Would that mean that the output gap is not yet closed?That is an open question. We are all surprised by the reaction of the labour market to bettereconomic conditions. The increasing participation of women and older people is certainly makingan impact. In term of hours worked, we have not yet recovered the level of 2007. But in terms ofemployment, we have. It seems there is a trend for people to work less or part time.Now we are reaching a floor for unemployment but it’s not so clear if we’re going to see wageincreases and Mario Draghi was opening the conversation on the possibility that there may bemore slack in the economy. That still needs to be confirmed but we already have strong evidenceof a strong labour supply reaction.The survey of professional forecasters indicates that unemployment will fall to 7.5 percent in 5years. It’s not clear if that’s the new NAIRU. Economists have been surprised by the fact that theNAIRU has been continuously revised downwards. The supply of labour has increased morethan expected, so there were reservoirs of labour. It could be migration or longer working hours.It is clear that if you believe that the degree of slack is higher, then the process of convergence tobelow, but close to, 2% over the medium term would be drawn out.We should not draw implications for policy immediately but it shows you the richness of thediscussion at a stage where the economy is booming and we don’t see very strong wageincreases and little pass through to prices.However, we still see improvements in the path of inflation, so the bottom line is not bad at all. Itmeans that the economy may have unexploited potential capacity.If slack is bigger, wouldn’t it mean that the path would be shallower? 1 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
Well, other things being equal, it would be shallower.Another explanation for low wage growth is that there is some backward looking behaviour in thewage-setting mechanism and in inflation expectations. For the time being I take an open view.Monetary policy also plays a role. Our asset purchases programme has a minimum horizon ofend September, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until we see a sustained adjustment ininflation. It is true that when we communicate about what happens beyond September, we wantto have confirmation of data. Things are going in the right direction but there are a number ofuncertainties. So the message is patience, persistence and prudence.When do you need to communicate what happens beyond September?It can’t be on the very last day, but I argue that it shouldn’t be too early, either. There are not toomany Governing Council meetings between now and then.Can you see a scenario that you use the June projections to set up the decision and then takethe actual decision in July?The projection exercise is always important. There are four per year and there will be one inJune. It’s true that projections in general are useful to guide and structure the discussion. But Iwould caution against concluding that there is a pattern. We should not put too much weight onthe projections.You mentioned earlier that market expects the first rate hike between the first andsecond quarters of next year. How comfortable with those expectations?The expectation implicit in the forward curve currently fluctuates around April and May. Marketanalysts’ surveys indicate expectations of a slightly delayed lift-off.I don’t want to directly answer this question. But we try to judge if market expectations reflectfundamentals and if market expectations fit with our views. It’s a two way street: we learn frommarkets and markets learn from us.Markets have a certain expectation about the end of the net asset purchase programme (APP).We try to see if this fits with the narrowing between the inflation objective and market indicatorsof inflation expectations. For example, I look at the gap between the objective of below, but closeto, 2% and the 5-year/5-year forward swaps-derived inflation rate, which is now at 1.7 percent.So the gap is narrowing, which is why markets don’t expect us to continue the APP much longer.Market prices seem to be coherent with the narrowing of the gap between market-based inflationexpectations and our objective. It’s a good sign. There is a convergence between marketexpectations and our intended end date, with the optionality.When approaching the end of our net asset purchases, our forward guidance on policy rates willhave to be further specified and calibrated as appropriate to keep inflation on a sustainedadjustment path towards our inflation objective.So what happens afterwards?Our resilience criterion for inflation is not always understood well. It means that for us to stop netasset purchases, we have to be sure that the financial conditions resulting from thatannouncement will not compromise the adjustment path of inflation.This path is by itself conditional on easy financial conditions. And financial conditions are theresult of three instruments: net purchases, re-investments and our forward guidance on theshort-term policy rates. Today we say that our policy rates will stay at their present levels well 2 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
past the horizon of our net asset purchases. This indication is an important conditioning variable– together with net purchases and re-investments – behind the convergence path that we projecttoday. As we move forward in time, as is natural, the relative importance of the three policy toolswill change, and the main tool for shaping the policy stance will become the path of our keyinterest rates and the forward guidance about their likely evolution.Today, by and large, markets quantify the “well past” interval as ‘up to next spring’. But at somepoint that ‘well past’ indication will not be sufficient any longer to give the public enoughinformation about the most likely outlook for our policy.Once you stop net asset purchases the signaling aspect of the APP disappears and youtherefore have to be much more precise about the future path of the short term rates. We willthen have to re-specify our forward guidance on interest rates. Most likely, we will calibrate it asappropriate for inflation to remain on the sustained adjustment path to our inflation aim. So, as inthe past, we will ensure that monetary policy controls the short end of the yield curve.We will proceed at a gradual pace, or a measured pace as Mario Draghi said, in a way that ismost appropriate for inflation convergence – taking into account continued uncertainty about thesize of the output gap and the responsiveness of wages to slack.You said you would have a discussion about revising your guidance in early 2018. Should yourevise the guidance at the same time as you decide what happens beyond September?Indeed, early this year, we have removed the easing bias on our APP. Looking forward, I wouldn’tsay there is a date or a deadline. The fact that the two of us are talking about this now is alreadyvery telling. However, I would not revise the guidance too early, because that could send wrongsignals about the end of our net asset purchases, which in any case are intended to run until theGoverning Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation.When the first rate hike comes, will you only raise the deposit rate until the interest ratecorridor is symmetrical again?I think it is premature to discuss this question. What counts in the markets is the level and theexpected path of the very short term rate at which banks borrow from each other. Because ofsizeable excess liquidity expected to prevail over the coming years, the deposit facility rate is thepolicy rate that can steer those interbank conditions most effectively.Benoît Cœuré argued that given your oversized balance sheet, you can retreat fromasset buys without risking an unwarranted rise in term premia. Do you agree with thisargument?The float – the share of government bonds held by the private sector – has decreased with ourpurchases. The marginal intervention you have when the float is smaller has the potential to havesome bigger effects on prices. But it is a relatively short term consideration. The main argument,and I think it is widely shared, is indeed that the stock becomes very important.But we need to consider that, as the stock ages automatically, there is a ‘duration leak’, if you donothing about reinvestments. That’s where the reinvestment comes in. And we say we willreinvest for an extended period of time. It’s another element that in the future will have to beclarified.Obviously, reinvesting in short term debt has not the same impact on duration as investing inlonger term debt. The Fed tries to be relatively market neutral. That’s something we may wish toclarify in the future.Clearly, we will remain an important participant in the bond market. But we do not dominate the 3 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
market. Markets will continue to play a very strong role. That means our actions are very muchscrutinized.The influence we have on market prices reflect the credibility of our policy, of the central bankand the inflation objective.Is tapering at the end of the programme necessary?Let me start with what I read from markets: markets expect us to avoid cliff effects. I think it is agood illustration of the interaction I mentioned before. It’s again a question about being coherentwith what you say. When you say you have a policy of prudence, because of a number ofuncertainties, what you will do at the end of the program must be coherent with that sort ofcommunication. So people can judge what is coherent with a notion of prudence and couldconclude that we will gradually bring net asset purchases to an end once the Governing Councilsees a sustained adjustment path. I think it is well understood by the market. 4 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
Sabine Lautenschläger: Banking regulation and supervision – youcan't have one without the otherSpeech by Ms Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the European CentralBank and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the European Central Bank, at the 9th AnnualEFR Stakeholder Round Table on &quot;Financial Fragmentation or Integration&quot;, Brussels,22 March 2018.*   *   *The financial crisis showed what can happen when banks are not safe and sound. So the goal isto make banks safe and sound, and avoid future crises.To that end, we have revamped regulation, and we have strengthened supervision. It’s indeedvital to work on both fronts. Without supervisors, rules would have little effect; without rules,supervisors would have no job – or at least no firm basis for doing their job. You can’t have onewithout the other: regulation and supervision need to be aligned.But are they? Let us take a look at the euro area. In 2014, banking supervision was transferredfrom national to European level. And since then, we’ve achieved a lot. However, we could domore, and that brings me to regulation. How European is regulation? Well, it’s true, of course,that there is a single rulebook. But by and large, regulation in Europe remains fragmented to adegree that makes it hard to reap the full benefits of European banking supervision.And the problem starts with the scope of that supervision. Large investment firms and third-country branches are still not covered by it. This situation should be changed to restrictregulatory and supervisory arbitrage. Then there are the options and national discretionscontained in European regulation. Some of them are still exercised differently across the euroarea. It’s up to legislators to harmonise them. The same is true for fit and proper assessments.The rules here are also very diverse. And finally there are the tools for crisis management. Westill have no common approach to such things as insolvency laws and moratoriums. This tooneeds to change. Likewise, the rules for early intervention measures need to be streamlined.All this begs the question: is the banking union living up to its full potential? I would say: it’s not, atleast not yet. But it could if the rules were further harmonised.Now let’s turn to the global level. With Basel III finalised, we have a global set of regulatorystandards. As standards, they are not always detailed and they are not binding, of course. Sothey still need to be transposed into hard law. And this is crucial; the banking sector is global inscope, and the rules that govern it need to reflect that – at least so far as the big banks areconcerned.But as I said just now, rules can only work together with supervision. How effective global rulesare also depends on how supervisors apply them. Supervisors must faithfully apply the ruleswhich transpose the Basel standards. To do so, they need adequate resources and they mustbe shielded from political interference.And there’s more. There is also a strong case for supervisors from around the world to exchangeinformation, to cooperate and to coordinate. This would help to facilitate strong and effectivebanking supervision worldwide.We have done a lot to make banks safer and sounder, both at European and global level. Theimportant thing is that we keep working together – within Europe and around the world.Thank you for your attention. 1 / 1BIS central bankers' speeches
Benoît Cœuré: Financial regulation and innovation - a two-waystreetIntroductory remarks by Mr Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the EuropeanCentral Bank, at a roundtable organised by FinLeap, Berlin, 14 March 2018.*   *   *Let me thank FinLeap for organising this roundtable.It is no surprise that we are having this discussion here in Berlin, which has quietly emerged as aEuropean capital when it comes to fintech. Over 200 fintech companies already call Berlin home,and this number is growing by the day. I hope that this morning’s roundtable can provide aplatform to exchange experiences and stimulate discussion.That central banks take a keen interest in fintechs should not come as a surprise. As evidencedby the Financial Stability Board, crowd funding and peer-to-peer lending have the potential toaffect bank lending services. E-trading and robo-advice may change the way banks provideinvestment management and advisory functions and therefore the way savings are channelled tothe economy. And it is fair to say that the current frontier of innovation falls squarely withincentral banks’ remit – that is, the provision of payment services.The challenge for regulators is to balance the obvious benefits that fintech innovations may havefor growth and welfare with their potential risks. After all, the history of financial innovation islittered with examples that led to early booms, growing unintended consequences, and eventualbusts.The interaction between financial regulation and innovation is a two-way street, however. It is notjust that change in the financial sector will impact the way we do regulation. Regulatory initiativeswill also affect the direction and speed of transformation in the financial sector, with all therepercussions this implies for monetary policy, financial stability and the way firms andhouseholds manage their finances.Pre-emptively drawing in the reins in the name of financial stability could stifle innovation, preventfintechs from developing important economies of scale, and deprive small businesses andhouseholds of the benefit of technological progress.On the other hand, allowing risks to accumulate in an unregulated sector may underminefinancial stability and undo the benefits of past regulatory efforts. Banking services could migrateto less-regulated parts of the financial system unless the provision of similar services with similarrisks is regulated in a similar way. We’ve been here before: decisions taken 20 years ago toleave OTC derivatives largely unchecked created lasting economic damage.And not all financial innovations may provide lasting social benefit. Bitcoin and other blockchain-based digital tokens are a case in point. They are an early sign of what could be a sea change inpayment and settlement technologies, which central banks have started to embrace. But so far,they have been poor imitations of money, risky stores of value, and have often been used asvehicles for illicit purposes.Making our existing payment systems faster and cheaper, particularly for cross-bordertransactions, would likely deliver many of the benefits expected from such tokens. More radicalinnovations, such as central banks issuing their own digital coinage, entail costs and benefitswhich we are carefully considering. The report released earlier this week by the Bank forInternational Settlements sets the scene for these reflections.12345 1 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
New technologies entail new risks. Although risks related to cyberattacks, data theft andbreaches of data integrity are what first spring to mind, regulators also have to understand therisks these technologies pose to the stability of the financial system as a whole. Finding the rightbalance between facilitating innovation and ensuring financial stability and consumer protection isan inherently difficult task. There are no quick or easy solutions.But so far – and I am interested to hear your views on this – I think it is fair to say that theregulatory approach here in Europe has generally been supportive. It is built on the assumptionthat opening up market access to fintech companies will help increase competition, lowercharges and spur innovation, as we have seen happen in other network industries.The fintech action plan recently published by the European Commission is testimony to the EU’spositive attitude towards innovation in the financial sector. It sets the stage for targeted initiativesto address diverging licensing requirements with a view to allowing fintech products andsolutions to be rapidly rolled out across the EU and thereby benefit from the economies of scaleof the Single Market.The action plan also builds on previous significant initiatives, most notably the revision ofEurope’s Payment Services Directive (PSD2), which has already been transposed in 11 EUMember States. The new Directive gives bank customers the right to share their accountinformation with third parties and use them to initiate payments, while maintaining high standardsof personal data and consumer protection. It opens up a level playing field where fintechs cangrow, gain scale and leverage other parallel technical advances, some of them promoted anddeveloped by the ECB.To give just one example, the newly released SEPA instant credit transfer scheme that enablestransfers of up to €15,000 in less than ten seconds will benefit as of November 2018 from theTARGET instant payment settlement (TIPS) service ensuring pan-European reach of instantpayments. With the scheme layer and the clearing and settlement layer in place, it provides agood opportunity for fintechs to build efficient and innovative end-user solutions.The ECB is also investigating the potential of distributed ledger technologies (DLT) in the contextof our real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system. Like other central banks experimenting withthe technology, though, we have come to the interim conclusion that the technology is not yetmature enough.And in our separate role as banking supervisor, we apply a technology-neutral approach thatensures that the use of new technology in the banking sector is not discouraged. We havedeveloped a “Guide to the assessment of fintech bank licence applications”. The purpose of theguide is to make the process more transparent for potential fintech bank applicants and toincrease their understanding of the procedure and criteria applied by the ECB when assessinglicence applications. This initiative is part of a broader effort by European Supervisory Authoritiesto map current authorising and licensing approaches by national authorities and the launch of so-called “fintech facilitators” in several Member States.Just last week we established the Euro Cyber Resilience Board for pan-European financialinfrastructures to create a regular forum to enhance the cyber resilience of financial marketinfrastructures, their critical service providers and the wider EU financial sector. Such effortsare critical in an environment where both the level and scope of cyberattacks are growing rapidly.In this context, I would also be interested in hearing how you ensure cyber “hygiene” and to whatextent information on common cyber threats is exchanged within the wider fintech community.So, overall, fintechs here in Berlin, and in the EU more generally, can thrive in an innovation-friendly environment. But this does not mean that we ignore the risks. Should regulatoryloopholes emerge, we would need to close them to ensure that financial intermediation outside678 2 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches

 Goushi Kataoka Member of the Policy Board Economic Activity, Prices,  and Monetary Policy in Japan  Speech at a Meeting with Business Leaders in Okayama Bank of Japan March 1, 2018 (English translation based on the Japanese original) 
1 I. Developments in Economic Activity and Prices A. Recent Developments and Outlook for Economic Activity at Home and Abroad I would like to start my speech by looking at developments in the global economy affecting Japan's economy. Since the autumn of 2017, improvement in economic sentiment has been noticeable worldwide (Chart 1). The global Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) has shown remarkable improvement for manufacturing activity in particular, and business fixed investment and trade volume have been increasing. One of the factors underlying this improvement in economic sentiment is that, while advanced economies remain robust, there is a cyclical factor of continued moderate recovery in production for the resource and manufacturing sectors, which bottomed out in 2016 amid the waning of concern over a slowdown in emerging economies, especially China. The cultivation of the potential demand by utilizing new technologies -- such as the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and autonomous driving -- also contributes to the improvement to some extent (Chart 2).  Looking at the global economy from the two perspectives of the real GDP growth rate and the inflation rate, developments can be described as follows. Until 2016, the economy remained in a phase where sluggish growth coexisted with low inflation. In 2017, it moved into a phase where an improving trend in the growth rate became evident while the inflation rate remained low. Looking ahead, the global economy is likely to shift to a phase where inflation is clearly accelerated by continued relatively high growth if various downside risks that have been pointed out, such as the following, do not materialize: (1) the risk of monetary policy normalization in the United States and Europe exerting downward pressure on the global economy; (2) the risk of deceleration in the Chinese economy; and (3) geopolitical risks surrounding North Korea and the Middle East. One of the key points for the time being is whether the global economy will reach the phase of rising inflation with high growth that I just mentioned, while avoiding a situation of economies stalling, with major economies beginning to see changes in their monetary policy stances, and if such a phase is achieved, when that will happen.  Next, I would like to turn to developments in Japan's economy. Supported by the moderate growth in the global economy, Japan's real GDP has continued to mark positive growth for 
2 eight consecutive quarters since the first quarter of 2016. The annual real growth rate for 2017 stood at 1.6 percent, the highest level since 2013 (Chart 3). The breakdown by component during this period shows that private business fixed investment and exports are the major driving forces of the growth.  With regard to the outlook, in fiscal 2018, Japan's economy is likely to continue growing at a pace in the range of 1.0-1.5 percent, exceeding its potential (Chart 4). This is because business fixed investment will increase, reflecting improvements in corporate profits and business sentiment, and exports will rise on the back of robust growth in the global economy. These positive developments will then transmit more strongly than before to households through a rise in wages, which will lead to some acceleration in the pace of growth in private consumption. Meanwhile, it is highly likely that the economic growth rate for fiscal 2019 will decrease to the range of 0.5-1.0 percent, reflecting such factors as (1) the effects of the consumption tax hike scheduled in October 2019 and (2) deceleration in business fixed investment due to the peaking out of Olympic Games-related demand.  Now, I would like to talk about the effects of the scheduled consumption tax hike. The hike will have some impact on the GDP growth rates, mainly due to changes in household spending, through the following two major channels: (1) the front-loaded increase and subsequent decline in demand prior to and after the consumption tax hike and (2) the decline in real income. At present, the negative impact of the hike on the projected growth rate for fiscal 2019 is likely to be smaller than that on the rate for fiscal 2014, when the last hike took place. This is because the increase in the consumption tax rate is smaller than that of the most recent tax hike and a reduced tax rate will be applied to some items. In addition, as the consumption tax hike is scheduled to take place in the middle of the fiscal year, there are technical factors; namely, that the front-loaded increase and subsequent decline in demand prior to and after the hike will offset each other during the fiscal year, and a decline in real income could only occur in the second half of the fiscal year.  B. Recent Developments and Outlook for Japan's Prices Next, I will move on to recent price developments in Japan and their outlook.  
3 Looking at recent developments in the consumer price index (CPI), the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI for all items less fresh food for January 2018 was 0.9 percent. However, it should be noted that the contribution of energy items was significant, at 0.5 percentage point, and in terms of the rate of increase for all items less fresh food and energy, which directly reflects domestic supply-demand conditions, the rate only stood at 0.4 percent year-on-year. Although this rate indicates a continued moderate increase, its level is still low, mainly against the background that firms' wage- and price-setting stance remains cautious so far.  As for the outlook, I would like to first take a look at the Bank's baseline scenario. According to the Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (Outlook Report) released in January 2018, inflation expectations are projected to rise as firms' stance gradually shifts toward raising wages and prices with the economy still growing at a pace above its potential and the output gap continuing to improve. It also indicates that, as a consequence, the inflation rate is likely to continue on an uptrend and increase toward 2 percent. With this mechanism operating, the inflation rate -- specifically, in terms of the median of the Policy Board members' forecasts for the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) -- is projected to rise to around 1.8 percent through fiscal 2019, excluding the direct effects of the consumption tax hike (Chart 4).  In contrast to this baseline scenario, I consider that the possibility of the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI increasing to 2 percent through fiscal 2019 is low at this point. This difference in the price outlook reflects the discrepancy in how to view the overall effectiveness of the current monetary easing policy and the functioning of the policy's transmission channels. I will elaborate on this later when I explain the conduct of monetary policy.  II. Conduct of Monetary Policy In what follows, I describe the Bank's monetary policy. I would like to first explain the current framework and then present my views on policy measures necessary for achieving the Bank's price stability target.  
4 In January 2013, the Bank set the price stability target at 2 percent in terms of the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI, and has been aiming at achieving this target at the earliest possible time. The Bank also announced strengthening of policy coordination with the government by releasing a joint statement, and the two entities have been working together to overcome deflation early and achieve sustainable economic growth with price stability. Under these circumstances, the Bank introduced Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) in April 2013. Since September 2016, it has been conducting monetary policy under the framework of QQE with Yield Curve Control. This current framework for monetary policy consists of two major components (Chart 5).1  The first is yield curve control in which the Bank controls short-term and long-term nominal interest rates and thereby encourages a decline in real interest rates -- calculated as nominal interest rates minus expected inflation rates -- so as to achieve highly accommodative financial conditions and stimulate economic activity and prices. The Bank has set the short-term policy interest rate at minus 0.1 percent and the target level of 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) yields at around 0 percent. It conducts purchases of JGBs so as to achieve these targets, thereby encouraging the formation of an optimal shape of the yield curve to achieve the 2 percent price stability target.  The second component is an inflation-overshooting commitment. Under this commitment, the Bank continues expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed CPI (all items less fresh food) exceeds 2 percent and stays above this target level in a stable manner. With this commitment, the Bank aims to increase its credibility among the public that it will achieve the 2 percent price stability target by ruling out the possibility of a change in the direction of monetary policy at an early stage when achievement of the target comes in sight.  In my view, this monetary policy framework will lead to higher inflation, mainly through four transmission channels (Chart 6). The first is highly accommodative financial conditions                                                    1 In addition to the two major components, the Bank conducts purchases of risky assets -- namely, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) -- as part of monetary policy. 
5 -- accompanying declines in real interest rates through declining nominal interest rates and in risk premia -- to bring about an improvement in the output gap. The second is the improvement in the output gap to push up the observed inflation rate. The third is the rise in the observed inflation rate resulting in higher inflation expectations through the adaptive expectation formation mechanism, which further raises the observed inflation rate. And the fourth channel is that the Bank's strong commitment to achieving the 2 percent price stability target will directly raise inflation expectations, prompting a rise in the observed inflation rate in turn.  Earlier, when I described the outlook for prices, I mentioned that the possibility of the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI increasing to 2 percent through fiscal 2019 is low. This is because I still lack confidence that the four transmission channels I have just explained are operating to an effective extent whereby the inflation rate will be pushed up to reach 2 percent, even though more than a year has passed since the Bank's adoption of QQE with Yield Curve Control. Of course, the positive effects of monetary easing are likely to strengthen gradually, given that the improvement in the output gap continues. At this point, however, my view is that the momentum for a rise in inflation is not strong enough to reach 2 percent through fiscal 2019.2  To illustrate this, I plot the relationship of the output gap and the inflation rate on a graph (Chart 7). In the period after the adoption of QQE leading up to the introduction of QQE with Yield Curve Control, the slope of the trend line became somewhat steep and the line's level rose (Chart 7, red line in the left-hand panel) compared with that for an earlier period (black line in the same panel). These developments suggest that ideal changes in the economy had been taking place, implying that the effects through the second channel -- that is, the improvement in the output gap that thereby pushes up the observed inflation rate --                                                    2 For the inflation rate to increase to 2 percent going forward, I consider that it is essential to achieve a widening of the output gap that exceeds 2 percent, as well as a rise in the expected inflation rate that is greater than that observed during 2013 and 2014. This view is based on a projection of price developments derived by (1) estimating the so-called hybrid New Keynesian Phillips curve that takes the expected inflation rate, the observed inflation rate, the output gap, and the consumption tax dummy as explanatory variables and then (2) applying projections of the output gap -- deduced from the forecasts of the majority of the Bank's Policy Board members on real GDP growth -- and the expected inflation rate. 
6 had been enhanced, and that both the third and the fourth channels had begun to operate following a rise in inflation expectations. Taking a look at developments since the October-December quarter of 2016, when the Bank introduced QQE with Yield Curve Control, however, the slope of the trend line has become gradual and the line's level has declined slightly, although these changes should be regarded as being subject to a margin of error due to a limited sample size (Chart 7, green line in the left-hand panel). This suggests the possibility that, although the first channel has been operating, the other three channels have not yet been doing so to their full extent.3  In other words, under the current monetary policy framework, supply-demand conditions are tightening further, but this has not yet affected firms' overall price-setting stance toward raising prices.4 It also should be noted that the rise in inflation expectations remains moderate, partly reflecting the moderate pace of increase in the observed inflation rate. Short-term inflation expectations have increased somewhat, due mainly to the rise in crude oil prices, but they have not recovered to the level seen in the period between mid-2014 and mid-2015, when such expectations shifted from increasing to being flat. Medium- to long-term inflation expectations remain somewhat weak (Chart 8). I would note that the inflation-overshooting commitment was effective in stopping a decline in inflation expectations, but it has not been sufficient to clearly increase inflation expectations.  On the basis of such understanding, I believe that further monetary easing is necessary to achieve the price stability target at an early stage. Specifically, the Bank should purchase JGBs so that yields on JGBs with maturities of 10 years and longer will broadly be lowered further. With a view to reinforcing the inflation-overshooting commitment, the Bank should also add the commitment that, in terms of the medians of the Policy Board members'                                                    3 These facts also can be confirmed from an estimate of the Phillips curve with time-varying parameters (Chart 7, the right-hand panel). 4 The output gap estimated by the Bank's Research and Statistics Department became positive from the October-December quarter of 2016 and has increased further to 1.35 percent in the July-September quarter of 2017. Having said that, a further widening of the output gap is necessary to affect firms' overall price-setting stance toward raising prices, in view of the fact that the average of the output gap was in the range of 2.5-3.0 percent in the past when the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food and energy) exceeded 2 percent on a basis excluding the effects of consumption tax hikes. 
7 forecasts presented in the Outlook Report, if there is a delay in the timing of achieving the price stability target due to domestic factors, the Bank should take additional easing measures.  I would note that a further lowering of yields on JGBs with maturities of 10 years and longer will promote business fixed investment and housing investment to a greater extent from the financial side. This lowering of JGB yields is also expected to have synergy effects with the government's fiscal policy providing tax support for firms that have a positive stance toward making fixed investment and raising wages. These developments will further increase the pace of improvement in the output gap, and thus enhance the dynamism of the rise in the inflation rate through the first and second transmission channels that I explained earlier. Among many options for additional monetary easing measures under yield curve control, the further lowering of yields on JGBs with maturities of 10 years and longer is the best at this point, in my view, considering the balance between positive and negative effects.  Strengthening of the inflation-overshooting commitment aims at increasing the transmission effects of higher inflation expectations on the observed inflation rate -- in other words, increasing the effects through the third and fourth transmission channels. The rise in inflation expectations from 2013 was attributable to the Bank's decision to introduce an inflation targeting policy. It also was attributable to the initiatives taken to achieve the policy; the Bank announced the strengthening of policy coordination with the government by releasing the joint statement, and the two entities have taken concrete actions by implementing flexible fiscal policy and bold monetary policy as well as the growth strategy. In order to influence inflation expectations, it is essential that policy coordination with the government aiming at achieving the price stability target be firmly ensured through both entities' concrete actions. The Bank, for its part, should further promote powerful monetary easing backed by a clear and strong commitment to achieving the price stability target. III. Reason for Importance of Achieving and Maintaining the Price Stability Target As the global economy continues to grow at a moderate pace, the Federal Reserve is on course to raise policy interest rates and the European Central Bank is moving toward an exit from monetary easing. Under such circumstances, there is some speculation, especially 
8 overseas, that Japan's monetary policy might also shift to a tightening in the near future, or might at least make a slight adjustment toward an exit from monetary easing. However, the inflation environment in Japan differs substantially from that in the United States and major countries in Europe. I believe that, in Japan, there is still a long way to go before considering a change in monetary policy stance.  Let me first look at price developments in Japan as well as in the United States, where the policy rate hike is proceeding. Chart 9 compares developments in the inflation rate excluding those of fresh food and energy between Japan and the United States since 1995. The bold black line indicates an inflation rate of 2 percent and the gray bands show recession periods. In the United States, the inflation rate has been more or less at around 2 percent from 1995 to the present. On the other hand, in contrast to the United States, the inflation rate in Japan moved in negative territory for most of the time during the period between the latter half of 1998 and early 2013. In 2013 onward, the inflation rate has turned positive, mainly due to the introduction of QQE, but remains distant from 2 percent.  Such a difference in price developments between Japan and the United States is often compared to the existence or absence of an anchor that stabilizes a ship in the ocean. The inflation rate generally fluctuates with volatilities of and shocks to the macroeconomics and market conditions, such as crude oil price changes. In the United States, however, the inflation rate has returned to close to 2 percent even after major shocks such as the global financial crisis following the failure of Lehman Brothers. This is because people's inflation expectations are firmly fixed, just as a ship is anchored, at around 2 percent.5 In my view, the reason why incremental policy rate hikes have been possible in the United States so far is that inflation expectations are judged to be anchored well. In Japan, on the other hand, firms' and households' mindset has been formed under the prolonged deflationary environment after the mid-1990s, such that economic activity assuming no inflation has                                                    5 For the implications of inflation expectations being anchored, see Ben Bernanke, "Inflation Expectations and Inflation Forecasting: Speech at the Monetary Economics Workshop of the National Bureau of Economic Research Summer Institute, Cambridge, Massachusetts," Federal Reserve Board (July 2007). 
9 become rational. In other words, Japan has lost the anchor for inflation expectations and has been stuck in a deflationary equilibrium.6  The Bank, through its bold monetary easing policy, now aims at shifting the economy from being stuck in a deflationary equilibrium to entering an inflationary equilibrium in which inflation expectations are anchored at around 2 percent. However, as I have explained so far, the improvement in the inflation rate is not enough and still only halfway accomplished. If the direction of monetary policy is changed without deep consideration in such a situation, there is a risk of the economy fully returning to a deflationary equilibrium.  After the introduction of QQE in April 2013, inflation expectations rose steadily toward 2 percent. However, the momentum weakened, stemming from the consumption tax hike and the fall in crude oil prices. Subsequently, a headwind -- that is, a slowdown in emerging economies and instability in global financial markets -- led to sluggishness in inflation expectations. This experience suggests that, at the stage where the 2 percent price stability target is not yet achieved, inflation expectations are susceptible to negative economic shocks and the economy could easily return to a deflationary equilibrium.7  That is the very reason why it is necessary to carefully conduct the current monetary policy by giving full consideration to risks to economic activity and prices.8 Going back to my                                                    6 See James Bullard, "Seven Faces of 'The Peril'," Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Review, vol. 92, no. 5 (2010): 339-52. Based on Japanese and U.S. data for 2002-2010, Bullard discusses the possibility of the U.S. economy at that time falling into a deflationary equilibrium like Japan, and analyzes monetary policy so as to avoid such equilibrium. 7 See Ryan Banerjee and Aaron Mehrotra, "Deflation Expectations," BIS Working Papers, no. 699 (February 2018). The authors found that, by analyzing inflation expectations across 43 economies, expectations become "less well anchored" and are associated with "somewhat higher backward-lookingness" during deflations. 8 In assessing the effects of large-scale monetary policy on the financial system and the functioning of financial intermediation, multiple factors also should be taken into account; for example, (1) effects of developments in lending rates, (2) declines in firms' bankruptcy rates and in banks' credit costs, both resulting from monetary easing, and (3) effects of improvement in asset markets pushing up financial institutions' profits. When making monetary policy decisions, it is necessary to give due consideration to the likelihood that the longer it takes to achieve the price stability target, the more risks to the robustness of the financial system arise. 
10 earlier reference to recent developments and the outlook for economic activity and prices, from the perspective of careful conduct of monetary policy, I believe that the following two points require due attention, particularly with regard to the assessment of economic developments in fiscal 2019.  The first point to be considered is that, since the most recent consumption tax hike in fiscal 2014, a rise in real disposable income has not strongly linked to an increase in real consumption. It should be noted that, if the next consumption tax hike scheduled in October 2019 causes similar effects, improvement in aggregate demand will not make sufficient progress. I also would note the possibility that, if the tax hike takes place when the anchor of inflation expectations is not yet functioning effectively, people's inflation perceptions might change and, mainly due to declines in consumption, inflation expectations might become sluggish again.9 That is, there is a possibility that the tax hike could increase downward pressure on prices through both channels of the output gap and inflation expectations (Chart 10).  The second point is that there is some possibility that risks to developments in overseas economies will materialize by fiscal 2019. If the risks materialize, Japan's economy will slow down to some degree as it loses support from the firm growth in the global economy. In my view, particular attention should be paid to the risk that U.S. monetary policy normalization will put downward pressure on the global economy, as its potential impact on the global economy is larger than that of other risks.                                                     9 As for the impact of the tax hike on the inflation rate and inflation expectations, one possibility is a decline in aggregate demand to push down the observed inflation rate, which will lower inflation expectations in turn. Another possibility is a rise in prices accompanied by the tax hike to raise inflation expectations. Earlier episodes of tax hikes in April 1997 and April 2014 suggested that the inflation rate initially rose following each hike but declined as aggregate demand decreased, thereby causing a fall in inflation expectations. 
11 Following the bursting of the bubble in the 1990s, Japan experienced a prolonged period of economic stagnation aggravated by deflation, described as the "lost two decades."10 Since 2013, the price situation is finally no longer deflationary, owing to the improvement in the environment surrounding firms and households -- such as represented by the employment situation -- in addition to the Bank's implementation of bold monetary easing policy.11 While Japan's economy is still on its way toward achieving and maintaining the price stability target, as I described earlier, it is necessary to augment the momentum of the virtuous cycle that has emerged during the process toward achieving this target, and put an end to the "lost two decades" for good by realizing the target at an early stage. As a member of the Policy Board of the Bank, I will continue to devote the best of my abilities toward achieving and maintaining the price stability target.  Thank you for your attention.                                                    10 For details about Japan's prolonged stagnation, see the following publications: (1) Koichi Hamada, Anil Kashyap, and David Weinstein, Japan's Bubble, Deflation, and Long-term Stagnation (Massachusetts: The MIT Press, 2010); (2) Masazumi Wakatabe, Japan's Great Stagnation and Abenomics: Lessons for the World (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2015); and (3) Kataoka Goushi, Nihon no "Ushinawareta 20-nen": Defure o koeru keizai seisaku ni mukete [Japan's Lost Two Decades: For economic policies to overcome deflation] (Tokyo: Fujiwara-Shoten, 2010). 11 See Adachi Seiji, "2 pāsento no infure mokuhyō wa datō ka" [Is an inflation target of 2 percent appropriate?], Keiki to Saikuru (Japan Association of Business Cycle studies), no. 64, November 2017. Adachi estimates a New Keynesian Phillips curve by adopting the framework of the Logistic Smooth Transition Autoregressive model, on the assumption of two regimes; namely, a "deflationary regime" and an "inflationary regime." Looking at the estimates on the probability of a regime change, the figure for the April-June quarter of 2017 is estimated at 57.8 percent. While this is greater than 50 percent -- the threshold between the "deflationary regime" and the "inflationary regime" -- it suggests that the economy is still distant from 100 percent, a level that would indicate the economy's complete overcoming of deflation.

Sabine Lautenschläger: The banks and the marketSpeech by Ms Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the European CentralBank and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the European Central Bank, at a Lecture at theFlorence School of Banking and Finance, Florence, 15 March 2018.*   *   *Almost ten years ago to the day, the world of finance was shaken by a strong tremor. On 16March 2008, JP Morgan offered to buy the investment bank Bear Stearns. And it was time. BearStearns was in deep trouble: its share price had fallen by two-thirds since the beginning of thatyear; it was bleeding money; and it was basically shut out of the funding market. At the time, thefailure of Bear Sterns was considered a major event. No one knew that the big quake was still tocome.It happened half a year later, on 15 September 2008, when another investment bank failed:Lehman Brothers. It pushed the financial system close to the abyss. Trust evaporated, marketsdried up, and around the globe, banks were sent reeling.All in all, it was the biggest financial crisis in decades. It dragged down the real economy, whichfell into what we now call the Great Recession. In the euro area, economic output went down byalmost 4.5% in 2009, while unemployment jumped by more than a quarter to 9.6%. Three yearslater, it reached 12%. In Italy, for instance, output fell by more than 5% in 2009, whileunemployment peaked at almost 13% in 2014.These figures are alarming, but they tell us little about the people who lost their jobs, their homesand their future. Taking all this suffering into account, the crisis turned into a tragedy.As for its causes, I admit that the story I’ve just told is far too simple. Of course, it was not thefailure of a single investment bank that caused all this mayhem. The full story is much longer andmuch more complex.However, no one can deny that banks played a crucial role. It became obvious that they can posea huge risk to financial stability and the economy. But at the same it’s an inescapable truth thatwe need banks. Or, to be more precise, we need the services they provide.Why we need banksWho does an investor turn to when she needs money to start or expand a business, when sheneeds to hedge risks or wants to acquire another company? Who does a saver turn to when hewants to deposit money? Who does a family turn to when it needs a loan to buy a home? Here inEurope, all of them would most likely turn to a bank. Banks provide a vital service to theeconomy. Without them, the economy would not work.All this leads us to a crucial question: how can we ensure that banks reliably serve the economy?Long taken for granted, this has become the holy grail of banking regulation and supervision.And it has become the ultimate goal of all the relevant reforms that have been undertaken sincethe crisis. And much has been done. We have revamped the global standards for capital andliquidity – Basel III. Rules for banks are now much stronger than they were before. And the sameis true for supervision. Just think of European banking supervision, which was set up in 2014. Allthis will help to make banks more resilient, so that they can reliably serve the economy.But there is one thing which neither rules nor supervisors can do. They cannot prevent each andevery bank from failing. And in my view, we should not even try to. The possibility of failure isinherent to any kind of business, and it is a core element of well-functioning market economies. 1 / 9BIS central bankers' speeches
No, it is not the job of supervisors to keep individual banks alive. We, in particular, must not lowerour standards to cater for the weakest bank. It would also be wrong to assume that each bank,even the weakest, just needs time to sort itself out. It would be wrong to assume that the localeconomy just needs to grow for a few more years for the bank to recover. The result would beweak banks that stagger on, zombie-like, barely able to survive in good times. In short: suchsupervisory forbearance distorts the market and weakens the entire banking system.Supervisors would become part of the problem.Obviously, we shouldn’t overdo it either. If justified, banks should always have reasonable time tocomply with new rules and standards. Think, for instance, of the transitional phases for the Baselframework. But the standards themselves should not be weakened.All this leads us to an interesting conclusion. Obviously, it was a problem that banks failed duringthe crisis. But taking a long-term view, I would argue that it was also a problem that many weakand under-capitalised banks that did not have a viable business model did not fail. They did notfail prior to the crisis – even though they probably should have – and they could not fail during thecrisis either.But not letting banks fail creates some huge problems further down the road. Let’s discuss whybanks should be able to fail, but often were not able to do so.Why banks must be able to fail (but often were not allowed to)Why was it that in the past banks were often not allowed to fail? The answer is simple: the failureof a bank can trigger a financial earthquake.Banks engage in maturity transformation: they accept short-term deposits and make longer-termloans. Banks depend on public trust. If that trust disappears, they may suffer a bank run. And thatcan affect the stability of the whole system. This happens because banks are highlyinterconnected – either directly or indirectly. The failure of one bank may trigger the failure ofother banks.Such contagion can occur by banks being exposed to each other. When a bank defaults on itsdebt, creditor banks suffer direct financial losses. But contagion can also be more subtle. Thefailure of a bank may cause investors and depositors to wonder about the health of other banks.Trust then evaporates and funding sources dry up. Even sound banks might find themselves inthe midst of a liquidity crisis. This is what happened in the financial crisis.Either way, a bank’s failure can infect the entire banking system. And in this respect some banksare considered to be riskier than others. I am talking about banks that are big, complex,interconnected, and which cannot easily be replaced. Their failure can disrupt financial stabilitybig time. Such banks are systemically important. If they fail, the financial system can grind to ahalt. And not only that: the flow of credit stops, investment and consumption stall, and jobs aredestroyed. The social costs can be huge.To prevent all this from happening, governments have repeatedly bailed out systemicallyimportant banks with public money. Even medium-sized banks were bailed out for fear ofcontagion. But the short-term gain of preserving financial stability comes at a great cost in thelong term.The belief that banks would be bailed out whatever the cost created bad incentives. Banks gotused to an implicit and costless government guarantee, which kicked in when things went wrong.Sound and prudent management was often considered less important. Banks could boost theirprofitability by investing in riskier assets. That way, they could reap higher returns, knowing thatthe risks would be borne by others, by taxpayers. 2 / 9BIS central bankers' speeches
And neither shareholders nor investors provided the necessary checks and balances. Theylacked incentives to monitor banks’ risks. They often expected outsized returns, knowing that thebanks would need to take equally outsized risks to earn these returns. But they didn’t care toomuch; investors too lived in a world where profits were gained by the few but losses wereimposed on the many.Funding costs of systemic banks were too low, which allowed them to grow even larger, makingthem “too big to fail”. At the end of the day, banks and their investors had little incentive to act in asustainable and forward-looking manner.So banks must be able to fail for all the reasons I just mentioned.Making banks fail againWhen’s the right time?Against this backdrop, the aim of all the regulatory reforms was not just to make banks moreresilient. They also aimed to make banks fail again. But don’t get me wrong here. Failure is theleast desirable option, of course. Above all, we need healthy and well-functioning banks.But still, sometimes banks do fail. And to ensure that they can do so in an orderly manner, aEuropean resolution mechanism has been devised. It defines the tools and the institutional set-up. It forms the second pillar of the banking union alongside European banking supervision.But again, resolving a bank is just the very last resort. Thus, the new framework becomesapplicable long before a bank fails. It requires banks, for instance, to draw up recovery plans. Inthese plans, the banks set out how they would overcome severe crises using their ownresources.Now, recovery plans are drawn up when the going is good. When times are tough, the newframework offers some more tools, including early intervention measures. Supervisors can usethem if they see that a bank is about to get into trouble. The idea is to be intrusive and to makethe bank officially aware of the supervisor’s serious concerns. This helps to get the bank back ontrack.Early intervention measures can be an important tool to prevent bank failures. In practice,however, it is challenging to use them, for two reasons.First, because they overlap with some of our standard tools. To give you just one example,asking a bank for a capital plan can be either a standard supervisory tool or an early interventionmeasure. This overlap is a challenge as it often prevents us from applying early interventiontools. We are bound to use the least intrusive tool, which is always the standard one. We alwayshave to take into account the costs and benefits of our measures.Assume that the supervisor, as an early intervention measure, asks the bank to draw up a capitalplan. The bank might then be required to disclose this request to the markets as it shows that thesupervisor is seriously concerned. This might erode trust in the bank and, in the worst case,trigger a bank run. This would bring about the very crisis that the supervisor wanted to prevent inthe first place. If an early intervention measure does more harm to the bank than it does good,supervisors might be obliged not to apply the measures.Instead, they could ask for the same thing, but frame it as a standard tool. In that case, the bankwould still have to draw up the capital plan, but would probably not need to disclose the requestto the markets. Hence, the standard supervisory tools can be considered as less intrusive thanthe early intervention tools.So the overlap between the two tools should be removed. There should be a clearly defined set 3 / 9BIS central bankers' speeches
of standard tools and early intervention measures and a clearly defined escalation processleading from one to the other.The second reason why it is challenging to use early intervention measures is because thosemeasures are defined in the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive, or BRRD. And as theBRRD is an EU directive, it has to be transposed into national law. The ECB must thus exerciseits powers based on the national transpositions; and these vary from country to country. Thiscreates uncertainty and inconsistency. What we thus need is a harmonised legal basis fromwhich we can apply early intervention measures.Now, let’s go one step further. Imagine our bank gets into more serious trouble. In this scenario,there is one tool that helps to create a bit of breathing space for the bank and the authorities tosort things out – a moratorium. A moratorium allows the authorities to suspend all the activities ofa bank for a short period of time. In a sense, it freezes time.A moratorium helps to manage a crisis in an orderly manner. It gives the bank and itsshareholders time to find a solution. This is particularly useful during a sudden liquidity crisis.However, there is a practical problem. Moratoriums are not part of the European toolbox. In somecountries they do exist; in others, they don’t. And in any case, they are not harmonised. We needharmonised, short-term moratoriums in all euro area countries.If, for instance, a cross-border bank gets into trouble, the supervisor in that bank’s home countrycan impose a moratorium. But what if the bank has a subsidiary in a country where only a courtcould impose a moratorium? What if the bank has a subsidiary in a country where a moratoriumcannot be imposed at all? This is a serious stumbling block for crisis management at Europeanlevel. This obstacle has to be removed.Let’s return to our bank and assume that nothing helps and that the situation goes from bad toworse. At some point, the bank will have to be declared “failing or likely to fail”, to use a bit ofjargon. This is mostly done by the supervisors, and it is the most intrusive thing we can do.Declaring a bank “failing or likely to fail” has far-reaching consequences. It is a difficult decisionwhich requires a delicate balancing act.As long as there is a reasonable chance of the bank recovering, a “failing or likely to fail” decisionwould put an undue financial burden on the shareholders. But if the decision is put off for toolong, the costs of an imminent failure start to mount up. This would hurt creditors and depositors.In extreme cases, it might even become a threat to financial stability. So, the “failing or likely tofail” decision must neither be taken too early, nor too late. And in any case, it must be taken withgreat care.There are four general cases which call for a “failing or likely to fail” decision. Some of thesecases are quite clear-cut and can be objectively assessed. Others are a bit less clear-cut –particularly when they refer to things that are likely to or might happen in the near future. Thus,there is some room for discretion when determining whether a bank is failing or likely to fail. Afterall, each bank fails in its own way, so each case is different, and each decision needs to accountfor these differences. We need to take all facts into account and assess them case by case, andnot against a single yardstick. In short, we must be proportionate.Imagine a bank breaches capital requirements. Then we have to ask how severe that breach isand whether it might just be temporary. If it’s just a marginal breach which could be healed withina reasonable period of time, it might not be proportionate to declare the bank “failing or likely tofail”.We also need to take into account that a bank depends on the markets. So how do they react? Abank in trouble might quickly lose the trust of the markets. This could lead to a bank run, whichrequires supervisors to act differently. 4 / 9BIS central bankers' speeches
So, to sum up: “failing or likely to fail” decisions are not taken automatically but are based onexpert judgement. At the same time, they have to be taken case by case and in a proportionatemanner. All in all, they are the most difficult decisions a supervisor has to take. And I can assureyou that we do not take them lightly.How to resolve a bankImagine that we have declared a bank failing or likely to fail. What happens next? Well, at thatpoint the resolution authority takes over. In Europe, this is the Single Resolution Board, or SRBfor short.The SRB then has to answer two basic questions. First: are there any measures, private orotherwise, that could restore the viability of the bank? If the answer to this question is “no”, thesecond question is: should the bank be resolved or liquidated?And the answer to this question depends on a number of things. The objective should always beto ensure that the financial system is not disrupted. If the bank performs critical functions, theseneed to be continued one way or another. In addition, measures need to be taken to prevent thebank from “infecting” other banks or the markets in general. And finally, public funds and thebank’s insured depositors, for instance, need to be protected. So, it is crucial to conduct what wecall a “public interest test”.If all these goals can be met by liquidating the bank, then that’s what will happen under nationalinsolvency law. And this is something of a weak spot, because these laws still differ significantlyacross the euro area. A minimum level of harmonisation is thus called for. In particular, thetriggers for “failing or likely to fail” decisions and for liquidations need to be aligned. If they are not,banks that are deemed failing or likely to fail according to European rules might not be deemedas such under national insolvency laws. This is obviously a huge stumbling block to theharmonised treatment of bank failures.If liquidating the bank has the potential to disrupt the financial system and therefore the publicinterest test is positive, the bank will be resolved at the European level instead. The SRB hasvarious tools at its disposal for this and they are laid out in the relevant legislation. All these toolsensure that a bank can fail in an orderly manner without disrupting the financial system. And thisis the overarching goal.Who foots the bill?Ladies and gentlemen, I have talked about the decision to declare that a bank is failing or likely tofail. And I have talked about what happens after such a decision is taken. The next thing I will talkabout is money. Bank failures are costly. So who foots the bill?“Not the taxpayers” is the first and most important answer I can give you. After all, the mainobjective of the new framework is to spare taxpayers. Instead, it should be the owners andcreditors who bear the losses. I have already explained the reasoning behind this. But how doesit work in practice?The first thing to mention is that banks now have to hold more equity than they did before thecrisis. This means that each bank has a larger buffer to absorb losses. And these losses areborne by those who provided the equity, the shareholders. So, higher equity means that theowners of a bank bear a larger share of any losses incurred. At the same time, failure becomesless likely.And if the bank does fail and needs to be resolved, there is the bail-in. The bail-in is one of theSRB’s resolution tools, and it ensures that the burden of failure is indeed borne by the ownersand creditors of a bank. The bail-in establishes what you might call a hierarchy of loss-bearers. 5 / 9BIS central bankers' speeches
First in line are shareholders, followed by holders of subordinated debt, followed by othercreditors.The question is, of course: how much can be bailed in? And the answer is: everything! Well, intheory. In practice, there is a safeguard: the Single Resolution Fund, or SRF. The SRF isfinanced by banks from all 19 euro area countries. It was set up in 2016, and by 2023, it shouldamount to about €55 billion.In a resolution, the SRF can contribute up to 5% of the bank’s balance sheet. But it can only doso after shareholders and creditors have borne losses amounting to at least 8% of the bank’stotal balance sheet. So, shareholders and creditors have to bear a large part of the losses first,and then the banking industry as a whole can step in through the SRF.The basic idea of bail-in is quite clear. But, as is so often the case, the devil is in the detail.However, I will spare you that particular discussion and turn to three more general questionsrelated to bail-ins.A bail-in ensures that losses are borne by the owners and creditors of a bank, by those who tookthe risk and earned the return. So the first question is: what if they were not aware – or were notmade aware – of the risks they were taking? For it is sometimes the case that retail investors areamong those who are bailed in. These are not professional investors but ordinary people whowere trying to build up funds for retirement, for instance. For such people, a bail-in is not just afinancial loss; it is a personal tragedy.We must avoid such tragedies. But we must do so in a way which is in line with the basic idea ofbail-in. And this is as much a question of consumer protection as of financial education. In termsof consumer protection, we need disclosure requirements which are clear and easy tounderstand so that all investors are aware of the risks they are taking. In terms of financialeducation, we must ensure that all investors have a basic understanding of finance, and inparticular of the relationship between risk and return.In both areas, I see a lot of room forimprovement in Europe.And there’s more we can do. We could set a minimum threshold of €100,000 for investing insubordinated debt instruments. This too would help to steer retail investors away from riskyfinancial endeavours. Here, we would need a European approach, of course. If each countrywere to go its own way, the market for the relevant financial instruments would become toofragmented.The ECB welcomes current proposals which foresee the introduction of non-preferred seniordebt instruments and a general depositor preference rule. This would further facilitate bail-ins.The second question is: what happens if the Single Resolution Fund runs out of money? What ifthere’s a major crisis, and the €55 billion is not enough to cover the losses? Well, in such asituation we would need a common European backstop for the SRF. And we need it quickly, andin any case before 2023, which is when the SRF will reach its target volume. European leaderscommitted to this when setting up the SRF, and they should stick to their commitment. Thebackstop could take the form of a direct credit line from the European Stability Mechanism to theSRF. The important thing is that it can provide both solvency and liquidity support.And now to the third and final question: has public support for failing banks really become a thingof the past? “Almost” is the answer to this question. And the rules are now such that any publicsupport for a bank in fact triggers a “failing or likely to fail” decision.There are a few exceptions, however. One of these is known as precautionary recapitalisation. Itallows governments to recapitalise banks using public funds. But the scope for this kind of stateaid is very narrow. 6 / 9BIS central bankers' speeches
First, it is only available to solvent banks.Second, it can only be used to cover capital shortfalls which were identified in the adversescenario of a stress test.And third, it can only be of a precautionary and temporary nature. In other words, it must notbe used to cover losses which the bank has already incurred or is likely to incur.I will highlight just one issue here which relates to the role of the ECB. With regard to the firstcondition, it is up to the ECB to confirm whether the bank in question is solvent. It has somediscretion here, as the European legal framework does not offer a specific definition of solvency.So it is crucial that we have a consistent definition of solvency – a definition that not just covers apoint in time but takes a forward-looking perspective. Even if a bank is solvent today, it might notbe so in the near future.In the end, it is the European Commission that grants or denies permission for precautionaryrecapitalisation, as state aid rules apply. Among other things, this entails burden-sharing.Shareholders, as well as holders of hybrid and subordinated debt, must contribute to reducingthe capital shortfall. This ensures that the burden of failure is still borne by those who took therisk and reaped the return.Spotting problems and keeping them from mounting upGiven the limited time we have, I have given you a very brief overview of what resolving a bankentails. It is a gruesome and complex event, and one which is best avoided, but not at all costs.To avoid failure, banks and supervisors must spot problems early on and address them quickly.Since the crisis, stress tests have become an important tool for helping us to do this. Stresstests basically assess how banks would fare in various hypothetical scenarios involving differentfuture paths for the economy and the financial markets.Usually, there is a baseline scenario, where things develop as expected. And then there is anadverse scenario, where they don’t: inter alia, GDP, unemployment and property prices arestressed two years ahead in this scenario. So you can see that the key idea of a stress test is toassess how banks would cope if the going gets tough; it’s all purely hypothetical, of course.Stress tests allow us to make a consistent assessment. Each bank has to apply the samescenarios and calculate their impact in the same way. This means that the results can becompared across banks.And stress tests provide a glimpse of the bank’s risk management in action. How quickly can itprocess the scenarios and assess their impact on [the state of] the bank? This is importantinformation about the quality of governance. But the main focus of stress tests is on capital. Dothe banks have enough capital to absorb any losses in either scenario? And the crucial questionthat follows is, of course: what if they don’t?Well, let’s take a brief look at the upcoming stress test. This year, the European BankingAuthority, EBA for short, will conduct a stress test involving the largest banks in the EU. This testincludes 37 banks from the euro area which are directly supervised by the ECB. To obtain a fullerpicture, we will, in parallel, stress-test most of the remaining large banks in the euro area, usingthe same scenarios and methods as the EBA.In respect of capital shortfalls, the stress test is not a pass-or-fail exercise. The banks do nothave to meet certain thresholds. Instead, we supervisors will decide on a case-by-case basiswhether banks have a capital shortfall, taking into account their individual risk profiles and theirindividual capital needs. 7 / 9BIS central bankers' speeches
At the end of the day, stress tests may deal with hypothetical scenarios, but their results canhave very real consequences for the banks. They inform the work of supervisors, and they informmarket expectations when the results are published, as they will be in the case of the EBA’sstress test. They are also a moment of truth for the banks.More generally, stress tests help supervisors and banks to spot and remove weak points inbanks’ resilience early on.If this is not done, problems can quickly mount up. A current example are bad loans, or to use amore technical term, non-performing loans, NPLs for short. Banks in the euro area carry a totalof €760 billion in such loans on their balance sheets. And this is an issue.Having large stocks of NPLs on their balance sheets prevents banks from doing their job. Theyhave a hard time financing our economy. ECB internal research has shown that banks with highstocks of NPLs indeed lend less than others.It is thus important that banks resolve their NPLs quickly and decisively. And this is not just forthe sake of the economy and the greater good. Failing to deal with NPLs also hurts the banksthemselves. High levels of NPLs require constant attention. And this takes time and energy. Sogetting rid of NPLs would enable managers and staff to use their time more productively. Theycould improve business models, shore up profits and make their bank more resilient.So, failing to deal with NPLs hurts the economy and of course it hurts the banks. That’s why weconsider NPLs a top priority. Getting rid of NPLs by restructuring, working out or selling themrequires a joint effort by banks, politicians and supervisors. Banks have to put in place the rightstrategies and execute them. Politicians have to improve the judicial and legal systems to allow aswift resolution of NPLs.And we supervisors? Well, last year we published guidance on how to deal with NPLs. On thebasis of that guidance, we scrutinise the banks’ strategies and provide feedback. So we arekeeping a close eye on how banks are addressing the problem.And today, we have published an addendum to our guidance. This addendum will help to ensurethat NPLs remain a problem of the past once they have been dealt with. To that end, it lays outhow we expect banks to provision for new NPLs. More specifically, it refers to exposures that arenewly classified as non-performing as of 1 April 2018. The addendum is not a binding document,but it specifies our expectations and will thus serve as a starting point for our dialogue with eachbank.ConclusionLadies and gentlemen,Rest assured that I have not exhausted the topic of my speech. But I may well have exhaustedyou. So I will conclude quickly and painlessly.First, banks are important for the economy, particularly here in Europe. That said, it might begood to add a bit more capital market to the mix; but that is a topic for another day.Second, banks must be able to fail. If they are not, the economy will suffer in the long run.But if banks fail, they must do so in an orderly manner. If not, financial stability will suffer in theshort run. The new European resolution framework helps to make orderly failure possible.Third, failure is the least desirable outcome, of course. We need banks which are profitable andresilient in the first place. Stronger regulation and supervision can do their bit. In the end,however, it is up to the banks themselves to ensure they lead long and healthy lives. 8 / 9BIS central bankers' speeches

Germany and Japan — A Central Banker's Perspective on their Past and Future Relationship Speech at the Dinner meeting hosted by Deutsche Bundesbank Regional Office in Berlin and Brandenburg  Bank of Japan January 9, 2018 Hiroshi Nakaso Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan 
 1 Introduction Vielen Dank für Ihre sehr freundlichen Worte. Es ist mir eine große Freude und Ehre, hier heute im schönen Berlin und Brandenburg vor Ihnen sprechen zu dürfen! Ich würde mir wünschen, meine Ansprache weiter auf Deutsch halten zu können. Um Ihnen aber meine Gedanken besser vermitteln zu können, werde ich nun auf Englisch fortfahren. (Thank you very much for your kind words. It is my pleasure and honor to speak to you here today in the beautiful city of Berlin and Brandenburg. I wish I could go on with the speech in German. But in order to better convey my thoughts to you, I will now continue in English.)  I. Relationship between Germany and Japan Germany and Japan have a longstanding diplomatic relationship of more than 150 years. I think the phrase that best describes this is Ferne Gefährten (distant companions). This is because we have many things in common, although our countries are geographically distant. The diligence of our populations has overcome limitations of natural resources, transforming our two countries into economic powers. Today, the labels ''made in Germany'' and ''made in Japan'' are a guarantee of quality and excellence. And as mature economies, we face similar challenges in the future, with societal aging being one example.  The central banks of Germany and Japan also developed a friendship over the years. The Bank of Japan established an office in Frankfurt am Main in 1956. The Bundesbank opened its Tokyo office in 1987, as the only overseas office besides New York. In 2012, the role of the Tokyo office was expanded to include foreign exchange reserve management. The history of our bilateral relationship traces back to the time of the Reichsbank and the Bank deutscher Länder. In this context, let me tell you an extraordinary story involving a former governor of the Bank of Japan.  II. Mr. Mayekawa's Extraordinary Experience In the very early part of my career at the Bank of Japan, I worked for Mr. Haruo Mayekawa. He was a legendary central banker who served as the 24th Governor of the Bank of Japan, from 1979-84. He passed away in 1989 but is still remembered as the man who brought the Bank of Japan back into the international central banking community during the post-war era. His long international experience, which dated back to the prewar period, won the trust of his fellow central bankers. In October 1988, I had a chance to dine with Mr. Mayekawa 
 2 and his wife at a traditional German restaurant in Berlin. He was invited as a special guest to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Annual Meeting held here in Berlin that year. Over a good wine, he became a little more eloquent than usual and started to tell us the following story.  Berlin was a special place, he began. The Bank of Japan, after its foundation in 1882, had established several overseas offices. In 1941, Mr. Mayekawa was assigned to the Bank of Japan's Rome Office. World War II had broken out. After the surrender of Italy, he moved to the Bank of Japan's Berlin Office, where he stayed until the final days of the war in Europe. He described to us what life was like in the bunkers of Berlin in those days. Then, after the fall of Berlin, he fled via the Siberian Railway to Manchuria, a part of China under Japanese control at the time. From there he took a ship back to Japan. Had he decided to remain in Manchuria, he might have been caught up in the military offensive by the Soviet Union following its declaration of war on Japan in August 1945. When Mr. Mayekawa finally returned home and stood in his doorway, Mrs. Mayekawa told us, she was so surprised that she first looked to see whether he had feet -- because in Japan it is thought that ghosts do not have feet. She had assumed he was no longer alive, because he had been reported missing. Mr. Mayekawa is probably the only governor in the history of central banking who experienced three unconditional surrenders in wartime; in Italy, Germany, and then in Japan. At the restaurant, looking at the colorful and prosperous lights of the Kurfürstendamm, he concluded his story by telling us how much he cherished peace and how much he thought sound economic development mattered.  Let me add that for me, too, personally, Germany is a very familiar place. As a young boy in the late 1960s, I was brought up in beautiful Hansestadt Hamburg. It was during this period that my father took me to West Berlin for the first time. My second visit was in 1988, when, as I mentioned, the IMF held an annual meeting in West Berlin and I attended the Japanese delegation. So, this is my third visit. But this visit is very special as it is my first one to the capital city of the united Germany.  III. Origins of Japan's Economic Ordeal The two central banks, the Bundesbank and the Bank of Japan, have had the reputation as tough inflation fighters. However, the policy priority started to diverge in the 1990s. Our 
 3 mission became focused on ending deflation and bringing Japan's economy back on track to sustained growth. This is the topic that I now want to talk about. Let me begin with the background to the difficulties that Japan has faced.  I think the root cause of Japan's economic ordeal is the bursting of asset bubbles in the early 1990s. Slide 1 looks at the magnitude of the bursting of asset bubbles. As you see in the left panel, the cumulative capital gains during the bubble years in Japan amounted to more than 450 percent of nominal GDP. The bursting of the bubble resulted in a brutally large swing in the opposite direction, with the cumulative capital losses equivalent to almost minus 230 percent of nominal GDP. In the United States, which was the epicenter of the Global Financial Crisis, the corresponding numbers were 300 percent and minus 100 percent, respectively. In both cases, the economic impacts were destructive.  In Japan's case, the toll was almost exclusively on the banking sector, which often had been compared to the Invincible Armada during the bubble era. Slide 2 shows the cumulative credit losses experienced by Japanese banks. This figure climbed constantly until it reached almost 100 trillion yen, which corresponds to about 20 percent of Japan's nominal GDP. During the decade of Japan's financial crisis, more than 180 financial institutions, including internationally active ones, went under. The banking sector was broken. This meant the loss of the credit intermediary function, which was badly needed at the time to support economic recovery.   When Japan's economy overcame the aftermath of the homegrown financial crisis of the 1990s, it was struck by another major shock, triggered by the U.S. subprime loans problem and accentuated by the collapse of Lehman Brothers: the Global Financial Crisis. The left panel in Slide 3 shows that the parallel shift of GDP to the downside took place in Japan. This also was the case for other major economies, including the U.S. economy. Although the GDP recovered to pre-crisis levels, for reasons we do not precisely know, it has not returned to the original trends in the Japanese economy and many other advanced economies. On the contrary, the German economy, which you see in the right panel, was exceptional in that it reverted to the original trend rather quickly with higher growth rates. The difference may be an interesting topic to be further explored.   
 4 Therefore, the financial crisis was the root cause for Japan's ordeal. But the country's problem was compounded by other factors; namely, deflation and demography. Slide 4 shows Japan's potential growth rate with a solid red line and its determinants in bars of different colors. The protracted period of deflation that lasted for almost 15 years after the homegrown financial crisis in the 1990s prevented firms from investing in capital, and capital input remained sluggish because the corporate strategy under deflation was to sit on cash. Meanwhile, labor input has negatively contributed since the 1990s as a result of the shift in demographics. This has much to do with Japan's aging society, where the birth rates remained low and the baby boomers reached their retirement age.   As the solid red line in the graph shows, the potential growth rate in Japan has been on a declining trend, coming down from around 4 percent in the late 1980s to almost 0 percent before bouncing back to 0.8 percent recently. What this chart implies is that, in order to elevate Japan's potential growth rate, we need to raise all three determinants: total factor productivity (TFP), labor input, and capital input. Another way of expressing this is that we need to raise labor productivity and labor input in order to elevate Japan's potential growth rate.   Slide 5 provides a decomposition of Japan's GDP growth rates into labor productivity growth and rate of change in the number of employed persons. It is quite obvious from the chart that the decline in labor force forecast for the next decades must be more than offset by improvement in labor productivity if the Japanese economy is to maintain positive growth. What this chart suggests is that, for a country like Japan, or any country with a shrinking population, improving labor productivity is the number one policy priority.   An interesting question in this regard is how Japan's situation compares with Germany, the economy of which is known to face similar demographic challenges sooner or later. Slide 6 compares the economic performances of Japan and Germany over the last decade, from 2006 through 2016, and the contributing factors. The average annual economic growth rate in Germany was 1.5 percent, which was more than twice as high as Japan's growth rate of 0.6 percent during the same period. The improvement in labor productivity was more or less equivalent in both economies. The major difference appears to be in terms of labor input. While labor input declined in Japan, it has shown positive growth in Germany. 
 5  Slide 7 shows why this is the case. While the hours worked by an employed person declined in both economies, falls in the unemployment rate and increases in the labor force participation rate have been more pronounced in Germany than in Japan as far as this period is concerned. But challenges lie ahead for both economies. The right panel in Slide 8 shows that Japan has already turned into what is called a "population onus society," in which the working age population declined at a faster pace than the total population. As the left panel suggests, this is forecast to be followed by Germany, albeit in a less conspicuous manner, in the coming decades.   The decline in the working age population may be partially offset by an increase in the number of foreign workers. This seems to typically have been the case with Germany, which you see in the panel of Slide 9. Even for Japan, the number of foreign workers has climbed in recent years by more than one million against the backdrop of an acute labor shortage.    Even if a decline in the working age population is inevitable, the negative impact on labor input can be mitigated by raising labor participation rates. In this regard, Japan has made tangible achievements in recent years. Slide 10 offers an international comparison of labor force participation rates. The lower left panel shows Japan's labor participation rate for women by age group over the past two decades. You see that more women in the age group of 25-34 years (typically young working mothers) work today than ever before, offsetting the overall decline in the working age population. The labor participation rate for this age group has climbed to 77 percent in 2016, and as a result, the notorious M-shaped curve largely has been corrected. An international comparison shown in the lower right panel reveals that Japan's participation rates for women in 2016 are generally higher than in the United States, although not as high as in Germany or Sweden.  Thus, of the two supply-side determinants of economic growth, labor input can be upheld by raising labor participation rates. What about the other determinant, labor productivity? Slide 11 provides us with some insight. The left panel compares the level of labor productivity in the G7 countries. If you place the U.S. productivity level as the benchmark at 100, Japan's productivity level is around 70 percent of the U.S. level. The German 
 6 productivity level stands highest in the G7 economies. Thus, for Japan to catch up to the U.S. productivity level, it has to close a gap that amounts to 30 percent. As a matter of fact, the right panel shows that Japan achieved one of the highest productivity growth rates among the G7 countries between 2000 and 2015. This suggests that there does remain room to catch up, and it is actually catching up. We know that our manufacturing companies are competitive on a global standard. So, it is mainly the services industries that need to accelerate their catch-up process, possibly through a wider use of information and communication technologies.  IV. Bank of Japan's Monetary Policy Now let me talk about the monetary policy. The Bank of Japan did not just sit by and watch Japan's economic difficulties. In fact, as the nation's central bank, we went through an all-out struggle. Slide 12 shows that the problem with Japan was that the policy rate had reached 0 percent in the early 2000s long before other central banks in the major economies faced the same problem. This meant that there was no room for the Bank of Japan to reduce the short-term policy rate. Japan was faced with the zero-lower bound ahead of other industrialized economies.   When room for further policy rate cuts was exhausted, we introduced a number of new monetary policy measures that are described today as unconventional monetary policies. The Bank of Japan originated quantitative easing and was the first to employ forward guidance. We have literally been an inventor of various sorts of new forms of monetary policies. The latest version of such new policies is called Yield Curve Control (YCC). Slide 13 shows the outline of the policy. It intends to facilitate the formation and thus the shape of a yield curve that is considered most appropriate for maintaining the momentum toward achieving the price stability target of 2 percent.   Under YCC, the operational target is the interest rate. The novelty is that we have two target rates. The short-term policy interest rate is set at minus 0.1 percent and the target level of the 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) yields at around 0 percent. We are buying a necessary and sufficient quantity of JGBs to maintain the rate targets. I think the policy has been quite effective. The left panel in Slide 14 shows that Japan's yield curve generally stays lower than those in the United States and Germany. A comparison with the German 
 7 yield curve reveals that, while shorter rates are lower in Germany, long-term rates are kept lower in Japan than in Germany. The right panel compares 10-year bond yields in the major economies. While the U.S. Treasury rates moved up after the presidential election in November 2016, dragging the German Bunds rates in the same direction, the JGB yields remained at lower levels under YCC.  I now turn to economic and inflation development in Japan to show that the monetary policy has worked quite effectively. Slide 15 provides the Bank of Japan's latest economic and inflation outlook. As you see in the table, Japan's economy is forecast to grow 1.9 percent in fiscal 2017 and 1.4 percent in fiscal 2018. This is well above Japan's potential growth rate, which is estimated to be around 0.8 percent. Therefore, the output gap is expected to improve further into positive territory. This is supposed to exert upward pressure on prices. However, on the inflation front, consumer price index (CPI) inflation rates remain weak and are only expected to reach 1.8 percent in fiscal 2019, still falling short of the price stability target of 2 percent.    In the meantime, the economy has never been better balanced in the recent past. As we see in the left panel of Slide 16, corporate profits have climbed to record high levels. The labor market is very tight with the unemployment rate, shown in the middle panel, all the way down to 2.7 percent, which implies full employment. Meanwhile, job opening rates, as shown in the right panel, rose to historically high levels. So, the question is why the prices are so weak when the macroeconomic fundamentals are so favorable. As a matter of fact, this may be a common question to be asked of the economies of the United States and the Euro area.  My answer to the question in Japan is that, against the backdrop of acute labor shortage, corporate firms in Japan are trying to absorb wage cost pressures without passing them on to sales prices, through such measures as labor-saving capital expenditure, and streamlining their business processes, by doing away with excessive or unnecessary services. In both cases, labor productivity improves and exerts downward pressure on inflation. As a matter of fact, as you see in the left panel of Slide 17, a macroeconomic perspective tells us that labor productivity is on a steady upward trend recently, while real wages are moving almost sideways. Thus, the gap between them, which we label the real wage gap, has declined, as 
 8 you see in the right panel. This means that real wage increases have not caught up with improvements in labor productivity.   In sum, I think weak inflation in Japan has to do with higher productivity, which can be regarded as a supply-side shock. Assuming that wages eventually catch up with labor productivity improvement and the wage gap reverts to zero over time, we can expect inflation rates to pick up accordingly. I think it is a matter of time before we start to witness inflationary pressures gather momentum. To the extent that good things are happening to the economy, I think we do not need to be overly frustrated about the low inflation. We can be patient and continue with the current monetary policy without any further easing.  V. Lessons from the Japanese Experience What lessons, if any, does the Japanese experience have for the Euro area, which now faces similar challenges ranging from low inflation to demographics? I wish I could offer you a full answer, but our own mission to overcome deflation and bring the economy back on track toward sustained growth is not fully completed. So, what I'll offer here are three interim suggestions.   First, you definitely need to avoid a financial crisis. We have learned that a financial crisis inflicts lasting damage on the economy. Therefore, it is essential that the soundness of the financial system is maintained through adequate regulation and supervision. It is just as important to have an operational safety net, including a deposit insurance system and resolution framework that prevents a failure of a financial institution from developing into a systemic crisis. In this regard, the completion of the Basel III regulatory reforms that began following the onset of the global financial crisis is a significant achievement.   Second, monetary policy alone cannot achieve the ultimate goal of overcoming deflation and bringing the economy back on track to sustained growth. Monetary policy must be pursued in tandem with the growth strategy, or structural policies more broadly. Monetary easing raises potential GDP through an increase in the capital stock as well as labor input, thus affecting the supply side. Moreover, accommodative monetary conditions should mitigate any frictional costs that might otherwise accompany the necessary structural reforms. What we in Japan and the Euro area have in our hands is a golden opportunity to 
 9 upgrade our economies. We should not miss this chance to promote much needed structural reforms.  Third, the central bank needs to maintain its credentials as a deflation fighter as much as an inflation fighter by showing a clear and unequivocal commitment to battle deflation. Should this be lost, our experience suggests that the credentials would be extremely difficult to recover.   I am sure that the policy makers in the Euro area, including the Bundesbank, recognize precisely these points and therefore require no advice from me. The cumulative wisdom we have built up over the years in addressing the challenges should collectively and fully be utilized in guiding our economies in the right direction.   Closing Remarks One summer day in the late 1960s, when I lived in Hamburg, my father drove me to the border of what was then the Deutsche Demokratische Republik (DDR). At the border in the middle of a meadow, a Bundeswehr border guard approached me and said ''Look boy, also beyond here is Germany—auch drüben ist Deutschland.'' What Germany has achieved since then is a truly admirable Wirtschaftswunder (economic wonder). I understand it has embarked on the ''Industrie 4.0'' initiative to create yet another Wirtschaftswunder.   In the five decades since my boyhood in Germany, the social and economic environments in both countries have changed quite dramatically. Today, an average Japanese person has a life expectancy that is 15 years longer than people did in 1960. An average Japanese worker today works 50 hours less per month compared with 1960. Similarly, in Germany, life expectancy today is 13 years longer and a German worker works 70 hours less compared with 1960. This is a big change for the people in the two countries, whose common virtue used to be diligence in the 1960s. But this is not necessary a bad thing, because people have more time to enjoy life. It also means that we have more time to get to know each other even better.   
 10 I have a father, who is now fully retired and is one of those enjoying longer life. When I visited him over the New Year holiday, he told me he still regularly exchanges updated family history with his alten Kameraden (old comrades) fifty years on since his days in Germany. Old friendship never dies. I now know it is the responsibility of our generation to not just inherit the friendship with Germany, but foster it and pass it on to the generations to come.   Thanks to technological innovation, we can learn a lot more easily about each other's history and culture these days. In addition, traveling has become far easier, enabling ''seeing is believing'' for many people. Thus, I believe the relationship between Germany and Japan is entering a new stage beyond the traditional sphere, where economic and cultural interaction has become an everyday affair, making geographical distance less meaningful. I would like to conclude my speech this evening by expressing my sincere hope that our friendship develops from Ferne Gefährten (distant companions) to what can be called Enge Gefährten (close companions). This concludes my speech this evening.   Ich danke Ihnen für Ihre Aufmerksamkeit. (I thank you for your attention.)

Lael Brainard: Navigating monetary policy as headwinds shift totailwindsSpeech by Ms Lael Brainard, Member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,at the Money Marketeers of New York University, New York City, 6 March 2018.*   *   *I am grateful to John Roberts of the Federal Reserve Board for his assistance in preparing thistext. These remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of theFederal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee. I appreciate the invitation from the Money Marketeers to discuss the path ahead for our economyand monetary policy.Many of the forces that acted as headwinds to U.S. growth and weighed on policy in previousyears are generating tailwinds currently. Today many economies around the world areexperiencing synchronized growth, in contrast to the 2015-16 period when important foreigneconomies experienced adverse shocks and anemic demand. The International Monetary Fundrevised up its outlook for the world economy in January, continuing a recent pattern of upwardrevisions, in contrast to a string of downward revisions in 2015 and 2016. Stronger economiesabroad should increase demand for America’s exports and boost the foreign earnings of U.S.companies.The upward revisions to the foreign economic outlook are also pulling forward expectations ofmonetary policy tightening abroad and contributing to an appreciation of foreign currencies andincreases in U.S. import prices. By contrast, foreign currencies weakened in the earlier period,pushing the dollar higher and U.S. import prices lower. Since the end of 2016, a broad index ofthe exchange value of the dollar has depreciated nearly 8 percent, whereas it appreciated by 25percent from mid-2014 to 2016.In recent quarters, the combination of higher oil prices and robust global demand has beenproviding strong support to business investment—in contrast to the sharp pullback from 2015 to2016. Business spending on fixed investment rose at more than a 6 percent pace in 2017. Thisrise followed two years of weak growth, dragged down by declines in the drilling and miningsector.Financial conditions are currently supportive of economic growth despite the recent choppinessin financial markets and some tightening since the beginning of the year. Various measures ofequity valuations remain elevated relative to historical norms even after recent movements, andcorporate bond spreads remain quite compressed. This compares with the period from mid-2014 through the second half of 2016, when equity prices were flat and the dollar rose steeply.The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago’s National Financial Conditions Index provides a usefulsummary statistic.According to this measure, financial conditions tightened significantly fromthe middle of 2014 to early 2016. By comparison, financial conditions today remain near theaccommodative end of the range since the financial crisis, even with the recent tightening inconditions.The most notable tailwind is the shift in America’s fiscal policy stance from restraint tosubstantial stimulus in an economy close to full employment. In the earlier period, the economyhad just weathered a challenging adjustment to a sharp withdrawal of fiscal support. Today, froma position near full employment, the economy is poised to absorb $1-1/2 trillion in personal andcorporate tax cuts and a $300 billion increase in federal spending. Estimates suggestDecember’s tax legislation could boost the growth rate of real gross domestic product (GDP) asmuch as 1/2 percentage point this year and next. On top of that, the recently agreed-to budget1234 1 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
deal is likely to raise federal spending by around 0.4 percent of GDP in each of the next twoyears.Achieving our inflation objective and sustaining full employmentAlthough the economy is currently around full employment and has been expanding at an above-trend pace, inflation has remained subdued for quite some time. Over the past year, overall PCE(personal consumption expenditures) inflation was 1.7 percent, and core PCE inflation was 1.5percent—not very different from the average level of core inflation over the past five years.The persistence of subdued inflation, despite an unemployment rate that has moved below mostestimates of its natural rate, suggests some risk that underlying inflation may have softened.While transitory factors no doubt played a role in last year’s step-down in core PCE inflation,various empirical analyses conclude that persistent factors are at play in the stubbornly low levelof core inflation. According to a variety of measures, underlying inflation—the slow-moving trendthat exerts a pull on wage and price setting—may be running below levels that are consistentwith the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) 2 percent inflation objective. For example,some survey measures of longer-run inflation expectations are currently lower than they werebefore the financial crisis, as are most estimates based on statistical filters. Inflationcompensation has moved up recently, but is still running somewhat below levels that prevailedbefore the crisis.Thus, it is important for monetary policy to ensure that underlying inflation is re-anchored firmly at2 percent. At the same time, it is important for monetary policy to sustain full employment.It is difficult to know with precision how much slack remains in the labor market. If theunemployment rate were to continue to fall in the coming year at the same pace as in the pastcouple of years, it would reach levels not seen since the late 1960s. On the other hand, theemployment-to-population ratio for prime-age workers remains more than 1 percentage pointbelow its pre-crisis level. If substantially more workers could be drawn into the labor force, itwould be possible for the labor market to firm notably further without generating imbalances. Butit is an open question as to what portion of the prime-age Americans who are out of the laborforce may prove responsive to tight labor market conditions because declining labor forceparticipation among prime-age workers predates the crisis, especially for men. In oneencouraging development, the strong labor market has pulled some discouraged workers backinto the labor force and into productive employment over the past few years. Also encouraging,our Beige Book and workforce surveys indicate that employers are casting a wider net to find jobcandidates and investing more in on-the-job training.Navigating monetary policyAlthough last year we faced a disconnect between the continued strengthening in the labormarket and the step-down in inflation, mounting tailwinds at a time of full employment and above-trend growth tip the balance of considerations in my view. With greater confidence in achievingthe inflation target, continued gradual increases in the federal funds rate are likely to beappropriate.Although experience in other countries suggests it can prove difficult to raise an underlyinginflation trend that has been running below policymakers’ target for several years, strongertailwinds may help re-anchor inflation expectations at the symmetric 2 percent objective. Ofcourse, it is conceivable we could see a mild, temporary overshoot of the inflation target over themedium term. If such a mild, temporary overshoot were to occur, it would likely be consistentwith the symmetry of the FOMC’s target and could help nudge underlying inflation back to ourtarget. Recent research has highlighted the downside risks to inflation and to longer-run inflationexpectations that are posed by the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates, and itsuggests the importance of ensuring underlying inflation does not slip below target in today’s newnormal.5678 2 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
We also seek to sustain full employment, and we will want to be attentive to imbalances thatcould jeopardize this goal. If the unemployment rate continues to decline on the currenttrajectory, it could fall to levels that have been rarely seen over the past five decades. Historically,such episodes have tended to see elevated risks of imbalances, whether in the form of highinflation in earlier decades or of financial imbalances in recent decades. One of the strikingfeatures of the current recovery has been the absence of an acceleration in inflation as theunemployment rate has declined, a development that is consistent with a flat Phillipscurve. Although wage gains have seen some recent improvements, they continue to fall short ofthe pace seen before the financial crisis.However, we do not have extensive experience with an economy at very low unemploymentrates and cannot be sure how it might evolve. In particular, we will want to remain attentive to therisk of financial imbalances. While asset valuations appear to be elevated, overall risks to thefinancial system remain moderate because household borrowing is moderate, risks associatedwith liquidity and maturity transformation have declined, and, importantly, the banking systemappears to be well capitalized. History suggests, however, that a booming economy can leadto a relaxation in lending standards, and the attendant excessive borrowing can complicate thetask of monetary policy. We will need to be vigilant.ConclusionWhat do these considerations imply for the path of monetary policy? Continued gradualincreases in the federal funds rate are likely to remain appropriate to ensure inflation risessustainably to our target and to sustain full employment, keeping in mind that interest ratenormalization is well under way and balance sheet runoff is set to reach its steady-state pacelater this year. Of course, we should be ready to adjust the path of policy in either direction ifdevelopments turn out differently than expected.In many respects, the macro environment today is the mirror image of the environment weconfronted a couple of years ago. In the earlier period, strong headwinds sapped the momentumof the recovery and weighed down the path of policy. Today, with headwinds shifting to tailwinds,the reverse could hold true.ReferencesBlanchard, Olivier (2016). “The U.S. Phillips Curve: Back to the ‘60s? (PDF)” Policy Brief PB16–1.

Guy Debelle: Risk and return in a low rate environmentAddress by Mr Guy Debelle, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, at the FinancialRisk Day 2018, Sydney, 16 March 2018.*   *   *Thanks to Christian Vallence for his input and to Tomas Cokis, David Halperin and PaulHutchinson for the volatility analysis.Today I am going to talk about some issues around risk and return in a low rate environment, inline with the theme of the conference. I am going to highlight questions that strike me as worthasking about the way return and risk are reflected in the current configuration of asset prices. Iwill suggest some considerations worth thinking about in trying to answer those questions fromthe investor side. I will also describe how issuers have adjusted their strategies to availthemselves of the low rate environment.One of the main points I would like to make is that the low interest rate structure underpins manyasset prices. That is, asset prices which might look expensive are more reasonably priced giventhat the rate structure currently is at historically low levels. So in my view, a fundamental questionthat you need to think about as an investor is: will the current rate structure remain at theselevels, or will it return to the higher levels we have seen in the past? If the rate structure remainsnear historic lows, then valuations can persist. But if it rises, then asset valuations need to bereassessed. The second and related question is: what is the risk that such a shift in the ratestructure occurs and am I being adequately compensated for that risk?Low interest ratesI am going to use the rate structure in the US, and particularly the yield on a US 10-year Treasurybond to illustrate the shift in the rate structure (Graph 1). 1 / 14BIS central bankers' speeches
As you are all aware, in the wake of the financial crisis and the sharp decline in global growth andinflation, monetary policy rates round the world were reduced to historically low levels. In anumber of countries (Australia being one notable exception), the policy rate was lowered to itseffective lower bound, which in some cases was even in negative territory.In part reflecting the low level of policy rates and the slow nominal growth post crisis, long-termbond yields also declined to historically low levels. 10-year government bond yields in somecountries, including Germany, Japan and Switzerland have been negative at various times inrecent years. In 2015, over US$14 trillion of sovereign paper had negative yields.For the past decade, the yield structure in the US has been lower than at any time previously. Letme put in context the current excitement about the 10-year yield in the US reaching 3 per cent. Inthe three decades prior to 2007, the low point for the yield was 3.11 per cent.All this goes to say that we have been living in a period of unusually low nominal bond yields. Howlong will this period last?One way to think about this question is to ask whether what we are seeing is the realisation of atail event in the historical distribution of interest rates. While this tail event has now lasted quite along time, if you thought it was a tail event, then you would expect yields to revert back to theirhistorical mean at some point. You also wouldn’t change your assessment of the distribution offuture realisation of interest rates.On the other hand, it might be the case that the yield structure has shifted to a permanently lowerlevel because of (say) secular stagnation resulting in structurally lower growth rates for the majoreconomies for the foreseeable future. If this were the case, you would change your assessmentof future interest rate outcomes.I don’t know the answer to this question, but it has material implications for asset pricing.1 2 / 14BIS central bankers' speeches
As I said earlier, the prices of many assets could be broadly validated if you believe the low ratestructure is here to stay. This is because the lower rate structure means that the rate withwhich you discount expected future returns on your asset is lower and hence the asset price ishigher for any given flow of future earnings.The current constellation of asset prices seems to be based on the view that the global economycan grow strongly, with associated earnings growth, but that strong growth will not lead to anymaterial increase in inflationary pressure.You might want to question how long such a benign conjuncture could last. Current asset pricingsuggests that the (average) expectation of market participants is that it will last for quite a whileyet.It is also worth pointing out that it is possible that a move higher in interest rates occurs alongsidehigher expected (nominal) dividends because of even higher real growth. If this were to occur itwould not necessarily imply that asset prices have to adjust. It would depend upon the relativemovements in earnings expectations and interest rates; that is, the numerator and denominatorin the asset price calculation.How might we know whether the distribution of interest rates has shifted? One can think of theinterest rate distribution as being anchored by the neutral rate of interest. I talked about this in theAustralian context last year. As I said then, empirically the neutral rate of interest is difficult toestimate. It is even harder to forecast. The factors which affect it are often slow moving. Butsometimes they aren’t, most notably around the time of the onset of the financial crisis in 2007–08, when estimates of the neutral rate declined rapidly and significantly. Currently, there is adebate in the US as to whether the neutral rate of interest has bottomed and is shifting up. Thisraises the question as to the degree and speed with which such a movement in the neutral ratein the US might translate globally.All of these questions highlight to me the inherent uncertainty about the future evolution of interestrates. One might decide that interest rates are going to continue to remain lower for longer, but Istruggle to see how one can hold that view with any great certainty. Yet there appears to me tobe very little, if any, compensation for this uncertainty in fixed income markets. Most estimates ofthe term premium in the 10-year US Treasuries are around zero, or are even negative (Graph 2).Investors are not receiving any additional compensation for holding an asset with duration.2345 3 / 14BIS central bankers' speeches
That is, one can have different views about the longevity of the current rate structure. But, in partreflecting these different views about longevity as well as the unusual nature of the currentenvironment, there is a significant degree of uncertainty about the future. Yet many financialprices do not obviously offer any compensation for that uncertainty.Low volatilityIt’s not only in the term structure of interest rates where compensation for uncertainty is low.Measures of implied volatility indicate that compensation for uncertainty about the path of manyother financial prices is also low, and has been low for some time. This has been true acrossshort and long time horizons, across countries, including Australia, across asset classes, andacross individual sectors within markets (Graph 3 and 4). I will discuss some of the possibleexplanations for this, drawing on material published in the RBA’s February Statement onMonetary Policy, and also discuss the recent short-lived spike in volatility in equity markets.6 4 / 14BIS central bankers' speeches
  5 / 14BIS central bankers' speeches
Implied volatility is derived from prices of financial options. Just as the term premium measurescompensation for uncertainty about the future path of interest rates, implied volatility reflectsuncertainty about the future price of the asset(s) underlying a financial option. The more certainan investor is of the future value of the underlying asset, or the higher their risk tolerance, thelower the volatility implicit in the option’s price will be.Thus, one interpretation of the recent low level of volatility is that market participants have beenmore confident in their estimates of future outcomes. This is consistent with the observedreduction in the variability of many macroeconomic indicators, such as GDP and inflation, and adecline in the frequency and magnitude of the revisions that analysts have made to theirforecasts of such variables (Graph 5). Given the importance of these variables as inputs into thepricing of financial assets, it’s no surprise that greater investor certainty about their future valueshas in turn given investors more certainty about the future value of asset prices. 6 / 14BIS central bankers' speeches
As you can see from all three graphs, a similar degree of certainty about the future was presentin the mid 2000s, when there was a high degree of confidence that the ‘Great Moderation’ wasgoing to deliver robust growth and low inflation for a number of years to come.Monetary policy is also an important input into the pricing of financial assets, so a reduction in theperceived uncertainty around central bank policy settings may also have contributed to lowfinancial market volatility. Monetary policy settings have been relatively stable in recent years, andwhere central banks have adjusted interest rates or their purchases of assets, these changeshave tended to be gradual and clearly signalled in advance. Central banks have also madegreater use of forward guidance as a policy tool to attempt to provide more certainty about thepath of monetary policy.But while central banks might act gradually and provide this guidance, the market doesn’t have tobelieve the guidance will come to pass. There are any number of instances in the past wherecentral bank forward guidance didn’t come to pass. In my view, it is more important for themarket to have a clear understanding about the central bank’s reaction function. That is, how thecentral bank is likely to adjust the stance of policy as the macroeconomic conjuncture evolves. Ifthat is sufficiently clear, then forward guidance does not obviously have any large additionalbenefit, and runs the risk of just adding noise or sowing confusion.Hence an explanation for the low volatility could be the assumption of a stable macroenvironment together with an understanding of central bank reaction function, rather than the 7 / 14BIS central bankers' speeches
effect of forward guidance per se.The low level of implied volatility could also reflect greater investor willingness to take on financialmarket risk. This is consistent with measures that suggest demand for derivatives which protectagainst uncertainty has declined. It is also consistent with other indicators of increased investorappetite for financial risks, such as the narrowing of credit spreads. This increased risk appetitemay in part reflect the low yield environment of recent years; protection against uncertainty is notcostless, and so detracts from already low returns.There has also been an increased interest in the selling of volatility-linked derivatives by investorsto generate additional returns in the low yield environment in recent years. Effectively, somemarket participants were selling insurance against volatility. They earned the premium incomefrom those buying the insurance whilever volatility remains lower than expected, but they have topay out when volatility rises. In recent years, there was a steady stream of premium income tobe had. (This is even more so if I were a risk neutral seller of insurance to a risk-averse buyer, inwhich case, the expected value of the insurance should be positive.) But the payout, when itcame, was large. I will come back to this shortly in discussing recent developments.This reduced demand for volatility insurance combined with increased supply saw the price fall.Such an extended period of low volatility is not unprecedented, although the recent episode wasamong the longest in several decades (Graph 6). Prolonged periods of low volatility havesometimes been followed by sudden increases in volatility – although generally not to especiallyhigh levels – and a repricing of financial assets. A rise in volatility could be associated with areassessment of economic conditions and expected policy settings, in which case, one mightnot expect the rise to last that long. In contrast, a structural shift higher in volatility requires an 8 / 14BIS central bankers' speeches
increase in uncertainty about future outcomes, rather than simply a reassessment of them. Butjust as I find it puzzling that term premia in fixed income markets have been so low for so long, Isimilarly find it puzzling that measures of volatility do not seem to embody much uncertaintyeither.The recent spike in volatility in early February is interesting in terms of the market dynamics,coming as it did after a prolonged period of low volatility.From around September 2017, there had been a rise in bond yields, most notably in the US, asconfidence about the outlook for the US and global economy continued to improve. This rise inyields accelerated in January 2018, again most notably in the US, in large part in response to thepassage of the fiscal stimulus there. As Graph 7 shows, the rise in Treasury yields in the firstpart of this year reflected both a rise in real yields and compensation for inflation. Thisreassessment of the macroeconomic outlook was also reflected in a reassessment (albeitrelatively small) of the future path of monetary policy in the US. It is also worth noting that the realyield can incorporate any risk premium on the underlying asset. So the recent rise may also be aresult of a change in the assessment of investors about the riskiness of US Treasuries.In light of the reassessment of the macro environment it was somewhat surprising that throughthe month of January, equity prices in the US rose as strongly as they did. As I discussed at theoutset of this speech, I would expect that a shift upwards in the structure of interest rates wouldresult in a repricing of asset prices more generally. In late January, this indeed is what happened:equity prices declined, again most sharply in the US. There was a sharp rise in volatility. Theinitial rise in volatility was exacerbated by the unwinding of a number of products that allowedretail investors (and others) to sell volatility insurance, and the hedging by the institutions that hadoffered those products to their retail customers. Indeed, unwinding is a euphemism as, in somecases, the retail investor lost all of their capital investment. Having seen the legendary Ed7 9 / 14BIS central bankers' speeches
Kuepper and the Aints again last Friday, it’s worth remembering to “Know Your Product”,otherwise it will be “No, Your Product”.What is particularly noteworthy about this episode is how much the rise in volatility, and the largemovements in prices, was confined to equity markets. While volatility rose in other assetclasses, it did not increase to particularly noteworthy levels. For example, there was relativelylittle spillover to emerging markets. This is in stark contrast to similar episodes in the past. Thefact that these products were particularly associated with volatility in US equity prices appears tohave contributed to the limited contagion. Also noteworthy is how short-lived the rise in volatilityhas been (to date). In discussions with market participants, one possible cause of this is that theunwinding of volatility positions has been largely confined to the retail market, which wasrelatively small in size. There does not seem to have been much adjustment in the volatilityexposures of large institutional market participants to date.That said, it is conceivable that this episode gives a foretaste of the sort of market dynamics thatmight occur if there were to be a further rise in yields as the market reassesses the outlook foroutput and, particularly, inflation.Demand and supply dynamicsAnother consideration in thinking about future developments in the yield structure is the balanceof demand and supply in the sovereign debt market. It is often difficult to assess the degree ofinfluence that demand and supply dynamics have on the market. But there are some noteworthydevelopments occurring at the moment that are worth highlighting.Graph 8 shows the net new debt issuance by the governments of the US, the euro area andJapan, and the net purchases of sovereign debt by their respective central banks. It shows thatthe peak net purchases by the official sector occurred in 2016. This happens to coincide with thelow point in sovereign bond yields, but I would not attribute full causation to that. The central bankpurchases are a reaction to the macroeconomic conjuncture at the time which itself has a directinfluence on the yield structure. That said, one of the main aims of the central bank assetpurchases was to reduce the term premium. 10 / 14BIS central bankers' speeches
But in 2018, there is going to be a net supply of sovereign debt to the market from the G3economies for the first time since 2014. This reflects a few different developments. The FederalReserve started the process of reducing the size of its balance sheet last year by not fullyreplacing maturing securities with new purchases. While this is a very gradual process, it is adifferent dynamic from the previous eight years. At the same time, the US Treasury will issueconsiderably more debt than in recent years to finance the US budget deficit, which has grownfrom 2 per cent of GDP in 2015 to over 5 per cent in 2019 as the Trump administrationimplements its sizeable fiscal stimulus.In Europe, the fiscal position is gradually improving, but the ECB has started the process ofscaling back its purchases of sovereign debt, with some expectation these might cease entirelyat the end of the year. In Japan, the Bank of Japan is still undertaking very large purchases ofJapanese Government debt, which are larger even than the sizeable net issuance to fundJapan’s fiscal deficit.Meanwhile, there is no expectation of significant reserve accumulation by central banks orsovereign asset managers, which can often take the form of sovereign debt purchases. Andfinancial institutions, which have been significant accumulators of sovereign bonds in recentyears as they sought to build their liquidity buffers, are not expected to accrue liquid assets to thesame extent again in the foreseeable future.So the net of all of this is that some of the demand/supply dynamics in sovereign bond markets 11 / 14BIS central bankers' speeches
will be different this year from previous years. For a number of years, central banks purchasedduration from the market, but that is in the process of reversing. In that regard, an issue worththinking about is that the central banks don’t manage their duration risk in their bond holdings atall. Nor do they rebalance their portfolios in response to price changes, unlike most otherinvestors whose actions to rebalance their portfolios back to their benchmarks act as astabilising influence.An additional issue worth thinking about is that, through its purchases of mortgage-backedsecurities, the US Federal Reserve removed much of the uncertainty associated with the earlyprepayment of mortgages by homeowners by absorbing the impact of prepayments on thematurity profile of its bond portfolio. Private investors typically hedge this risk, and their hedgingactivity contributes to volatility in interest rates. As the Fed winds down its balance sheet, it isputting this negative convexity risk back in the hands of private investors, and the associatedinterest rate volatility will return to the market.Issuance in a low rate environmentTo date I have been discussing developments in the rate structure from the perspective of theinvestor. But it is also interesting to examine how issuers have responded to the historically lowrate structure.Graph 9 shows that many issuers have responded to the low rate structure, and particularly theabsence of any material term premium, by lengthening the maturity of their debt, aka “termingout”. Moreover, lower interest rates on their new issuance have resulted in the average durationof their debt rising by even more.The first two panels show that is true of most sovereigns. The Australian governments,Commonwealth and State, have proceeded along this path. The Australian Office of FinancialManagement (AOFM) has significantly extended the curve in Australia, by issuing out to a 30-year 12 / 14BIS central bankers' speeches
bond. A number of bonds have been issued well beyond the 10-year maturity, which was thestandard end of the yield curve for a number of years. This has also helped state governments toincrease the maturity of their issuance.One interesting exception to the general tendency to term out their debt is the US Treasury,which is undertaking a sizeable amount of issuance at the short end of the curve.Corporates have also termed out their debt. Some corporates have issued debt with maturitiesas long as 50 years, which is interesting for at least two reasons. Firstly, a 50-year bond starts totake on more equity-like features. Secondly, many corporates don’t even last 50 years.The Australian banks have also availed themselves of the opportunity to term out their funding forrelatively little cost. The recently implemented Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) furtherincentivises them to do this. As my colleague Christopher Kent noted a couple of days ago, theaverage maturity of new issuance of the Australian banks has increased from five years in 2013to six years currently (Graph 10). As with other issuers, this materially reduces rollover risk. Thebanks have been able to issue in size at tenors such as seven or ten years that they historicallyoften thought to be unattainable at any reasonable price.While the low rate structure has often been perceived to be a challenge from the investor point ofview, it has been an opportunity for issuers to reduce their rollover risk by extending debtmaturities.ConclusionThe structure of interest rates globally has been at an historically low level for a number of years.This has reflected the aftermath of the financial crisis and the associated monetary policyresponse. If the global recovery continues to play out as currently anticipated, one would expectthat the monetary stimulus will unwind, which would see at least the short-end of yield curvesrise.8 13 / 14BIS central bankers' speeches
At the same time, there have been factors behind the low structure of interest rates which aredifficult to understand completely and raise questions about its durability. I have discussed someof them here today. In particular, I find it puzzling that there is little compensation for duration inthe rate structure. While there are explanations for why interest rates may remain low for aconsiderable period of time, there is minimal compensation for the uncertainty as to whether ornot this will actually occur. At the same time, equity prices embody a view of the future thatrobust growth can continue without generating a material increase in inflation. Again, there is littlepriced in for the risk that this may not turn out to be true.The ongoing improvement in the global economy, together with the fiscal stimulus in the US hascaused some investors to question these views. If interest rates continue to rise without a similarrise in expectations about future earnings growth, one would expect to see a repricing of otherassets, particularly equity markets. Such a repricing does not necessarily mean a major derailingof the global recovery, indeed it is a consequence of the recovery, but it may have a dampeningeffect.At the same time, we need to be alert for the effect the rise in the interest rate structure has onfinancial market functioning. The recent spike in volatility is one example of this. In my view, thatwas a small example of what could happen following a larger and more sustained shift upwardsin the rate structure. The recent episode was primarily confined to the retail market. The largeinstitutional positions that are predicated on a continuation of the low volatility regime remain inplace. That said, I have expected that volatility would move higher structurally in the past and thishas turned out to be wrong. But I think there is a higher probability of being proven correct thistime.See Kozlowski J, L Veldkamp, V Venkateswaran (2018), ‘The Tail that Keeps the Riskless Rate Low’, availableat , NBER Working Paper No. 24362.One may also want to think about the relatively low level of spreads in a number of fixed income markets, as mycolleague Christopher Kent talked about earlier this week. In some markets (but not all), these spreads areclose to pre-financial crisis levels. See Kent C (2018), ‘Australian Fixed Income Securities in a Low Rate World’,Address to the Debt Capital Markets Summit, Sydney, 14 March.Note this scenario is at odds with a secular stagnation view of the world where future earnings growth would notbe strong.Blanchard OJ (1981), ‘Output, the Stock Market and Interest Rates’, American Economic Review, Vol 71, Issue 1,pp 132–143.Debelle G (2017), ‘Global Influences on Domestic Monetary Policy’, Committee for Economic Development ofAustralia (CEDA) Mid-Year Economic Update, Adelaide, 21 July.To be clear, by the current rate structure, I don’t mean that the yield curve remains literally unchanged but ratherthat short-term rates will evolve in line with the forward rates embedded in the current yield curve.For a discussion of some of the market structure issues, see various posts over recent months under the title of‘People are Worried that People aren’t Worried Enough’ in his Money Stuff blog’, available at , by Matt Levine, aswell as “VIX VapoRubOut’, available at ,”, blog post by Craig Pirrong aka the Streetwise Professor.Kent C (2018), ‘Australian Fixed Income Securities in a Low Rate World’, Address to the Debt Capital MarketsSummit, Sydney, 14 March.12345678 14 / 14BIS central bankers' speeches
Peter Praet: Assessment of quantitative easing and challenges ofpolicy normalisationSpeech by Mr Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at theThe ECB and Its Watchers XIX Conference, organised by the Institute for Monetary and FinancialStability, Frankfurt am Main, 14 March 2018.*   *   *The financial crisis that erupted in 2008 posed unprecedented challenges for central banksacross the world in the pursuit of their statutory mandates.  A main feature of central banks’response to the crisis was the deployment of additional, and in some cases novel, monetarypolicy instruments. One of these instruments was what’s known as “quantitative easing”. In thecase of the euro area, this tool has not been used in isolation, but rather as part of acomprehensive package of complementary measures taken to combat the disinflationary forcesthat intensified in mid-2014.Today I will first look at the impact of our policies on financial conditions and macroeconomicvariables. The correct measure of the efficacy of unconventional monetary policy measures hasbeen the subject of some debate in recent times. In particular, the durability of the imprint thatsuch unconventional policies have left on financial conditions has been called into question.Overall, diverse empirical approaches to quantifying the impact of our package of measuressupport the same conclusion: the actions we took have had a strong and lasting effect on marketconditions, and more importantly, achieved a potent pattern of propagation to the broadeconomy. We cannot yet declare “mission accomplished” on the inflation front, but we havemade substantial progress on the path towards a sustained adjustment in inflation.I will then turn to the key challenge we face as we move towards normalisation. For several yearsnet asset purchases have been the primary instrument for calibrating our monetary policystance. Looking forward, once the Governing Council has assessed that the criteria have beenmet for a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the challenge will be to pivot to a morenormal situation where interest rates and guidance on their likely evolution will once againbecome the primary instrument for adjusting our stance, while ensuring that financial conditionsremain supportive of inflation convergence towards levels of below, but close to, 2% over themedium term.The impact of the ECB’s non-standard measuresBy mid-2014, the euro area economy was facing disinflationary pressures that risked spirallinginto outright deflation. With the deposit facility rate held at zero since July 2012, our ability toprovide the necessary degree of monetary stimulus using conventional policy measures wasvery limited.Under these conditions, the focus of providing monetary accommodation shifted from anapproach based on adjusting the interest rate corridor of our monetary policy framework – whichsteers the very short end of the yield curve – to one that more directly affects the wholeconstellation of interest rates across the yield curve. Specifically, the instruments we haveemployed since June 2014 are negative interest rates on the deposit facility, which provide thefloor of the corridor; a reinforced form of forward guidance on the evolution of the interest ratecorridor in the future; targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs); and the assetpurchase programme (APP).With policy rates at exceptionally low levels, the APP soon became the primary instrument forcalibrating the monetary policy stance. How effective have our asset purchases been in helpingthe ECB to accomplish its statutory objective in the medium term? Answering this question is1 1 / 13BIS central bankers' speeches
inherently difficult because of the complex interaction of our APP with other policy instruments aswell as our evolutionary communication about the purchase programme, through which wesignalled our intention to start buying bonds and, later, to recalibrate the size and duration of ourbond-buying programme in advance. Hence, in assessing the impact of the APP, we must alsotake into account the other policy tools used since mid-2014, because the instruments weredesigned to be complementary and mutually reinforcing.The four instruments that have determined the stance of our monetary policy since mid-2014have been designed to reap the full benefits of their complementarities. Two examples highlightthe role played by complementarities in policy design. First, the negative interest rate policy hassupported the portfolio rebalancing channel of our APP by encouraging banks to lend to the broadeconomy instead of hoarding liquidity. Second, the APP has supported rate forward guidancevia the signalling channel. Generally, asset purchases are thought to provide a strong signal thatpolicy rates will remain low for an extended period of time. For the ECB, this effect is reinforcedby the sequencing of our instruments through which we have indicated that our policy rates willlikely remain at their current levels “well past the horizon of our net asset purchases”.Our overall assessment – and that of a growing body of empirical literature – is that non-standardmeasures have had a sizeable and lasting impact on broad financing conditions [Chart1]. These improvements are not limited to the asset classes included in our APP, but havespilled over to other market segments [Chart 2]. In addition, easier market funding conditionshave been passed through to bank lending rates. Importantly, these findings are based on arange of econometric techniques and are therefore robust to the limitations associated with anyindividual methodology.234 2 / 13BIS central bankers' speeches
Sources: ECB, ECB calculations.Event studies – which measure the impact of central banks’ bond purchases in a narrow intervalaround the time of the announcement – play a part in informing our view on the efficacy of ourpurchases. But we also use model counterfactuals to complement the impact metrics that wederive from event studies, and to test whether or not the impact of our announcements enduresbeyond the very short term. In this context, dynamic term structure models of the type that havebecome standard in contemporary fixed income finance, augmented with a factor capturingcentral bank bond holdings, have consistently confirmed the inference we draw from eventstudies. They indicate that our purchases have had a sizeable and durable influence on long-term yields.At present, the current and anticipated size of our APP portfolio – which has been increased invarious recalibration steps and is expected to be maintained “for an extended period of time” afterthe end of net asset purchases – is still putting downward pressure on euro area long-termyields. The longer the expected period of reinvestment, the stronger the downward pressure onyields. If one takes current surveys of market participants’ views about the time over which theECB is anticipated to roll over its APP securities, and assumes the modal expectation of a two-year period, one finds that the downward pressure that APP asset holdings – current andexpected – are exerting on longer-term interest rates is in the order of 100 basis points [Chart 3].56 3 / 13BIS central bankers' speeches

Source: Eser, Lemke, Nyholm, Radde, and Vladu (mimeo).Downward pressure on yields is expected to be very persistent and to decline only gradually, butconsistently, as we move forward in time, because of what is referred to as the “portfolio ageing”effect. The effects of our purchases of long-dated assets on market yields are principally due tothe fact that we withdraw duration from private hands, and as the securities we hold in ourportfolio draw closer to maturity and “lose duration” progressively, the overall amount of durationcontained in our portfolio has a tendency to melt away. And this gradual loss of duration willreduce downward pressure on yields [Chart 3].There has been a strong pass-through of our non-standard measures to financing conditions.For example, model-based counterfactual simulations attribute more than half of the 126 basispoint decline in lending rates to non-financial corporations since June 2014 directly to our non-standard measures [Chart 2]. The APP has supported the provision of loans to customers atbetter terms and conditions. Banks themselves – when asked to assess the effects of ourmeasures on their intermediation business – have reported that the APP has positively impactedtheir market financing conditions.As a consequence of this generalised easing in financing conditions, our measures have hadsubstantial macroeconomic effects. Taking into account all of the monetary policy measurestaken between mid-2014 and October 2017, the overall impact on euro area growth and inflationis estimated, in both cases, to be around 1.9 percentage points in cumulative terms for theperiod between 2016 and 2020.To sum up, the available evidence strongly supports the conclusion that the APP – together withour other non-standard measures – has been effective and probably decisive in warding offtroublesome macroeconomic outcomes. It has certainly propelled the economic recovery into arobust and broad-based expansion. And very likely, it has prevented the disinflationary pressures789 5 / 13BIS central bankers' speeches
of 2014 from spiralling into a self-reinforcing deflationary vortex [Chart 4]. We cannot yet declare“mission accomplished” on the inflation front, but we have made substantial progress on the pathtowards a sustained adjustment in inflation.Sources: Bloomberg, Reuters, ECB calculations.10 6 / 13BIS central bankers' speeches
The conduct of our monetary policyOur monetary policy reaction function has always been firmly anchored to our objective tomaintain inflation at levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Our monetary policyhas therefore evolved in line with the outlook for price stability and in a consistent manner overtime.The unprecedented challenges we faced in the pursuit of our price stability mandate led us tointroduce a complex and multi-dimensional monetary policy package. The transmission ofunconventional instruments to financial conditions, and, further down the road, to economicactivity and price developments, is surrounded by a high degree of uncertainty. This begs thequestion: how should monetary policy be conducted in such an environment?Over the past 50 years, a number of economists working in both academia and central bankshave argued for a gradual adjustment in the monetary policy stance as an optimal approach topolicy conduct in a world of uncertainty. Following the seminal work of Brainard, a case forgradualism can be made in the context of the uncertainty inherent in economic data, models andparameters, notably in times of unconventional monetary policy. In the absence of perfect orcomplete knowledge about the way market participants will react to the announcement ofmonetary policy adjustments, and about the way those uncertain reactions will transmit to ourobjective, it may be optimal to adjust policy more cautiously and in smaller steps than if we had11 7 / 13BIS central bankers' speeches
perfect knowledge.More generally, the policy calibration exercise should not be viewed as one in which the centralbank decides on the speed at which it should approach a given target level for its instrument orinstruments, but rather as an iterative and interactive process where the central bank learns fromthe markets as much as the markets learn from the implementation of the central bank’spolicies.It is through this feedback loop that central banks and markets alike learn about the nature andstrength of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. In that process, a change in theinstrument(s) has an impact that is uncertain ex ante in respect of the induced adjustments inthe yield curve and other financial prices and, as a consequence, in respect of the likelihood ofachieving the objective. Market adjustments are not known until they are observed, and we canonly work out what their implications might be for the achievement of our objective once theyhave materialised.In these conditions, the Brainard rationale for gradualism applies with great force: do it ascarefully and prudently as possible, at least when you have good reason to believe that thedegree of uncertainty as to the direction and size of market reactions is atypically large. Presenttimes, where policy is defined by a multiplicity of instruments that interact in ways that are veryimperfectly known, are characterised by an abnormal amount of uncertainty.Gradualism is not a doctrine, but a pragmatic approach that is generally suitable to situationscharacterised by significant uncertainty about the impact of available policy instruments. A moreaggressive monetary policy response, however, is warranted when there is clear evidence ofheightened risks to price stability, i.e. when it is established that the degree of inflationpersistence is likely to be high and risks disanchoring inflation expectations. In this case, aforceful, frontloaded monetary policy response to weak or excess inflation may becomenecessary to signal the central bank’s commitment to its objective, and thus nudge inflationexpectations towards that objective and make them less backward-looking.For example, when confronted with the risk of a disanchoring of inflation expectations and a tooprolonged period of low inflation, the Governing Council stated in May 2014 that it would “actswiftly” and was “unanimous in its commitment to using also unconventional instruments withinits mandate” as needed. This was followed a month later by the announcement of the battery ofnon-standard measures I already mentioned. In addition, in late 2015, we signalled ourdetermination to bring inflation back to our policy aim “without undue delay”, which justified anaggressive recalibration of stimulus at that time.Let me now turn to some concrete examples of a gradual approach. Our APP has evolvedgradually, subject to its “sustained adjustment” conditionality, i.e. the Governing Council’sintention to continue its net asset purchases until it sees a sustained adjustment in the path ofinflation consistent with its inflation aim. The purchase universe was first expanded beyondasset-backed securities and covered bonds to include public and corporate sector securities.Over time, we also extended the purchase horizon and adjusted the monthly purchase volumesto fine-tune the programme in line with our assessment of progress towards a sustainedadjustment in the path of inflation consistent with our inflation aim.Market expectations have internalised the conditionality framework that governs the size andduration of the APP quite well. Data show that market expectations of our policy are highlycorrelated with the outlook for inflation, as for example captured by medium-term inflationexpectations. This applies both to expectations regarding the horizon and volumes of the APPand to expectations relating to our “well past” guidance on policy rates [Chart 5]. Looking atsurvey medians, the residual difference between market expectations regarding the size andhorizon of our net asset purchases and the indications about the size and horizon of theprogramme announced by the ECB is today very small. In periods of persistent disinflation, this12 8 / 13BIS central bankers' speeches
difference was very large. The convergence of market expectations towards the ECB’sindications about the size and horizon of net asset purchases has proceeded in tandem with thegradual rise of inflation expectations towards our medium-term policy aim. Likewise, there is astrong co-movement between markets’ views of the convergence of inflation towards the ECB’saim on the one hand and, on the other, the length of the interval between the end of net assetpurchases and the first rate rise fully priced into market rates. This suggests that our monetarypolicy reaction function is well understood.Sources: Bloomberg and ECB.13 9 / 13BIS central bankers' speeches
Source: Bloomberg, ECB calculations.Sustained adjustment and beyondLast week, we introduced a further gradual adjustment to our monetary policy stance, removingfrom our official communication the so-called APP easing bias, i.e. a sentence in which – sinceDecember 2016 – we had expressed our readiness to increase the monthly pace and/or extendthe horizon of our net asset purchases if certain unfavourable macroeconomic or financialconditions materialised. This step followed earlier adjustments to our policy stance, namelyreductions in the pace of purchases and the removal of the easing bias on policy rates. Thisdecision conveys our improving confidence that the strong and broad-based cyclical momentumwill eventually lead to a convergence of inflation towards our aim.Overall, however, it is fair to say that we are still some way short of achieving full and durableconvergence of medium-term inflation towards levels below, but close to, 2%. The GoverningCouncil has three criteria for assessing whether there is a sustained adjustment: first, theconvergence of headline inflation to our medium-term aim; second, confidence in the realisationof the expected inflation path; and third, the resilience of inflation convergence even after the endof our net asset purchases.Signals showing the convergence of inflation towards our aim are increasingly positive and we14 10 / 13BIS central bankers' speeches
are becoming more confident that inflation will reach a level of below, but close to, 2% over themedium term. Nevertheless, from today’s perspective domestic inflation pressures are stillsubdued and a substantial degree of monetary accommodation remains necessary for pricepressures to build up and for inflation to converge sustainably towards our aim.We must be patient, persistent and prudent with our policy. Patience is needed because it takestime for underlying inflation dynamics to gain momentum and support a durable convergence ofinflation towards our aim. Persistence is needed because the recovery in inflation is predicatedon a substantial degree of monetary policy accommodation. And prudence is essential becauseof uncertainties about the transmission of unconventional monetary policy measures on the wayto normalisation.This leads me to the question of how monetary policy will evolve once the Governing Counciljudges that the criteria for a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation have been met. Theanswer to this question is essentially already indicated in our forward guidance and in the clearsequencing of policy measures that we have communicated.Once the Governing Council judges that the criteria for a sustained adjustment have been met,our net asset purchases will end. Only one of the instruments that are currently contributing tothe economic expansion and to inflation convergence will then expire. The monetary support thatwill still be necessary to accompany inflation along the path towards a durable convergence willcontinue to be provided by the remaining instruments: reinvestments and policy interest ratesthat are expected to remain at their present levels well past the horizon of our net assetpurchases.As regards reinvestments, we will maintain the stock of securities in our portfolio for an extendedperiod of time after the end of our net asset purchases and in any case for as long as necessary.As I have explained elsewhere, stock effects exert downward pressure on term premia. Mycolleague Benoît Cœuré recently referred to one further mechanism behind such a compressionof term premia: the fact that, as price-sensitive investors offload their holdings of eligiblesecurities onto the Eurosystem, the marginal seller to the programme becomes an investor typewhose supply of securities is more rigid. This perpetuates and in some cases even amplifiesthe effect of purchases on market prices.Reinvestment is also consistent with a prudent policy approach because it means the durationleakage effect – which dampens the stimulus over time – will play out only gradually.While reinvestment will be important to ensure that longer-term interest rates remain sufficientlysupportive beyond the horizon of our net asset purchases, the ECB’s key interest rates andforward guidance on their expected evolution will once again become our principal means ofsteering the policy stance.Our key interest rates are expected to remain at their present levels well past the end of netasset purchases, in line with our forward guidance. Financial markets are currently pricing ourforward guidance on rates into the yield curve, which today is fostering steady progress towardsa sustained adjustment. In the light of the interactions and complementarities between ourdifferent instruments, it will be important to monitor the reaction of the yield curve to the end ofour net asset purchases.With the passage of time, the indication that policy rates will remain at their present levels wellpast the end of net asset purchases will gradually cease to provide sufficient guidance about thelikely evolution of the monetary policy stance. So, our forward guidance on the path of our policyrates will have to be further specified and calibrated as appropriate for inflation to remain on thesustained adjustment path towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.15161 11 / 13BIS central bankers' speeches

(2017), “The ECB’s monetary policy: past and present”, speech at the Febelfin Connect event,Brussels/Londerzeel, 16 March.The impact of credit easing is estimated on the basis of an event-study methodology which focuses on theannouncement effects of the June-September 2014 package; see the ECB Economic Bulletin article entitled“The transmission of the ECB’s recent non-standard monetary policy measures” (Issue 7 / 2015). The impact ofthe deposit facility rate (DFR) cut rests on the announcement effects of the September 2014 DFR cut, while theimpact of the subsequent DFR cuts is difficult to disentangle from the simultaneous APP adjustments.Therefore, both effects are shown jointly. APP encompasses the effects of the asset purchase measuresadopted at the January and December 2015 Governing Council meetings, the March and December 2016meetings and the October 2017 meeting. The January 2015 APP impact is estimated on the basis of two event-study exercises by considering a broad set of events that, starting from September 2014, have affected marketexpectations about the programme; see Altavilla, C. Carboni, G. and Motto, R. (2015) “Asset purchaseprogrammes and financial markets: lessons from the euro area”, ECB Working Paper No 1864, and De Santis,R. (2016), “Impact of the asset purchase programme on euro area government bond yields using market news”,ECB Working Paper No 1939. The quantification of the impact of the December 2015 policy package on assetprices rests on a broad-based assessment comprising event studies and model-based counterfactualexercises. The impact of the March 2016 and December 2016 policy packages is assessed via model-basedcounterfactual exercises. The impact of the October 2017 policy package is assessed using two models: a termstructure modelling framework similar to Li, C. and Wei, M. (2013), “Term Structure Modeling with Supply Factorsand the Federal Reserve’s Large-Scale Asset Purchase Programs”, International Journal of Central Banking,9(1), pp. 3-39 and an ISIN-by-ISIN regression framework akin to D’Amico, S. and King, T. B. (2013), “Flow andstock effects of large-scale treasury purchases: Evidence on the importance of local supply”, Journal ofFinancial Economics,108(2), pp. 425-448.To this end, for instance, an estimated term structure model is used following Li, C. and Wei, M. (2013), “TermStructure Modeling with Supply Factors and the Federal Reserve’s Large-Scale Asset Purchase Programs”,International Journal of Central Banking, 9(1), pp. 3-39. In this framework, yields are driven by three factors: thelevel and slope of the yield curve (‘yield factors’) as well as a factor related to the central bank’s bond holdings(‘quantity factor’). In quantifying the impact on bond yields, the model thus takes into account the effect of thecentral bank’s current and future expected bond holdings, including the impact of reinvestment.Euro area yields are proxied by the GDP-weighted long-term yield of the four largest euro area jurisdictions. The10-year yield impacts are obtained from a version of the Li-Wei (2013) model used at the Federal Reserve toconvert the SOMA portfolio of securities into yield impacts. Impacts are shown for different APP reinvestmentscenarios, defined by the horizon indicated in the legend. The marginal impact of each additional year ofreinvestment is given by the distance between the scenario curves. Latest observation: February 2018.Praet, P.

Page 1 of 11     An address by Lesetja Kganyago, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, at the National Asset and Liability Management Conference   London  2 March 2018  Challenges for emerging-market central banks  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for the opportunity to address you on some of the challenges facing emerging-market central banks.   Since the most recent global financial crisis, central banks have faced mounting challenges. Not only were they at the forefront of saving the global economy from collapse; they were also seen as ‘the only game in town’ in restoring economic growth. Central banks also began to play a more pivotal role in ensuring financial stability in general. With these additional responsibilities and expectations, the independence of central banks became increasingly questioned, as financial regulation is considered by some to be primarily political in nature rather than technical.   The economic dimension to independence is also of importance, particularly in emerging-market economies.   My remarks today will focus on these two dimensions of independence and will consider the extent to which emerging markets have increased their resilience in recent years.   
Page 2 of 11   Political independence  The case for central-bank independence is based on the time inconsistency argument that politicians promise low inflation but are tempted to go for higher growth through expansionary monetary policies. An independent central bank, with a clear mandate to maintain price stability and without the concerns of the electoral cycle, is better-placed to focus on and achieve price stability.   The problem of ceding enormous power to unelected officials in democratic societies is solved by distinguishing between goal independence and operational independence. In many countries, central banks have been granted the latter form of independence. This distinction accords neatly with an inflation-targeting framework, where the goal of monetary policy – the inflation target – is set by law or by the elected government, and the central bank has to implement monetary policy and achieve the inflation target without political interference.   Pressures on central banks to use monetary policy to stimulate growth are not new. It is generally accepted among central bankers that while monetary policy can affect cyclical growth, its ability to determine longer-term potential output is limited. Since the global financial crisis, we have seen the potential output estimates in many countries being revised downwards. And while the need for structural reforms has been very clear in many countries too, the focus has been on monetary policy to sustain a growth recovery.   Concerted central-bank actions were probably successful in preventing a full-blown global depression, but their ability to bring about a growth recovery was less certain. There were, at times, excessively high expectations as to what monetary policy could achieve with respect to growth, and failure in this respect had the potential to undermine the credibility and legitimacy of monetary policy in general. In the event, recovery has taken some time, and it is only now that we are seeing a return to ‘normal’ growth rates on a sustainable basis. We have yet to see if the massive expansion of balance sheets and the high levels of liquidity generated by low interest rates and 
Page 3 of 11  quantitative easing will ultimately lead to the high inflation that some have feared. While this is unlikely, it remains a risk.  The global crisis originated in the financial sector and subsequently required a rethinking of the role of central banks with respect to financial stability. Prior to the crisis, this responsibility was often not explicitly part of central-bank mandates. Since then, much has changed. And while there are differing approaches among countries, the tendency has increasingly been to locate this responsibility within central banks.   A financial-stability mandate becomes more complex when dealing with the issue of independence, as it does not fit neatly into the ‘goal versus operational independence’ dichotomy. What constitutes financial-stability goals is less clear-cut than in the case of monetary policy. In addition, the policies that are available to achieve or maintain financial stability often require cooperation and coordination between various regulatory authorities, including, at times, the fiscal authorities. A challenge for central banks is ensuring that monetary-policy independence is not undermined in the process. This is particularly the case in the event of conflicts between competing objectives.   Furthermore, macroprudential policies – for example caps on loan-to-value and loan-to-income ratios and criteria for loan eligibility – often have a more visible distributional dimension, and financial-sector lobbies and interest groups are usually strong. As a consequence, central banks have unwittingly been thrust more squarely into the political realm. As their responsibility for financial stability increases, central banks could become increasingly politicized, more so than in the case of monetary policy. Macroprudential policies are often likened to taking the punchbowl away just as the party is starting. Such actions are never popular.  If independence is to be maintained, central banks need to foster the political consensus that underpins independence. This requires even greater transparency and accountability than in the case of monetary policy. Central banks also need to have the courage and political backing to make tough calls. There is always the danger that unhappiness with central-bank actions in the financial-stability field could undermine the credibility and legitimacy with respect to their core mandate of price stability. 
Page 4 of 11   The issue of independence can also be related to central-bank balance sheets, which were brought under greater scrutiny in the wake of the global financial crisis. The balance sheets in the advanced economies expanded dramatically following the extraordinary monetary-policy measures undertaken in those economies. As I will elaborate on a little later, these actions also had implications for the balance sheets of central banks in the emerging markets.   It is generally agreed that central banks should not be too concerned about incurring losses or making profits on their balance sheets. These should be regarded as part of the broader government budget constraint. Furthermore, central banks do not have a profit motive but act in the broader interest of the economy. However, central banks that incur continuous losses may ultimately require recapitalization by government and may consequently bring themselves under greater political scrutiny. These issues could divert attention from their core mandate.   The South African experience is perhaps instructive – although not unlike the problems faced by other emerging markets. The South African Reserve Bank recorded losses for five consecutive years from 2010, mainly attributable to reserve-accumulation activities. As capital flows to the emerging markets expanded as the search for yield intensified, many central banks attempted to ameliorate the impact on their currencies by buying reserves.   In South Africa’s case, we stepped up reserve accumulation – not to influence the currency, but rather to add to what we considered to be a suboptimal level of reserves.   Whatever the motive, the impact on profitability is the same. With interest rates at the lower bound in the advanced economies and typically significantly higher in the emerging markets, sterilization activities were conducted at a loss. Countries differ as to how they treat these losses, and the preferred approach often depends on legal frameworks and institutional structures. It can, however, in some instances raise questions about central-bank activities, as they are often seen as ‘losing taxpayers’ money’ and putting independence at risk.  
Page 5 of 11  Monetary-policy independence  While the political dimension of independence remains an ongoing challenge, the issue of monetary-policy independence in the emerging markets has come to the fore again recently. This is against a backdrop of what appears to be a turning point for global financial markets, following an extended period of low volatility and low interest rates in the advanced economies and an absence of inflation pressures. For some time now, the world has been anticipating interest-rate normalization in the United States (US) in particular. To date, this has been happening at a very slow and measured pace, and has been well communicated.   Over the past few weeks, global financial markets have reacted to the prospect of tighter-than-expected monetary-policy settings in the US. There was a widespread market reaction to the sharp drop in US equity prices and a large spike in the VIX. After the initial bout of volatility, the markets appear to have stabilised somewhat, but they remain vulnerable to further changes in sentiment and perceptions of risk. It does seem, however, that the prolonged period of easy money and highly liquid markets may be coming to an end, raising concerns about spillovers to the emerging markets who, as usual, are the innocent bystanders.  The current turbulence in global financial markets coupled with the return of volatility is in some ways reminiscent of the so-called ‘taper tantrum’ of 2013. After a number of years of interest rates at the zero bound and quantitative easing, the world suddenly faced the prospect of a withdrawal of stimulus. The mere suggestion that the Federal Reserve System (Fed) was considering a reduction in quantitative easing hit the financial markets hard. Long bond yields ratcheted up in the US, raising fears that the nascent growth recovery would be reversed. In the event, the Fed had to allay fears of an excessively tight policy cycle and, in reality, what tightening has occurred since then has been very moderate and well communicated.  But while there are similarities to the taper tantrum, there are important differences as well. At that stage, it was only the US that was looking to tighten policy. Today, the cycle is more synchronised. There are expectations for a more aggressive tightening cycle in the US than had previously been priced in, and further interest-rate increases 
Page 6 of 11  are expected in the United Kingdom. In addition, the European Central Bank is beginning a gradual withdrawal of stimulus. Monetary policy in Japan is, however, expected to remain highly accommodative.   A further important difference between then and now is that, after a number of false starts, the growth recovery in the advanced economies appears to be more entrenched and broad-based. This will be positive for the emerging markets.   There are also tentative signs that inflation may be on the rise as well, and the likely fiscal expansion in the US is also expected to provide some impetus. Wage growth in the US, which has been surprisingly subdued despite the tighter labour-market conditions, recently showed signs of increasing and contributed to much of the recent bout of volatility in the markets.   This time does seem to be different, and monetary-policy tightening appears to be more clearly countercyclical.  The market overreaction at the time of the taper tantrum in 2013 had a marked effect on a number of emerging markets, who had been the main beneficiaries of the capital flows generated by the highly liquid conditions. Long bond yields in the emerging markets increased and currencies depreciated as capital flows began to reverse. Monetary policies were generally tightened, although there were differences in timing and degree.  According to Eichengreen and Gupta1, the countries hit the hardest were those with wide fiscal and current-account deficits and open capital markets. South Africa fell into this category, along with Brazil, India, Indonesia, and Turkey – together given the dubious title of ‘the fragile five’. Since then, however, most emerging markets have adjusted significantly and are more resilient. But this resilience is currently being put to the test.                                                         1 Eichengreen, B and Gupta, P. 2013. ‘Tapering talk: the impact of expectations of reduced Federal Reserve security purchases on emerging markets’. World Bank Working Paper No 6754 
Page 7 of 11  One of the clear lessons of the 2013 episode was that the emerging markets are not immune to monetary-policy developments in the advanced economies. This raises the question as to whether small open economies (and that is what most emerging markets are) can conduct monetary policy independently of developments in advanced-economy financial markets. The traditional Mundell–Fleming model has taught us that monetary policy cannot be conducted independently where exchange rates are fixed. However, flexible exchange rates were expected to provide insulation against cross-border spillovers. Furthermore, perfect exchange-rate flexibility would obviate the need for reserves. This view of the world has changed since then, and for good reasons. Very few countries allow their exchange rates to float freely nowadays.   In the past few years, the issue of monetary-policy independence and the insulation properties of flexible exchange rates have been reconsidered. There is little doubt that very few countries are immune to spillovers from developments in the major advanced economies. The question is: to what extent, if at all, can emerging markets insulate themselves from external shocks?   The well-known ‘trilemma’ tells us that, with free capital mobility, independent monetary policies are possible only if exchange rates are floating. However, the sheer scale of financial globalisation in recent years has led to a rethinking of the trilemma. Hélène Rey2, for example, has posited the existence of a global financial cycle that is strongly related to monetary conditions in the US and to changes in uncertainty and risk aversion. It is argued that, because credit cycles and capital flows respond to global factors, they may be inappropriate for the prevailing cyclical conditions of many economies. This implies that, for some countries, the global cycle can lead to excessive credit growth when the economy is booming and excessive contraction during a downturn. In other words, it is conditions in the advanced economies that determine domestic financial conditions in the smaller economies, and not domestic policy rates.                                                        2 Rey, H. 2015. ‘Dilemma, not trilemma: the global financial cycle and monetary policy independence’. National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper No. 21162. 
Page 8 of 11  As Obstfeld, Ostry, and Qureshi3 have pointed out, there are a number of reasons why we would expect monetary policy to be constrained where financial integration pertains. For example, the substitutability between domestic and external financing could limit the effectiveness of domestic policy interest-rate changes on credit extension and asset prices. They also note that, even if we observe divergences between short-term rates as an indicator of insulation, there is likely to be greater co-movement of longer-term rates. Much will then depend on the extent to which long-term rates influence real variables.  For Rey, therefore, the trilemma does not exist. Rather, it is a dilemma – or what she calls ‘an irreconcilable duo’. That is: independent monetary policies are possible if, and only if, the capital account is managed, directly or indirectly, via macroprudential policies. These could include capital controls if macroprudential policies are insufficient. In other words: flexible exchange rates do not ensure independent monetary policies when capital is highly mobile. This is a rather significant conclusion for emerging markets as it means that, under conditions of free capital mobility, monetary-policy independence is not possible, irrespective of the prevailing exchange-rate regime.   But this view is not without its critics. For example, Obstfeld et al. and Gita Gopinath4 agree that the dilemma view may be overstated. However, their evidence suggests that although the trilemma lives on, it does not appear to exist in its strong form. They show that countries with exchange-rate flexibility are less sensitive to changes in global risk and less prone to economic boom-bust cycles. And although independence is not absolute, there is less loss of independence than in the case of countries with fixed exchange rates. In other words: the choice of exchange-rate regime does matter, but we should not expect complete independence with flexibility. The trilemma may be weakened, but it still applies.   Furthermore, the extent to which countries can conduct independent monetary policies also depends on their underlying resilience to global spillovers. It is generally accepted                                                       3 Obstfeld, M, Ostry, J D and Qureshi, M S. 2017. ‘A tie that binds: revisiting the trilemma in emerging market economies’.

A paper presented to the conference on ‘Rethinking macroeconomic policy IV’ at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. 
Page 9 of 11  that most emerging markets have also become more resilient since the taper tantrum: the macroeconomic fundamentals have generally improved and the domestic financial markets have developed further. In particular, real policy rates are generally higher, inflation is within the target range in most of the inflation-targeting emerging markets, and both fiscal and current-account deficits have generally narrowed. For example: for a selected sample of non-oil-exporting emerging markets5, current-account deficits as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) have narrowed significantly since 2012, averaging 0.7% in 2016 compared with 2.2% in 2013.    In South Africa’s case, our deficit has narrowed from its widest level of almost 6% of GDP in 2013 to its current level of 2.3% of GDP.   The deficits of the other so-called ‘fragile’ countries have also shown sizeable contractions. As a group, therefore, they have greater ability to withstand the impact of exogenous shocks, including sudden stops and higher interest rates in the advanced economies.    An indicator of increased resilience is the fact that, since the crisis, a number of emerging markets have made considerable progress in developing deeper and more accessible domestic-currency-denominated bond markets. They no longer suffer from what is often referred to as ‘original sin’. South Africa is again a good example of this. Prior to the crisis, although South Africa had a well-developed domestic bond market by emerging-market standards, non-residents held about 9% of total rand-denominated government debt. Today, this stands at around 40%.  This development is seen as reducing emerging-market dependence on foreign-currency debt. It is also seen as a means to reduce exposure to external shocks and increase resilience. However, this does not insulate emerging markets completely. A sudden stop or a reversal of flows would impact on bond yields and the exchange rate. The ability to absorb exchange-rate changes would differ from country to country. Countries with lower levels of foreign-currency indebtedness would be less sensitive                                                       5 Argentina, Brazil, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Pakistan, the Philippines, Poland, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey

Nevertheless, there is evidence that local-currency credit spreads are much less correlated across countries than foreign-currency credit spreads, and global factors explain significantly less variation in local-currency spreads than in foreign-currency spreads.6 In a similar vein, work by Shakill Hassan7 at the South African Reserve Bank shows a low correlation between South African short-term rates and global rates, but the correlation increases for longer maturities. Yields at the short end of the South African terms structure are highly responsive to domestic factors which affect the domestic monetary-policy stance. By contrast, long-term yields are highly responsive to changes in global bond-market developments.  A further indicator of increased resilience is the level of foreign-exchange reserves – something that would be close to the heart of the attendees of this conference. As I’ve mentioned earlier: despite increased exchange-rate flexibility, the need for reserves has not disappeared. We have seen that, over time, foreign-exchange reserve holdings have increased quite markedly in the emerging markets. This is true even if we exclude China, which has the largest holdings of reserves. Since 2005, the reserve holdings in a sample of emerging markets referred to earlier (excluding China) increased by 178% by the year 2017.   It is generally agreed that the primary motive for reserve accumulation is precautionary, as insurance against speculative attacks in times of crisis. According to research conducted by the International Monetary Fund8, there is strong empirical evidence that reserves reduce the likelihood of balance-of-payments pressures in the emerging markets. Reserves could provide the means to respond to exogenous shocks, and could calm or even prevent disorderly markets. Central banks have, however, tended to accumulate rather than to use reserves – a phenomenon sometimes referred to as ‘the fear of losing reserves’.                                                         6 Du, W and Schregger, J. 2016. ‘Local currency sovereign risk’.

Page 11 of 11  While higher levels of reserves may create the perception of resilience, simply having reserves on their own is not an effective buffer against speculative attacks or crises. Reserves do not eliminate vulnerabilities. They are not a substitute for sound policies and strong, well-regulated financial sectors.  Conclusion  In conclusion, it would appear that, at long last, the recovery from the global financial crisis is on track. It has been a difficult path, with a number of false starts and disappointments. No doubt, the road going forward will not be without its difficulties. The recovery itself is expected to bring about new challenges, for the emerging markets in particular. It is inevitable that monetary-policy normalization in the advanced economies will happen, and that the era of high global liquidity will come to an end. The impact on capital flows and global financial markets will create particular challenges for central banks at a time when political independence is being questioned. While vulnerabilities differ from country to country, the emerging markets in general appear to be more resilient in the face of the recent market volatility. Their macroeconomic fundamentals and policies have improved, making them better-placed to weather the storm than was the case five years ago.   Thank you.  
Mario Draghi: Monetary policy in the euro areaSpeech by Mr Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, at The ECB and ItsWatchers XIX Conference, organised by the Institute for Monetary and Financial Stability,Frankfurt am Main, 14 March 2018.*   *   *Over the past year, the ECB has progressively recalibrated its asset purchase programme. Wehave thereby tuned our monetary policy stance to the changing pitch of the recovery – what Ihave previously termed “accompanying the recovery”.During this time, the economy has developed even more strongly than we expected andconfidence in the euro area has increased. But it is not because real growth is strong that wecan declare the job done.There is a very clear condition for us to bring net asset purchases to an end: we need to see asustained adjustment in the path of inflation towards our aim, which is a headline inflation rate ofbelow, but close to 2% over the medium term.Thereafter, our monetary policy will have to be calibrated so as to ensure that inflation continuesalong this path.While we are now more confident than in the past that inflation is on the right track, risks anduncertainties remain. For this reason, even once the outlook becomes less dependent on netasset purchases, monetary policy still needs to be patient, persistent and prudent to guaranteethe return of inflation to our aim.Developments in the real economyThe economy has been growing consistently above current estimates of potential growth, bymore than a percentage point last year. All euro area confidence indicators are close to theirhighest levels since the start of monetary union, even if the latest readings came in slightly belowexpectations. And there are signs of pent-up demand for both consumption and investment thatstill needs to be satisfied.For consumption, one useful indicator is the gap between essential purchases, such as food andrent, and non-essential ones, such as electrical goods and holidays. Non-essential purchases –which make up around 50% of household spending in the euro area – tend to be postponedduring recessions and then to catch up as the business cycle advances. Such purchases arecurrently only 2% above their pre-crisis level, compared with 9% for essential ones. This impliesthat discretionary household spending still has scope to support the expansion.Business investment is also gathering steam as uncertainty in the euro area recedes. It nowstands 7% above its pre-crisis level and surveys point to continued strong investment demand:capacity utilisation in the capital goods-producing sector is close to all-time highs for the euroarea and for the four largest economies. Moreover, housing investment is still 17% below its pre-crisis level and is only now starting to pick up, which will likely add an extra impulse to therecovery dynamic.This positive assessment of the growth outlook is reflected in the latest ECB staffmacroeconomic projections. Annual real GDP is forecast to increase by 2.4% in 2018, 1.9% in2019 and 1.7% in 2020. Compared with the December 2017 exercise, growth has been revisedup for 2018 and remains unchanged for 2019 and 2020.The strong performance of the real side of the economy is also visible in the labour market,12 1 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
which continues on a recovery path. With employment rising by almost 7.5 million since thetrough in mid-2013, all of the job losses recorded during the crisis have now been recovered.The unemployment rate is the lowest since December 2008, despite a 2% increase in the labourforce in that time.There are some questions about the quality of these jobs: we have seen a rise in part-time andtemporary work. But surveys point to continued employment momentum. Employmentexpectations are near record highs for both industry and services. We project thatunemployment will fall to 7.2% by 2020.The contribution of monetary policy to these developments has been crucial.Our non-standard monetary policy measures have had a decisive influence on credit aggregates,as well as on bank-based transmission more broadly. We estimate that the growth rate of banklending to euro area firms would be roughly half as strong today without our measures. Banklending rates to firms would be almost 50% higher.These positive findings are further buttressed by survey-based evidence. In the Bank LendingSurvey, participating banks reported that our asset purchases contributed to an improvement oftheir liquidity position and their market financing conditions, and indicated that they have mainlyused the additional liquidity related to these purchases to grant loans. Similarly, the ECB’snegative deposit facility rate is assessed by banks to have had a positive impact on their lendingvolumes.These beneficial effects of our policy measures have been accompanied by improvements indirect market financing conditions and, taken together, have made a substantial contribution tothe economic recovery. Considering all of the monetary measures taken between mid-2014 andOctober 2017, the overall impact on euro area growth and inflation is estimated, in both cases, tobe around 1.9 percentage points cumulatively for the period between 2016 and 2020.All this has also been facilitated by two further factors. The first is the strengthening of banks’balance sheets since the crisis, with CET1 ratios for significant banks rising by 580 basis pointsabove their 2008 levels. The second is the improving the debt sustainability of both firms andhouseholds. Corporate and household indebtedness are now back to their early 2008 levels.Developments in the inflation outlookThe key question then becomes how quickly stronger demand will translate into rising prices.Both the ECB staff projections and those of other international institutions suggest that inflation ismoving in the right direction, over the medium-term horizon that is relevant for monetary policy.The latest ECB projections foresee a pickup in headline inflation from an average rate of 1.4%this year to 1.7% in 2020.This is the latest in a sequence of projection vintages with relatively similar end-points. Thisstands in contrast with the disinflationary period from 2012 to 2015, where we saw continuousdownward revisions to the inflation profile from one projection round to the next.But there are reasons why we still need to firm our confidence in this forecast.In particular, the performance of underlying inflation remains subdued compared with previousrecoveries. Looking at a broad range of measures of underlying inflation, we certainly see anupward shift relative to the lows of 2015. But most measures have yet to show convincing signsof a sustained upward trend.This is relevant because underlying inflation provides the slow-moving trend that exerts a pull on34 2 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
wage- and price-setting in the medium term. Measures of underlying inflation can thereforeprovide information about the medium-term “attractor” to which headline inflation will gravitateonce short-term shocks have faded out.There are two factors that might explain why the reaction of underlying inflation to a strengtheningeconomy is slower than in the past.First, the responsiveness of inflation to slack has weakened in recent years – a phenomenon wehave seen across advanced economies as they recover from the crisis. Comprehensiveanalysis by the Eurosystem suggests this disconnect should be temporary, as cyclical forceslinked to the crisis have been the main driver. But it is still uncertain how persistent the effects ofthese forces might be.Second, the degree of slack itself is uncertain. Even if slack is now receding, estimates of thesize of the output gap have to be made with caution. Strong growth may be leading to higherpotential output, as crisis-induced hysteresis may be reversed in conditions of stronger demand.And the effects of past structural reforms, especially in the labour market, may now be showingup in potential output.For example, three-quarters of employment growth over the recovery has come from olderworkers and more than half from women. This is in part because past labour market reformshave encouraged both groups to enter the workforce in response to higher growth. Ifsubstantially more workers can be drawn into the labour force, it would be possible for the labourmarket to strengthen further without generating wage pressures.In this environment, policymakers have to be more cautious than in the past about theassumptions that underpin our forecasts – and simple policy rules based around estimates ofthe output gap are no longer a useful guide for our actions. The severity of the crisis means thatwe cannot rely exclusively on traditional historical relationships to determine how quickly realdevelopments will be passed through into nominal ones.The key issues we need to examine are wage dynamics, their pass-through to prices, and thepossible risks to the inflation outlook.Wage growth has been trending upwards for the euro area as a whole, rising by 0.5 percentagepoints from the trough in mid-2016. But consistent with the weakening of the relationshipbetween slack and inflation, the adjustment of wages during the recovery has so far beenatypically slow.That said, our analysis suggests that, as the cycle advances, the standard wage Phillips curveshould hold better for the euro area on average. The unexplained residuals in the model – whichin the past were sizeable – are diminishing, suggesting the link between unemployment andwages should improve.Moreover, the anchors for wage formation are gradually becoming more aligned with our inflationobjective. Backward-looking factors appear to be becoming less important, and the forward-looking anchor, inflation expectations, is strengthening.Phillips curve decompositions find that past low inflation dragged down wage growth from itslong-term average by around 0.2 percentage points each year between 2014 and 2017. Butthese same analyses suggest that, as headline inflation recovers to more normal levels, theimpact of past low inflation on wages could be waning.In terms of the pass through from wages to prices, the signals remain mixed. As wages havepicked up, labour productivity has also recovered. Labour productivity grew by 0.5 percentagepoints in 2017, more than offsetting the increase in compensation per employee in the same5678 3 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
period. This has in turn caused the growth rate of unit labour costs (ULC) to slow, leading toquestions about how quickly we can expect rising wages to feed through into inflation.There are reasons why this phenomenon might be temporary. For example, in conditions ofstronger demand, productivity tends to accelerate initially because GDP rises more strongly thancapital and labour inputs, since it takes time to hire more staff or invest in new machinery. But asthese inputs catch up, productivity growth typically slows, and wage pressures translate intohigher ULCs.At the same time, after a long spell of very weak capital formation, the strong performance ofbusiness investment could prolong the productivity cycle and push back the time when ULCgrowth leads to price pressures.So this is an issue we will have to monitor closely, especially in an environment where one has tobe cautious about extrapolating past relationships into the future. To build confidence that inflationdynamics are on track, we will need to see the actual data improving over time, which meansstronger evidence of both strengthening wage growth and wage growth translating into ULCgrowth.Moreover, there are still two risks to the outlook that could – if they intensify – conspire to reduceour confidence in the inflation path.The first risk relates to the global environment, and in particular the possible spillovers of the newtrade measures announced by the US administration.Our own internal estimates suggest that the first-round effect on the euro area of the proposedmeasures is likely to be small, even if there is symmetric retaliation from US trading partners. Butthere are potential second-round effects that could have much more serious consequences.These include the risk of retaliation across other goods and an escalation of trade tensions; andthe potential for negative confidence effects, which would weigh on business investment inparticular.The second risk relates to developments in foreign exchange markets and wider financialmarkets.The euro has appreciated since the beginning of last year, and according to our analysis, thishas recently been driven more by exogenous factors – that is, purchases of euros that cannot beexplained solely by the economic expansion. This might weigh on inflation down the line as itdoes not fully arise from stronger euro area fundamentals. So this is a development we need tomonitor closely.In terms of wider financial markets, the volatility we saw in February has so far remainedconcentrated in equities, and the spillovers to other asset classes in the euro area that are morecorrelated with sentiment indicators has been moderate. But should there be any further sharprepricing in financial markets, we will need to monitor the consequences carefully.Implications for monetary policySo what does this mean for the sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, which is the keycondition for bringing net asset purchases to a gradual end?A sustained adjustment is a forward-looking concept, consistent with the medium-termorientation of our monetary policy framework.It is not determined by the latest flow of data or the performance of any specific indicator of pricepressures. Rather, we have to look through short-term price fluctuations and focus on howinflation will develop at the end of a medium-term horizon. This means a span of time that is not 4 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
too short – as monetary policy cannot control inflation in the near term – and that is not too long,because our commitment to our inflation objective has to be verifiable.Specifically, a sustained adjustment requires three conditions to be in place.The first is convergence: headline inflation has to be on course to reach our aim over ameaningful definition of the medium term. The second is confidence: we need to be sure that thisupward adjustment in inflation has a sufficiently high probability of being realised. The thirdcondition is resilience: the adjustment in inflation has to be self-sustained even without additionalnet asset purchases.As I said, successive rounds of projections give us comfort that inflation is on a rising path and isconverging toward our aim in the medium term. As for the second criterion, the confidenceinterval of our baseline projections has both narrowed and become less skewed on thedownside. Nevertheless, the upward trend of inflation is still subject to some degree ofuncertainty and downside risks have not disappeared. And this trend is still dependant on quitesome amount of monetary policy support.This is why the fundamental conditionality built into our reaction function, which makes thehorizon of the asset purchase programme conditional on a sustained adjustment in the path ofinflation, remains in place.At present, our policy stance is made up of three main elements: the flow of net assetpurchases, the stock of outstanding bonds and principal reinvestments, and our forwardguidance on the future path of key policy rates. But it is evident that the relative importance of thedifferent elements will evolve over time, in three key ways.First, net asset purchases remain necessary for now to validate the stimulus that is alreadypriced into key indices of financial conditions and on which the inflation path depends. Thereafter,when progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation is judged to be sufficient,net purchases will come to an end. At that point, next to our forward guidance, appropriatefinancial conditions will be maintained by our reinvestment policy.Re-investments will ensure a continued presence in the market, long after net asset purchasesexpire. The cumulative redemptions under the asset purchase programme between March 2018and February 2019 are expected to be around EUR 167 billion. And reinvestment amounts willremain sizeable thereafter.Second, as regards the evolution of our policy rates beyond the end of our net purchases, we willmaintain the sequencing that is currently set out in our forward guidance, namely our pledge tokeep key interest rates at their current levels “well past” the end of net purchases. This time-based element of our guidance is already vital today, in particular to ensure that our policystimulus is not weakened by premature expectations of a first rate rise, and so financialconditions remain consistent with inflation convergence.Third, as we move forward in time, the anchor for monetary policy, and the main tool for shapingthe stance, will become the path of our key policy rates and forward guidance about their likelyevolution. Our forward guidance has assured in the past, and continues to assure today stabilityto the short-end of the curve. As such, our communication, and rate path itself, will be calibratedto ensure that inflation continues to evolve along a trajectory that is consistent with the sustainedadjustment path.Adjustments to our policy will remain predictable, and they will proceed at a measured pace thatis most appropriate for inflation convergence to consolidate, taking into account continueduncertainty about the size of the output gap and the responsiveness of wages to slack. 5 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
We have proven in the past that our forward guidance is credible. This has been the case bothfor our guidance on rates and on our reaction function, notably when we laid out thecontingencies that would justify launching an asset purchase programme in response to a too-prolonged period of low inflation.ConclusionTo conclude, we currently see inflation converging towards our aim over the medium term, andwe are more confident than in the past this convergence will come to pass.But we still need to see further evidence that inflation dynamics are moving in the right direction.So monetary policy will remain patient, persistent and prudent.Draghi, M.

    5 March 2018 The new challenges facing central banks Colegio de Ingenieros de Caminos Luis M. Linde Governor  

  3/7 Let me begin by thanking the School of Civil Engineering for inviting me to inaugurate this cycle of meetings with regulatory agencies. Many thanks to the President of the School, its Management Board and all of you for being here today.  The international financial crisis that began in 2007 has given rise to various changes and to the emergence of new challenges. Central banks are, today, in a rather different and novel situation compared with where we were before the crisis some 10 years back, and we are affected by a debate about our functions in the economy and the thrust of our policies.  In the past decade central banks have increased monetary stimuli manifold and there have been deep-seated changes in the monetary and regulatory policy objectives and instruments implemented. We are now emerging from the crisis and this is raising even more the profile of the debate on the role central banks should play and whether the policies pursued in recent years should be maintained, or progressively abandoned, and at what speed and to what extent either alternative should be taken.  The challenges facing central banks can be grouped in three areas:  first, what is being labelled as the “new normal” in the macroeconomy and its implications for monetary policy;   second, the challenge for financial regulation policies;   and third, the new challenges posed by financial innovation and the new technologies. The impact of the crisis on monetary policy  But before addressing these challenges, I think it might be useful to take a short step back to remember where we have come from. We can only understand today’s challenges if we bear in mind the changes, often far-reaching, that have come about in central banks in response to the crisis.  The global financial crisis came about following a build-up of bubbles in the advanced economies, mainly in the financial and real estate sectors, a process to which easy financing conditions proved conducive in a setting in which risks were not appropriately priced.  In any event, what was surprising was the intensity and global nature of the crisis that broke in 2008. Given highly integrated financial markets and complex interconnections, instability spread rapidly, leading to the most serious financial crisis since the Second World War. In the European Union the crisis was, moreover, exacerbated by a double-dip recession, which has prolonged the recovery period and has also revealed the weakness of the euro area’s institutional framework. The crisis also left the monetary and regulatory policy “manual” that central banks had been applying in tatters.  Pre-crisis, monetary policy in the advanced economies was essentially defined by inflation targets and a key instrument, the interest rate. In parallel, the goal of financial stability was chiefly addressed with microprudential regulation and supervision. This framework was broadly consistent with the goal of economic growth, given that the control of inflation was 
 4/7  estimated to be the best means for ensuring the economy drew closer to its potential growth. The crisis showed that this framework was no longer valid. The control of inflation, though it remains a necessary condition, is not sufficient to ensure growth; and microprudential regulation was no longer effective, in or of itself, for guaranteeing financial stability.  As a result, central banks have adapted their policies, which are now more complex in terms of objectives and instruments.  Monetary policy has had to face up to the problem of what is known as the “zero bound” on interest rates. Basically, this is the situation that Keynes coined the “liquidity trap”: interest rates close to zero cease to be an effective monetary policy instrument. This has led to the development of new instruments, so-called “unconventional monetary policy”, which mainly includes quantitative easing, private and public-sector financial asset purchases, and the explanation and signalling of the monetary policy to be applied in the future, namely “forward guidance”.  The outcome has been a large increase – four- or fivefold – in the balance sheet of the main economies’ central banks. In the case of the Eurosystem, the ECB balance sheet accounted for 12% of euro area GDP before the crisis and now stands at approximately 40%, around €4.4 trillion.  Supervisory policy, for its part, has had to face the challenge of macrofinancial instability in a context of highly interconnected markets at the global level. In this area, the response has been three-pronged.  First, the strengthening of microprudential regulation, with the new Basel III Accord, which includes greater capital requirements and a stricter framework for systemically important financial institutions. Second, the development of a new instrument, macroprudential policy, which addresses systemic risk and the procyclical behaviour of the financial system as a whole. And, third, the greater international coordination of regulation, which is necessary given the reality of globalised financial markets. Notable in terms of coordination has been the creation of the Financial Stability Board and, in the case of the European Union, the activation of the Banking Union, beginning with the SSM and the Single Resolution Mechanism. The new monetary policy  I shall now turn to the challenges central banks face. The first is, evidently, identifying what is understood by the “new normal”.  One question on which economic policy discussions are focusing is whether the advanced economies are in a new situation of secular stagnation, a “new normal” characterised by low growth, low inflation and low interest rates.  We are seeing how, despite lower unemployment rates and the closing of the gap between potential and real output, inflation rates remain persistently low. A series of factors can account for this behaviour. Some are transitory, such as the insufficient increase in employment, or the impact of deleveraging processes in some economies. But there are 
  5/7 also factors of a more structural nature, including the effect of globalisation and technological progress, or demographic factors. In any event, it should be stressed that there are other policies apart from monetary policy. In particular, both fiscal policy and structural reforms have a key role to play in supporting demand, boosting real interest rates and raising productivity and potential growth. Regarding monetary policy, the central question is this: to what extent should the macroeconomy of the “new normal” lead to a new “conventional model” for monetary policy? In particular, it is considered whether the management of the central bank’s balance sheet will become entrenched as a permanent part of the normal instruments of monetary policy. Estimates, while subject to major uncertainty, suggest that real interest rates and inflation will remain at low levels, meaning that nominal rates will also be low, thereby limiting their effectiveness as a monetary policy instrument. Against this background, central banks are likely to retain the use of unconventional monetary policies. Analysis of these policies is leading to debate, as yet inconclusive, on their effectiveness, the optimal size of central bank balance sheets and on the impact that they might have in terms of financial stability and the medium- and long-term fiscal situation.  True, as the recovery gains momentum, and provided this translates into a sustained adjustment by inflation towards its target, the need for monetary policy to support the economy will tend to diminish. The US Federal Reserve has already begun to reduce its balance sheet at a gradual and predictable pace, and the ECB has slowed the pace of increase of its own balance sheet. This reduction in stimuli will extend the monetary policy headroom for acting effectively in the face of possible future crises. The monetary policy normalisation strategy can but be slow and will tend to be applied predictably, with close scrutiny of its impact both on economic growth and inflation and on financial stability.  It is worth recalling that, in 2013, the markets rather hastily interpreted some statements by the Federal Reserve, the clarification or correction of which gave rise to a bout of turbulence, owing to the different forecasts as to the speed at which expansionary monetary policy would be abandoned or softened. That episode provided a lesson for all central banks that have applied unconventional policies, in two respects: monetary policy should be corrected very slowly, and the correction should be predictable to the markets. In sum, predictability and a clear communication strategy will be important in preventing adverse market reactions.  Financial regulation and supervision  The second area I would like to mention concerns the challenges in financial regulation and supervision. As I said, the crisis has led to an overhaul of financial regulation, centred on three main areas: the strengthening of microprudential regulation; the development of macroprudential regulation; and the stepping-up of international coordination. These new regulations provide a scenario of greater security for the financial sector. If we have learned anything in recent years it is that there is always a risk of another crisis. But I believe we are now better prepared. The new regulations impose greater capital 
 6/7  requirements on financial institutions and stricter supervision, including new instruments for the early identification of financial risks.  The main challenge for regulatory policy is now to fully implement the reforms approved and to closely monitor their impact on the financial sector, and, where appropriate, to calibrate the new regulatory framework. Along with this general challenge, I would highlight two elements that will have a bearing on regulatory policy management.  Firstly, the interrelatedness of monetary and macroprudential policy. Generally, both policies can be complementary. But, as the years of expansion prior to the financial crisis demonstrated, the economy’s cyclical position and the accumulation of financial risks may become decoupled. Financial imbalances thus built up, and yet inflation was contained and the real economy appeared to show no signs of overheating.  Central banks will have to have both policies strike a balance in order to achieve the dual objective of economic and financial stability. Here it is important to have an institutional structure that ensures synergies and consistency between monetary and prudential policies.  The second conditioning factor is the fact that globalised financial markets are a reality, which requires a permanent international coordination effort in the management of financial policies. Coordination is needed to tackle contagion across different markets in jurisdictions and, also, to prevent regulation being distorted by means of regulatory arbitrage, or the competitive lowering of regulatory standards across jurisdictions.  Fora such as the Financial Stability Board, the Basel Committee and the European Single Supervisory and Resolution Mechanisms have gained in importance. A third pillar, the European Deposit Insurance Scheme, has still to be defined and remains the subject of political negotiations.  The challenges of financial and technological innovation  Finally, I shall refer to the challenges posed by financial and technological innovation.  Since the year 2000 we have witnessed a proliferation of technological changes that are re-shaping the global economy. This started with the Internet, which was only incipient at the turn of the century, followed by electronic trade, mobile phones, artificial intelligence and big data. Technology is introducing new types of services and products, and is challenging the traditional commercial models in all economic sectors.  In the case of the financial system, there is considerable scope for improving the efficiency and quality of services through the application of new technological processes. We are seeing how new technologies are being incorporated into traditional functions, for instance in how payments are made, in the automated management of risk pricing and in financial consultancy.  The financial sector is adapting to this new reality. Traditional banks are taking the new technologies on board, occasionally through strategic alliances with new technology firms. New companies are also being incorporated into the sector, ranging from small start-ups to large firms. The new firms must, however, win the confidence of consumers and investors, 
  7/7 something that traditional financial institutions have secured over a long period of time, anchored by strong regulation and financial supervision.  From the standpoint of the regulators, the fintech challenge affects both prudential and consumer protection policies.  From the prudential perspective, regulators must strike a balance between catalysing innovation and the efficiency that new technologies can provide, and maintaining a sound regulatory framework. The guiding principle should be to apply the same regulation for the same type of financial services. In this respect, as the presence of fintech increases, it might be useful to put greater emphasis on the regulation of services, instead of placing it on the institutions that provide these services.  Turning to consumer protection policies, it is vital that investors and consumers should understand how the new services function and the attendant risks, including, for example, credit, cyber-security and privacy-protection risks. Here we should strengthen our information and financial education policies.  We are mindful at the Banco de España of the need to step up our efforts in this area. Indeed, last week we approved a reform whereby, under our Directorate General Operations, Markets and Payment Systems, a new Associate Directorate General Financial Innovation and Market Infrastructures was created to assume the competencies in these areas, centralising in this new structure the functions previously assigned to different units in the Bank.  This Associate Directorate General will have to face two families of problems.  First, the questions that arise with the emergence of new agents and new operators in the financial markets, providing services that already existed (but in a different way), or services that did not exist, namely new types of financial services. As regards these new market players, two groups of problems are posed: on one hand, those referring to matters of competencies, i.e. all agents and operators should be subject to the same demands or regulations; on the other, investors and consumers should be protected and alerted as to the new risks, just as they are in respect of the former operators and their products.  The second family of matters which the new Associate Directorate General of the Banco de España must face concerns new technology and its application in financial markets, something which, in these times of continuous innovation, is obviously of great importance.  Thank you for your attention.   
Urjit R Patel: Banking regulatory powers should be ownershipneutralInaugural Lecture by Dr Urjit R Patel, Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the Centre forLaw & Economics, Centre for Banking & Financial Laws Gujarat National Law University,Gandhinagar, 14 March 2018.*   *   *I speak today to highlight some fundamental fissures that exist in the regulation of banks, inparticular, public sector banks (PSBs). It has been slightly over a month since the latest fraud inthe Indian banking sector broke news.Success has many fathers; failures none. Hence, there has been the usual blame game,passing the buck, and a tonne of honking, mostly short-term and knee-jerk reactions. Theseappear to have prevented the participants in this cacophony from deep reflection and soulsearching that can help solve fundamental issues that are the root cause of such frauds andrelated irregularities in the banking sector, which as I will explain are in fact far too regular.Let me start with what has been at the heart of some of the immediate reactions – the ReserveBank’s supervision of banks.IMF/World Bank FSAP AssessmentIn its 2017 Financial Sector Assessment Programme (FSAP) of India, conducted, completed andreleased prior to this episode, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank (WB),made the following observations:1.In the publicly released FSSA (Financial System Stability Assessment) report, Para 35, page17: The RBI has made substantial progress in strengthening banking supervision: A keyachievement was the introduction in 2013 of risk-based supervision through acomprehensive and forward-looking Supervisory Program for Assessment of Risk andCapital (SPARC). The Basel III framework and other international guidance wereimplemented or are being phased in, including stricter regulations on large exposures.Domestic and cross-border cooperation arrangements are now firmly in place. The AQR[Asset Quality Review] and the strengthening of regulations in 2015 have improveddistressed asset recognition. In April 2017, the RBI established a new EnforcementDepartment and revised its prompt corrective action framework to incorporate more prudentrisk-tolerance thresholds.2.Further, in its specific comments on Other Regulation, Accounting, and Disclosure (CorePrinciples or CPs 20, 26–29: Para 60, page 21): The internal control regulations issued bythe RBI are adequate and are supported by the requirements of the SPARC risk-basedsupervision system. This system provides extensive guidelines for inspection of the internalcontrol and audit function, and prescribes that a bank’s internal controls allow identificationand controlling of risks. The Internal Audit Departments in banks are required to haveappropriate resources and staff with the requisite skills. Tasks can be outsourced, allowingadditional expertise to be brought in. The auditors reported that overall experience with thequality of internal audit of banks was satisfactory.However, the FSAP for India laments at several points the fact that the Reserve Bank’sregulatory powers over banks are not neutral to bank ownership:1.In the Detailed Assessment Report (DAR) on the Basel Core Principles (BCP) on theEffective Banking Supervision, Para 6, Page 7:Some previously observed weaknessesconcerning the independence of the RBI and the inherent conflict of interest when1 / 8BIS central bankers' speeches
supervising public sector banks (PSBs) remain. The RBI enjoys a large degree ofoperational autonomy, but amendments to several legal provisions, and formal grounding ofRBI independence in the RBI Act, would provide greater legal certainty. The RBI’s legalpowers to supervise and regulate PSBs are also constrained– it cannot remove PSBdirectors or management, who are appointed by the government of India (GoI), norcan it force a merger or trigger the liquidation of a PSB; it[RBI] has also limited legalauthority to hold PSB Boards accountable regarding strategic direction, risk profiles,assessment of management, and compensation. Legal reforms are thus highlydesirable to empower the RBI to fully exercise the same responsibilities for PSBs asnow apply to private banks, and to ensure a level playing field in supervisoryenforcement.2. Specifically, on Corporate Governance (CP 14, Para 50, page 18): The appropriate rules onfitness and propriety, and banks’ internal governance structures, are in place with respect toprivate and foreign banks. Nevertheless, the influence the RBI may exercise on banks’governance through section 21 BR Act, placement of RBI representatives on banks’Boards, and the RBI’s very limited authority under the Banking Acts, as well as the customto hold the PSB Boards accountable has become problematic. Under the law andaccording to custom, the RBI cannot hold PSB Boards accountable for assessingand– when necessary– replacing weak and nonperforming senior management andgovernment-appointed Board members.Let me elaborate.Banking regulatory powers in India are NOT ownership neutralAll commercial banks in India are regulated by the RBI under the Banking Regulation (BR) Act of1949. Additionally, all public sector banks are regulated by the Government of India (GoI) underthe Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1970; the BankNationalisation Act, 1980; and the State Bank of India Act, 1955. Section 51 of the amended BRAct explicitly states which portions of the BR Act apply to the PSBs, most common threadacross the omissions being complete removal or emaciation of RBI powers on corporategovernance at PSBs:1. RBI cannot remove directors and management at PSBs as Section 36AA(1) of the BR Act isnot applicable to the PSBs.2. Section 36ACA(1) of the BR Act that provides for supersession of a Bank Board is also notapplicable in the case of PSBs (and regional rural banks or RRBs) as they are not bankingcompanies registered under the Companies Act.3. Section 10B(6) of the BR Act that provides for removal of the Chairman and ManagingDirector (MD) of a banking company is also not applicable in the case of PSBs.4. RBI cannot force a merger in the case of PSBs as per Section 45 of the BR Act.5. PSB’s banking activity does not require license from RBI under Section 21 of the BR Act;hence, RBI cannot revoke a license under Section 22(4) of the BR Act as it can in the caseof private sector banks.6. RBI cannot trigger liquidation of PSBs as per Section 39 of the BR Act.7. Furthermore, in a remarkable exception of sorts, in some cases there is duality of ManagingDirector and the Chairman – they are the same – implying the MD is primarily answerableonly to himself or herself.This legislative reality has in effect led to a deep fissure in the landscape of banking regulatory123 2 / 8BIS central bankers' speeches
terrain: a system of dual regulation, by the Finance Ministry in addition to RBI. I will now take afew minutes to explain why this fissure or the fault line is bound to lead to tremors such as themost recent fraud.Temptation to engage in fraud at the level of employee or employees is always present, in banks(or in corporations), be it in public sector or private sector. The question then is whether there isadequate deterrence faced by employees from undertaking frauds and enough incentives formanagement to put in place preventive measures to preempt frauds. In case of banks, threepotentially powerful mechanisms could induce discipline against frauds:1. Investigative/vigilance/legal deterrence: Criminal investigation of frauds andattached penalties can serve as an effective deterrence if reporting and investigationare expedient and penalties are adequately severe relative to the gains fromfraudulent activity.2. Market discipline: Fraudulent activity can be a net loss to the bottom-line; in thiscase, bank investors would impose deterrence, e.g., uninsured creditors might “run”on the bank inducing liquidity problems, or shareholders might “exit”, effectivelyraising the cost of capital and inducing solvency questions. In anticipation of suchdisruptive outcomes that might cause loss of control, management and boardmembers may put in place governance mechanisms to prevent or reduce theincidence of fraud and/or hold larger buffers in the capital structure to bear losseswhen fraud materialises.3. Regulatory discipline: Banks in most parts of the world, however, have asignificant portion of deposit funding that is insured, and since banks serve criticalpayments and settlements function, they are often too big to fail or too many to fail.Hence, a part of the market discipline is weakened as a tradeoff with financialstability and is substituted by delegation of supervisory and regulatory powers to abanking regulator. Detection and punishment by the regulator then need to beeffective to discipline fraud.How do these mechanisms work in case of private and public sector banks in India?Investigative and formal enforcement process takes in our country, perhaps for the right reasons,a fair bit of time. Indeed, RBI data on banking frauds suggests that only a handful of cases overthe past five years have had closure, and cases of substantive economic significance remainopen. As a result, the overall enforcement mechanism – at least until now – is not perceived tobe a major deterrent to frauds relative to economic gains from fraud.It is fair to say that in case of private sector banks, the real deterrence arises from market andregulatory discipline, and their confluence. A private bank CEO’s primary concern is whethers/he will be able to raise capital when the need arises or even whether s/he will still be runningthe bank the next day. The point is that they could be readily cautioned through their Boards andeven replaced by the RBI in case of large or persistent irregularities. Further, a private bankfailing to meet bank solvency standards and under RBI’s “prompt corrective action” (PCA) wouldfind it hard to raise capital, whereby it would need to put the house in order at swift notice so itcan raise funding from markets and get back to growth path. In turn, there are incentives to investin governance, so as to limit frauds and regulatory violations, and to respond with alacrity whenincidents do arise.In contrast, the market discipline mechanism for public sector banks is appreciablyweakercompared to that at private banks. There is implicitly a stronger perceived sovereignguarantee for all creditors of PSBs, and the principal shareholder – the government – has not sofar been interested in fundamentally modifying the ownership structure. From an economic3 3 / 8BIS central bankers' speeches
standpoint, this weakened market discipline should imply that the government wouldprefer strongerregulatory discipline of these banks, not weaker. However, as I explained above atlength, and perhaps since the original idea behind bank nationalisation was complete governmentcontrol over credit allocation to the economy, the situation in India is exactly the reverse: RBI’sregulatory powers over PSBs are weaker than those over the private sector banks.The BR Act exemptions for PSBs mean that the one agency – the regulatory – that can respondrelatively quickly against banking frauds or irregularities cannot take effective action. Hence, forexample, MDs at PSBs find it comfortable to tell media that business will be as usual for themunder RBI’s Prompt Corrective Action framework as even if they do not meet the stipulatedrestrictions of the framework, the ultimate authority over their tenure is with the government andnot with the RBI.It is not entirely surprising that there has been a recurring theme in report after report on financialsector reforms in the country that has suggested strengthening of PSB governance throughimprovement in top management and Board member appointments; or, ownership neutrality inbanking regulatory powers; or improving market discipline by considering a variety of diverseownership structures.Will we let another opportunity to catalyse fundamental reform at PSBs pass by?It is fully transparent what needs to be done. From the RBI’s standpoint, legislative changes tothe BR Act that make our banking regulatory powers fully ownership neutral – not piecemeal,but fully – is a minimum requirement. It might also be the most readily feasible of these options.No banking regulator can catch or prevent all fraudsAnother point is in order before I move to the broader issue of bank stressed assets and theirresolution. There has been a tendency in the pronouncements post revelation of the fraud thatRBI supervision team should have caught it. While that can always be said ex post with anyfraud, it is simply infeasible for a banking regulator to be in every nook and corner of bankingactivity to rule out frauds by “being there”. If a regulator could achieve such perfect outcomes, itwould effectively imply that the regulator can do anything that banks can do, and by implication,can simply perform the entire banking intermediation activity itself. What is needed is that variousmechanisms to deter frauds and other irregularities are in place and have bite so that fraudincidence is low and magnitudes contained. Indeed, frauds have happened at banks in regimeswith varied levels of banking regulatory quality and in both public and private banks.In the specific case at hand, the Reserve Bank had identified, based on cyber riskconsiderations, the exact source of operational hazard –through which we understand now thefraud had been perpetrated. In particular, the RBI had issued precise instructions via threecirculars in 2016 to enable banks to eliminate the hazard. It turns out ex post the bank had simplynot done so. Clearly, the internal processes at the bank failed in allowing the operational hazardto remain in place in spite of clear instructions to close it. As we have stated in RBI’s only pressstatement on this case to date, this was essentially an operational failure at our second largestpublic sector bank. The RBI will undertake actions against the bank that it is empowered to butthis set is limited under its BR Act powers over PSBs.Indeed, in a recent interview to the Press Trust of India, March 11 2018, the IMF Deputy ManagingDirector Tao Zhang has reinforced this point along with others I alluded to above:“[W]e think the PSB recapitalisation should be part of a broader package of financial reforms tospeed up the resolution of NPAs, improve PSB governance, reduce the role of the public sectorin the financial system, and enhance bank lending capacity and practices… The expertsrecommended legal changes to enable the RBI to extend all the powers currently exercised overprivate sector banks to public sector ones; in particular, regarding Board member dismissals,4 4 / 8BIS central bankers' speeches
mergers, and license revocation… Having said that, banks’ operational risk management, riskculture, internal control frameworks and external audit function should typically play a central rolein preventing fraud.”Need to refocus on the bigger issue of stressed assets resolutionLet me now turn to an issue of greater magnitude and more significance than the most recentbanking fraud. Its magnitude is larger than 8 1/2 lakh crores of stressed assets on bank balance-sheets and its significance stems from several practices in promoter-bank credit relationship thatneed immediate attention. The RBI’s Financial Stability Report of June 2017 (Section VII. Frauds,Para 3.36) clarifies that there is a link between bank frauds and this stressed assets problem:“One of the emerging risk to the financial sector is increasing trends in frauds in commercialbanks and financial institutions. During the last five financial years, frauds have increasedsubstantially both in volume and value terms. During this period, while the volume of frauds hasincreased by 19.6 per cent from 4235 to 5064, the value (loss incurred) has increased by 72 percent from Rs. 97.5 billion (Rs. 9,750 crores) to Rs.167.7 billion (Rs. 16,770 crores). Share offrauds in [loan] advances portfolio continued to be high at 86 per cent of the fraudsreported during 2016–17 (in terms of amount involved)…In a number of large valuefrauds, serious gaps in credit underwriting standards were evident. Some of the oftenseen gaps are liberal cash flow projection at the proposal stage, lack of continuousmonitoring of cash flows and cash profits (EBITDA), lack of security perfection and overvaluation, gold plating of projects, diversion of funds, double financing and general creditgovernance issues in banks. Moreover, almost all corporate loan related fraud cases getseasoned for 2 to 3 years as NPAs before they are reported as fraud.”The broad conclusion that has been universally reached is that enterprises in India have over andover again received excessive credit during loan growth cycles, which is followed soon after withrepayment problems. Rather than resolving stressed credit problems swiftly, banks–eitherthrough loan-level “fudges” or refusal to recognise the true asset quality of the credits – haveallowed promoters in charge of enterprises to have a soft landing. This soft landing hascomprised of even more bank lending so as to keep the accounts artificially in full repayment onpast dues, protracted control for promoters over failed assets, and effectively granting them theability to divert cash and assets, often outside of our jurisdictional reach.The RBI has been clamping down on the failure to recognise asset quality as non-performing asper its norms by requiring that banks, whose “divergence” exceeds by 15% of the true non-performing assets as per the norms, disclose the divergence. This should restore some marketdiscipline against such practices, especially in the case of private sector banks. However,ultimately there also needs to be a framework in place for time-bound resolution of the underlyingstress in assets that limits the discretion of banks to delay the recognition of stress, ever-green“zombie” or living-dead borrowers, and poorly allocate credit.To this end, I wish to present and clarify the rationale behind RBI’s revised framework for promptrecognition and resolution of stressed assets. The framework that was released last monthremains somewhat under-appreciated in terms of its importance. So let me lay it out.Prompt recognition and resolution of stressed assets – revised framework1. The Banking Regulation (Amendment) Act, 2017, and the subsequent authorisation given bythe Government of India therein, has empowered the Reserve Bank to issue directions to thebanks for resolution of stressed assets, including referring assets to the Insolvency andBankruptcy Code 2016 (IBC). The Reserve Bank has taken steps over the last year in thisdirection, with a focus on reference to the IBC of certain large value stressed accounts,covering approximately 40% of banking sector’s overall exposure to the stressed assets. 5 / 8BIS central bankers' speeches
2. The revised framework for resolution of stressed assets released by the Reserve Bank onFebruary 12, 2018 is a step towards taking these initial steps to their natural conclusion andlaying down a steady-state approach. The steady-state approach is aimed at ensuring earlyresolution of stressed assets in a transparent and time-bound manner so that maximumvalue could be realised by the lenders while also recognising the potential ongoing concernvalue of stressed assets. As explained below, this approach is a positive step towardsstrengthening the credit culture in the economy, at both borrowers and banks.3. Various special schemes for resolution, which were introduced by the RBI in the pre-IBCcontext, had made the resolution process driven by asset-classification consideration oflenders. In particular, the forbearance that was embedded in the schemes to make it easierfor banks to resolve assets became an end in itself with little resolution achieved throughdeployment of the schemes.4. The revised framework substitutes for these pre-IBC schemes and does away withforbearance since it delayed resolution. The framework relies instead on the biggeststructural reform in the credit system in the country in several decades, viz., the IBC, as animportant part of resolution. By employing the IBC as its lynchpin, the framework is intendedrightly to ensure that the resolution plan for stressed assets is dictated also, and in fact,primarily, by asset viability considerations.5. It must be stressed that the revised framework would allow lenders absolute flexibility to putin place any credible resolution plan, as under the pre-IBC schemes, subject to meetingcertain implementation conditions (the conditions being necessary to alleviate concernsrelating to ever-greening of unviable assets).6. In particular, in respect of accounts with aggregate exposure greater than Rs. 2,000 crores,the resolution plan would be required to be implemented within 180 days from the date ofdefault, failing which these would be referred under the IBC. This threshold would be broughtdown only gradually over a period of two years to enable the IBC infrastructure to install inparallel the required capacity to handle more cases. It must be emphasised that IBC itself isa resolution framework, whereby such accounts will have sufficient time (180 days from thedate of default plus up to 270 days under the IBC) for effective resolution.7. It must also be underscored that under the revised framework:Change of ownership is being favoured even prior to the IBC reference as it leads toasset being classified as standard (as under the earlier schemes). The defaultingpromoters also risk losing control of the firm under the IBC bidding. Hence, therevised framework will engender incentives for borrowers to not over-borrow andinstead to manage better the various business risks that might lead to default.There will also be greater incentive for lenders to implement an efficient turnaroundplan to get a quicker upgrade in case of restructuring. Further since there is noforbearance for assets classified as NPAs, the revised framework will encouragebanks to reduce slippages to NPAs through early recognition of stress and timelyaction, possibly even before a borrower gets into financial difficulty.In other words, the IBC along with RBI’s revised framework will help break the promoter-bank nexus which has led to crony capitalism and attendant NPA/credit misallocationproblem as ever-greening suited some borrowers and some lenders under the earlierframework. In turn, this will prevent the erosion of growth from the emergence of zombiefirms and secto1. Finally, the revised framework specifically excludes the revival and rehabilitation of Micro,Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) with exposures of up to Rs. 25 crore, which shallcontinue to be covered under the earlier norms.We believe this is precisely the fundamental reform needed in order to strengthen the credit 6 / 8BIS central bankers' speeches
culture at origination, default, asset quality recognition and resolution stages. By so doing, itshould weaken in the first place opportunities for engaging in frauds relating to loan advances.Let me now make some Concluding remarks.I have chosen to speak today to convey that we at the Reserve Bank of India also feel the anger,hurt and pain at the banking sector frauds and irregularities. In plain simple English, thesepractices amount to a looting of our country’s future by some in the business community, incahoots with some lenders. As safeguards of your deposits at banks, and starting with the AssetQuality Review of banks announced by the Reserve Bank in 2015 – since ably conducted by oursupervisory teams and as acknowledged objectively by experts of reputed multilateral agencies,we are doing all we can to break this unholy nexus.I see what we have undertaken for cleaning up the credit culture of the country – in particular, thecomprehensive regulatory overhaul announced by the Reserve Bank on February 12th forprompt recognition and resolution of NPAs at banks – as the Mandara mount or the churning rodin the Amrit Manthan or the Samudra Manthan of the modern day Indian economy. Until thechurn is complete and the nectar of stability safely secured for the country’s future, someonemust consume the poison that emanates along the way. If we need to face the brickbats and bethe Neelakantha consuming this poison, we will do so as our duty; we will persist with ourendeavours and get better with each trial and tribulation along the way.I do wish more promoters and banks, individually – or collectively through their industry bodies,would reconsider being on the side of Devas rather than Asuras in this Amrit Manthan.The owner of our public sector banks – the government –which has provided the IBC, the relatedordinances and the bank recapitalisation package to get the churn going, might consider makingfurther, equally important contributions by:1. Making banking regulatory powers neutral to bank ownership and leveling the playing fieldbetween public sector and private sector banks; and,2. Informing itself about what do with the public sector banking system going forward as part ofoptimising over the best use of scarce national fiscal resources.It is an open issue whether centralised government control alone can be effective enough atdesigning and implementing governance of banking franchise comprising over 2/3rds of thesector’s deposits and assets. It would be better instead to restore regulatory and marketdiscipline.These, and other structural reforms to the banking sector, would enable India to grow sustainablyat respectable rates. Thank you.It is to be noted here that the FSAP also mentions in Other Regulation, Accounting, and Disclosure (CPs 20, 26–29, Para 62, page 21): Currently, the external auditor is not obliged to report immediately to the RBI regulatorany issues encountered in the audited bank that are of material interest to the supervisor. This is only permittedafter publication of the annual statements. Moreover, regulators need powers to access the auditor’s workingpapers when needed. This is currently not envisaged. The laws and/or regulations should explicitly authorise theexternal auditor to inform the RBI of any concerns at any time; also, before the annual statements have beenfinalised and published. The RBI should be given the explicit authority to obtain information at any time from theexternal auditor. This point, however, applies both for public and private sector banks.The exception to this is IDBI Bank Ltd., for which the Articles of Association (Clause 120) grant the RBI therequisite authority.Of course, there are several other (well documented) implications of being public sector banks: boardconstitution, wherein it is difficult to categorise any director as independent; significant and widening123 7 / 8BIS central bankers' speeches
compensation differences with private sector banks, leading to the erosion of specialist skills; external vigilanceenforcement though the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI); andlimited applicability of the Right To Information (RTI) Act.The duality of banking regulatory powers exists even in the case of co-operative banks where the RBI has tocontend with several powers being vested away from it in hands of state governments. Co-operative banks aretypically small and their failures are dealt adequately with through liquidation by the Deposit Insurance andCredit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) which insures some of their depositors. This duality also needs to beaddressed as part of the broader banking sector reforms to improve credit culture and reduce fraudulentlending.4 8 / 8BIS central bankers' speeches
Stephen S Poloz: Today's labour market and the future of workRemarks by Mr Stephen S Poloz, Governor of the Bank of Canada, at the Chancellor DavidDodge Lecture in Public Finance 2018, Kingston, Ontario, 13 March 2018.*   *   *I would like to thank Russell Barnett for his help with this speech.IntroductionI am delighted to be back at Queen’s, where I earned an undergraduate degree in economicssome 40 years ago. I remember this time of year well. It is a stressful time—whether you arestressed about starting your career, getting into your next degree program, or just getting thisyear’s work done.Those of you who hope to join the workforce may be feeling both excitement and nervousnessabout an uncertain future. At least the macroeconomic situation you face is a positive one. Theeconomy has created 283,000 jobs over the past 12 months, and the unemployment rate is aslow as it has been in more than 40 years.However, this may still leave you wondering about the future. We have all heard stories of peoplestruggling to get a foot in the door, of being overqualified and underemployed, and of thechallenges of building a stable career in the “gig economy.” Meanwhile, automation anddigitalization are disrupting entire industries and threatening to make some jobs obsolete.Given this backdrop, I will use my time today to talk about Canada’s labour market—why thecentral bank pays such close attention to it, and what role monetary policy can play in itsperformance. I will also take the risk of speculating a little on what lies further ahead for you—onthe future of work.Labour, economic supply and potential outputLet me start with why the Bank of Canada—whose central objective is to target low and stableinflation—cares so much about the labour market. Simply put, it is because inflation is driven bythe balance of demand and supply in the economy, and the labour market is the heart of thatbalance.When demand is less than supply, inflation tends to fall, and vice versa. When supply anddemand are roughly in balance, inflation tends to stabilize around the level where people’sinflation expectations lie—in Canada’s case, our target of 2 per cent annual inflation.To maintain this balance, a central bank needs to understand all the elements that make upsupply and demand. At the top of the list for supply is labour. The more people available to work,and the more productive they are, the greater the contribution that labour makes to supply. Inevery economy, demographic forces and immigration determine the available workforce.A complementary role in supply growth is played by investment. Investment spending expands orimproves an economy’s capital stock—the machinery and equipment available to workers, aswell as infrastructure such as roads, ports or information technology networks. New investmentcan give existing workers updated tools that raise their productivity. Or, it can mean an expansionof the firm, which is accompanied by new job creation. Both channels raise the economy’spotential output.Canada has reached the phase of the economic cycle where investment usually takes over asthe lead engine of growth and this capacity-building process becomes central. I think of this 1 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
phase of the cycle as the “sweet spot,” where rising demand actually drives the creation of newsupply. With many companies operating near their capacity limits, growing their sales furthermeans increasing investment, leading to the creation of new jobs and increased aggregatesupply. Obviously, this is a phase worth nurturing.By far the most potent form of business investment is the creation of brand new companies.New firms apply the latest technologies in novel ways, sometimes creating completely newindustries. As successful new firms exploit new technologies, they can grow very rapidly. Theirsales growth chart sometimes looks like a hockey stick, or the left side of the Eiffel Tower.You can imagine how the creation of numerous new companies might affect the overallperformance of our economy. Each firm that sees hockey-stick growth adds disproportionately tothe overall productivity of the economy. Indeed, historically, a large share of an economy’s gainsin productivity and new job creation have come from young companies.This is why a period of slow productivity growth is usually associated with slow rates of newcompany formation. We are—at long last—finally seeing some encouraging signs in these data.This follows a long lacklustre stretch in the wake of both the global financial crisis and the periodof high oil prices and exceptional Canadian dollar strength from 2010 to 2013.Importantly, this process of rapid growth generates higher incomes that people spend in everysector of the economy, benefiting everyone. However, newly created economic growth isdisruptive, sometimes destroying existing companies and jobs along the way. This may soundlike today’s issue, but it has been a characteristic of economic growth for all time. It was aptlydescribed a long time ago by Joseph Schumpeter as “creative destruction.” I will say more aboutthis process in a few minutes.However, none of this highly desirable economic growth can happen unless there are peopleavailable to fill the newly created jobs. Accordingly, a healthy, well-functioning labour market iscritical, particularly at this stage of the business cycle.  There are many ways to measure labour market health. We start with the unemployment ratebecause it is intuitive and the most commonly reported indicator. It is also as low as it has beensince 1976 when Statistics Canada started tracking it this way, which is good.But the unemployment rate does not tell the whole story. To illustrate, imagine someone whosecompany closed back in 2010 and who gave up looking for work after months or years ofunemployment. This person is no longer participating in the labour market and so is not countedas unemployed. But he or she could still be pulled back into the workforce if the right opportunitycame along and so represents a potential source of new supply.Furthermore, no analysis of the labour market is complete without considering the impact ofdemographics, specifically, the impact of the Baby Boom generation. The first Baby Boomersbegan to enter the labour market in the early 1960s and fuelled labour force and economicgrowth for the next 50 years. This demographic support is now fading. Immigration can helpprovide an important offset, but we should also be doing everything we can to develop untappedsources of labour supply within our existing population.Breaking down the numbersAfter looking at a much wider range of labour market indicators, the Bank has concluded thatthere remains a degree of untapped supply potential in the economy. This is important, for itmeans that Canada may be able to have more economic growth, a larger economy, andtherefore more income per person, without generating higher inflation. So, let me turn to a deeperanalysis of that issue. 2 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
Young people represent one source of untapped potential. Yes, the unemployment rate forpeople in the 15 to 24 age group has declined to around 11 per cent. However, youth are notparticipating in the workforce as much as they did 10 years ago.Traditionally, labour force participation rates decline during recessions and rebound duringperiods of economic growth. But while most other population groups have seen their participationrates recover from the Great Recession, that has yet to occur for young Canadians.Some have argued that this should not be a concern, because it reflects an increasingly popularchoice to remain in school and get more education. In cases where that is true, I certainly agree.School enrolment has increased over the last decade. However, the full story is more complex.For one thing, many students historically have chosen to work and go to school at the sametime. I am sure that many of the students in this room have a part-time job, not just to earnmoney but also to gain valuable work experience. I know I did. However, the current participationrates of all student groups—males and females, 15 to 19 years old and 20 to 24 years old—areall below pre-crisis levels. Further, while young people who are not at school have higher labourforce participation rates than students do, their rates are all lower than they were before thecrisis.Because this drop in youth participation coincided with the crisis and Great Recession, I cannotbelieve that everything we are seeing today simply represents people choosing to stay out of theworkforce. Clearly, a good part of the decline is tied to the economic cycle, and a shortage ofopportunities. Other forces, including demographics, may be acting here as well.The key point is that youth represent an important untapped source of potential economic growth.If the youth participation rate were to return close to its level before the crisis, more than 100,000additional young Canadians would have jobs.An even more significant source of economic potential is higher labour force participation bywomen. While about 91 per cent of prime-age men participate in the labour force, the rate forwomen is only about 83 per cent.History suggests that this gap can narrow. Consider Quebec, where, 20 years ago, the prime-age female participation rate was about 74 per cent. The provincial government identified barrierskeeping women out of the workforce and acted to reduce them, particularly by lowering the costof child care and extending parental leave provisions. Within a few years, proportionately moreprime-age Quebec women had jobs than women in the rest of Canada. Today, Quebec’s prime-age female participation rate is about 87 per cent.If we could simply bring the participation rate of prime-age women in the rest of Canada up to thelevel in Quebec, we could add almost 300,000 people to our country’s workforce. The recentFederal Budget introduced some new measures in this direction.There’s more. Employment rates among indigenous peoples—one of the youngest demographicgroups in Canada—remain well below those of the rest of the country. And, as Senior DeputyGovernor Carolyn Wilkins pointed out in a speech last month, technological advances arebreaking down barriers that have been keeping some of the millions of Canadians who live withdisabilities out of the workforce.Finally, much could be done to speed up the integration into the workforce of the growing numberof recent immigrants. This would allow their important contribution to the workforce to increasemore rapidly over time.Put it all together, and it is not much of a stretch to imagine that Canada’s labour force couldexpand by another half a million workers. To put this thought experiment into perspective, this 3 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
could increase Canada’s potential output by as much as 1.5 per cent, or about $30 billion peryear. That’s equal to a permanent increase in output of almost $1,000 per Canadian every year,even before you factor in the possible investment and productivity gains that would come withsuch an increase in labour supply. Clearly, that is a prize worth pursuing.The role of monetary policyThe central bank has no role in implementing specific policies aimed at breaking down barriers tolabour force participation. However, that does not mean we have no role to play at all. The Bankcan certainly use its monetary policy to help bring about a stronger, better functioning economywhile still pursuing our inflation-targeting goal. This is particularly important in the current phaseof the economic cycle, with demand prompting investment that can pull more people into theworkforce.Statistics Canada data show that job vacancies have been rising quickly, reaching a record470,000 last autumn. And we hear from business leaders that many of these vacancies aregoing unfilled because they cannot find workers with the right skills. To have companies lookingfor so many skilled workers is surely a sign of a strong economy. It shows the need for moretargeted education, as well as on-the-job training programs that the employer tailors to fill aspecific need.But another important way to fill job vacancies is a process that economists call labour marketchurn. Basically, churn describes the way people switch to jobs that better match their skills andexperience. Churn falls sharply during recessions, because people are less likely to take achance on a new opportunity and companies are more inclined to hold onto their skilled workers.However, in periods of strong growth and rising wages, we often see people who are alreadyemployed become more willing to leave their current position and switch to a higher-paying job.When one person takes that step, he or she leaves an opening that needs to be filled. A period ofjob switching follows, where people move into better employment. Ultimately, people who havebeen outside the labour force then see more opportunities and can be drawn back in.Of course, we will never have a perfect matching of all workers and jobs. The regional nature ofour economy means the perfect job to match a person’s skills and experience might bethousands of kilometres away. Further, there are still too many barriers that prevent workers inone province from moving to a job in another province.Labour market churn is a highly complex process that is difficult to predict. So is the creation ofnew economic supply through investment prompted by strong demand or new firm creation. Butit should be clear that there are likely to be significant economic benefits associated with allowingthe economy to find its way to a higher, more productive economic equilibrium, if this can happenwithin our inflation-targeting regime. We cannot know in advance how far the capacity-buildingprocess can go, but we have an obligation to allow it to occur.This is why the Bank has been careful to explain that it cannot take a mechanical approach topolicy in this context, even though we believe that interest rates are likely to move higher overtime. In fact, we have described this as a risk-management process. If the economy builds moresupply than usual, that will put downside risk on inflation; if less, that will create upside risk toinflation, and it is our job to balance those risks.Of course, these are not the only issues we are watching closely. My colleague, DeputyGovernor Tim Lane, listed many of these in his progress report speech last week. The issuesinclude heightened uncertainty about future US trade policies, changes in inflation dynamics,wage behaviour and the impact of interest rates on the economy, given high levels of householddebt. In this situation, we will remain cautious in considering future policy adjustments anddependent on incoming data to guide our assessments. 4 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
The future of workSo far, I have been talking about the untapped potential in today’s economy. Let me now say afew words about the future of work, and what theory and history suggest may be in store.We are at the start of what has been called the fourth industrial revolution. The integration ofdigital technologies in virtually every part of our lives is just getting started. Like all revolutions inhuman history, we can expect it to cause some significant dislocations. And like all economicprogress since the beginning of time, it will involve creative destruction.The first industrial revolution saw the introduction of the steam engine and led to the first factoriesand urbanization. This spawned the Luddite movement—textile workers who fought against thetechnology that threatened their livelihood.In the second industrial revolution, electricity and the internal combustion engine changed theway goods could move around the globe. Countries began to specialize more, and internationaltrade became key to connecting supply and demand.In the third industrial revolution, advances in computing power and communications technologyled to breakthroughs in the way information could be stored, processed and transmitted. Theassociated advances in global logistics enabled even greater specialization in production—thedevelopment of global supply chains—making the world even more dependent on trade toconnect supply and demand.Importantly, all of these revolutions caused hardship for people in industries that were disrupted.Yet, the enormous gains in productivity and the advances these new technologies spawned formthe basis of our modern economy.Whenever a groundbreaking technology arrives, a predictable pattern follows. The technologydisrupts existing industries, leading to job losses. Governments can, and do, have in placesafety-net policies to cushion the blow for people directly affected. And, as I mentioned before,new companies will exploit these technologies to create new types of jobs and entirely newindustries. The hockey-stick growth and productivity gains help boost income, which flowsthroughout the entire economy. This in turn increases demand in every sector of the economy,creating new job opportunities and raising living standards.Let me give an example from Canada’s history. At Confederation, 151 years ago, about half ofworking Canadians were employed in agriculture in one form or another. As new technologiesdisrupted farming, fewer people were needed on the farm, yet farm output continued to expand.The same technologies created new opportunities for those who moved to cities. By the 1920s,only one-third of Canadians were still involved in agriculture. By the 1950s, that figure was downto 15 per cent and, today, it is less than 2 per cent. And, yet, agricultural output has more thantripled over the past century.Here at the start of the fourth industrial revolution, new applications are creating jobs that wereunimaginable just a few years ago. When most of us were kids, we did not dream about what wewould create with a 3-D printer, because 3-D printing had not been invented yet. Ten years ago,there were no smartphone app developers, or cloud computing engineers or social mediamanagers.It is human nature to focus on the negative. So, when we think about autonomous vehicles, forexample, people tend to dwell on the jobs that will begin to disappear for truckers and taxi drivers.Clearly, governments need to support people who bear the brunt of technological change.At the same time, we need to remember the positives—all the new jobs that will be created andthe people who will be needed to build these vehicles, to write their software, to maintain the 5 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
fleets once they are built, to redesign and construct roads, to coordinate traffic and so on. Whatis more, truly creative entrepreneurs will think about new ways to apply this technology, forexample, to boost independence and productivity for many people living with disabilities.Beyond this, we also need to remember the income-generating effect of these new jobs. Thehigher incomes that are generated create demand, not just in the new sectors but also for othergoods and services throughout the economy, including such ordinary things as housing andhome renovations. This income-generating effect is likely one factor behind Canada’s strong jobgrowth last year in sectors such as manufacturing and construction—jobs where the requiredskills are not too far removed from those required in sectors of the economy that are beingdisrupted.The bottom line is this: throughout history, technological advances have always led to risingproductivity and living standards, and they have always created more jobs than they destroyed.This is not to understate the pain that disruption can cause for individuals—we owe it to them towork hard to create pathways forward, so all can participate in the evolving economy.ConclusionIt is time for me to conclude.The Bank of Canada has plenty of reasons to care about the state of the labour market. It hasbecome a good deal healthier over the past year or so, but we still see some slack remaining.We expect to see increased investment—both in existing and brand new companies—as well aslabour market churn create more supply through higher productivity and employment. However,these uncertain processes entail both upside and downside risks to inflation, and our monetarypolicy remains particularly data-dependent as we balance those risks.Of course, we are watching issues other than the state of the labour market and the evolution ofsupply. Yet, even with all the unknowns, there is good reason to be optimistic about the Canadianeconomy. These are exciting times. New opportunities, new technologies and new industries areall waiting right around the corner. The students here today will be the ones who will shape thefuture, with the tools developed through their imagination and ingenuity. I cannot wait to see howit turns out.I would like to thank Russell Barnett for his help with this speech. 6 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
Salvatore Rossi: Which new frontiers in banking?Speaking notes by Mr Salvatore Rossi, Senior Deputy Governor of the Bank of Italy and Presidentof the Institute for the Supervision of Insurance (IVASS), at the 2018 Conference on "NewFrontiers in Banking: from Corporate Governance to Risk Management", Faculty of Economics,La Sapienza University, Rome, 16 March 2018.*   *   *In the banking business, the concept of frontier – and its crossing – can be intended in severalways.Let’s start with size. After the global financial crisis, banking systems in the large advancedeconomies have undergone a substantial consolidation process. The number of small bankshas decreased; concentration ratios – measured as the share of banking system assets heldby the largest five banks – have increased both in the euro area and in the United States. In Italy,at the end of 2016, the share of total assets accounted for by the five largest banks amounted to43 percent.This process is still under way, and will presumably continue in the foreseeable future.It’s not always a good thing. From a financial stability perspective, big banks should ideally behighly diversified and less exposed to idiosyncratic risks. However, the Lehman crisis provedthat big banks may end up holding very similar portfolios, in which case they might becomemore vulnerable to adverse systemic shocks. In other words, the reduction in idiosyncratic riskmight come at the cost of an increase in total risk on their balance sheets.Furthermore, the bigger a bank, the greater the “implicit subsidy” it enjoys in terms of higherlikelihood to be rescued in case of distress, either being bailed out or, in Europe, resolved ratherthan liquidated. It’s the well-known “too-big-to-fail” problem.All in all, big banks are not necessarily safer from a systemic perspective. It’s something thatshould be evaluated case by case.What about business models? Another “new frontier” for the bank of the future could be afundamental change in its business model, for instance from traditional retail banking to assetmanagement or corporate/investment banking.The issue there is profitability, and it has very much to do with rules. The current weakness inbank profitability, particularly in Europe, not only depends on macroeconomic cyclical factors,which were very unfavorable in past years, but also on the new requirements in terms of capitaland liquidity, that were the regulators’ response to the excessive risk-taking of the pre-crisis era.I don’t think the banking sector could ever be back to the double-digit returns of the past 20years. It may rather converge to a “new normal” with more low- consuming-capital activities. Inany case, a sustained profitability must require cutting operational costs, as well as a lot ofinvestment in new technologies.New technologies are probably the most important new frontier for banks, and I will dwell onthem in a minute.Let me first widen the topic of this roundtable a little bit, to the financial system at large. Banksaren’t the only financial players, nor should they be, in perspective, the largely dominant ones, atleast in countries like Italy.In this country the financial structure is already evolving, though at a still moderate pace. Non- 1 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
financial firms, especially the biggest ones, are now using equity and bond markets much morethan in the past for their financial needs, although still not enough, in my opinion.  But in Italy we may need not just more markets. Non-bank intermediaries, such as private equityand venture capital funds, are still underrepresented in the financial landscape.However, from a prudential point of view there’s a delicate balance to strike between a morearticulated financial structure, which is desirable per se, and the need not to give “shadowbanking” unlimited freedom. We are working, together with our colleagues in the worldregulatory circles, on such a difficult puzzle.Let me conclude with some words on the third and most important new frontier that I’vementioned before for the financial system: technology. Again I’ll look at this issue from aregulatory point of view.We are observing how digitalisation is already changing the financial business. Although manyof our intermediaries, particularly the smallest ones, are lagging behind in the process ofdigitalisation, the road ahead is clear: we are talking about technologies that are wellconsolidated, they are not “new” anymore.Fintech firms are a step forward. In a stricter sense, Fintech firms are new players aiming atcrowding out traditional intermediaries like banks. Banks are reacting in different ways: someare buying Fintech start-ups and trying to internalize them in their business models, others areestablishing partnership agreements and externalizing part of their production function, othersare trying to internally develop Fintech-like business units. We don’t know which approach willprevail.What we know is that part of the intermediation chain and of the payment system is movingoutside the traditional financial ecosystem. Incumbents are feeling the pressure of thesechanges.The potential for efficiency gains, increased accessibility to financial services and lower end-user costs are great, but great opportunities always come with great risks. Safeguardingagainst risks without curbing innovation is the challenge regulators will face in the near future.Existing rules have been designed for traditional activities and intermediaries. It is more andmore difficult to understand how, when, and to which agents they can be applied.The temptation to over-regulate, minimizing the risks at the expenses of innovation, may begreat. This, however, would not only be against the  public interest, but also probablyimpossible, given the liquid nature of innovation. What regulators may reasonably do is to adopta pragmatic, flexible approach, coordinatedacross jurisdictions and based on a continuous dialogue with the industry, as was recentlysuggested by the FSB.For the time being, approaches and stages of development vary considerably acrossjurisdictions. The majority of supervisors are still in the early stages of understanding the newphenomena.Continued sharing of supervisory practices in this area is crucial. 2 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
 I would like to thank Grahame Johnson, Alexandra Lai and Harri Vikstedt for their help with this speech.  Not for publication before March 22, 2018 14:45 Eastern Time       Remarks by Carolyn A. Wilkins Senior Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada Rotman School of Management conference “Are We Ready  For the Next Financial Crisis?” Toronto, Ontario March 22, 2018   Financial Stability: Taking Care of Unfinished Business  A clear lesson of history is that a “sine qua non” for sustained economic recovery following a financial crisis is a thoroughgoing repair of the financial system. (Former Chair of the US Federal Reserve System Janet Yellen, 2009)1    Introduction Here we are, 10 years after the financial crisis, still tallying the costs, studying causes and drawing lessons from it.  The outcome would have been worse in 2008 and the following years had it not been for the swift and coordinated efforts of policy-makers around the world to boost demand and repair the financial system. Even so, it has been estimated that the crisis cost the global economy 62 million jobs and more than US$10 trillion in lost output.2 Although Canada’s recession was less deep than experienced in countries at the epicentre of the crisis, it was still painful for many people.  It took more than a decade—and a series of aftershocks—to get to a place where we feel that emergency measures, such as ultra-low interest rates, may at last no longer be needed.                                                   1 J.

2   While uncertainty about trade polices continues to cloud the global and Canadian outlooks, for a central banker like me, this moment feels like it has been a long time coming. We responded to contagion from abroad with aggressive monetary policy actions. We have estimated that without these actions, the recession might have been a year longer and an additional half a million jobs would have been lost.3 We worked with our Canadian and international colleagues—and some of you here—to put critical programs in place to ensure liquidity in core funding markets during the crisis. And, we co-operated on a series of global financial reforms. Having been personally involved on several fronts, I know just how much of a collective effort this was. Many of you here today have worked hard in your own institutions to comply with new rules and shore up risk management. We have all accomplished a lot. But, let’s face it, the job is still not done. Winston Churchill once said, “All men make mistakes, but only wise men learn from their mistakes.” So, it is wise to have conferences like this one, where we can continue to reflect on what went wrong. That is why I am pleased to be here; I would like to thank the organizers for the invitation. The experts who spoke before me gave us insights into the genesis of the crisis and the subsequent lessons. My intention is to push the conversation forward and spark discussion in three areas where I believe we have unfinished business: 1. Understanding the role of monetary policy in financial stability—if there is one thing we have learned since the turn of the century, it is that price stability does not guarantee financial stability.  2. Keeping policy current as risks to the system evolve—leverage and liquidity are important usual suspects, but the trickiest part may be understanding the risks that stem from interconnectedness in an ecosystem that is changing rapidly. 3. Being ready for when things go wrong—being well prepared will help keep the financial damage to a minimum, especially for people who did not take the risk in the first place. Central banks, along with other authorities and financial system participants, have a strong role to play in all these areas.  Monetary policy cannot do it all Let me start with the role of monetary policy in financial stability. Monetary stability—low, stable and predictable inflation—is at the heart of a solid macroeconomy and financial stability. Since the Bank of Canada adopted its inflation-control target in 1991, there has been a reduction in the variability of economic growth by more than one-third and in unemployment by 40 per cent, even when accounting for the crisis. This has been particularly beneficial for younger people and workers with a lower level of                                                  3 These estimates were produced by running a simulation with ToTEM, the Bank of Canada’s main policy model.  
3   education, who tend to have more precarious employment.4 Successful inflation targeting in Canada and elsewhere is considered one of the factors behind this “Great Moderation,” together with some helpful changes to structural policies and a little good luck.5 We know that many factors contributed to the crisis—including inadequate regulatory safeguards and global macroeconomic imbalances. That said, the crisis made clear what some economists had previously suspected: price stability alone is not enough to ensure financial stability and could, in some circumstances, contribute to the buildup of financial vulnerabilities.6 Central bankers were of course already aware that vulnerabilities could build up via the traditional channel of monetary policy that works through asset prices and credit markets. But we learned the hard way that another channel—the risk-taking channel—could be a powerful amplification mechanism. In fact, it is now evident that low interest rates encourage people not only to borrow more but also to make riskier investments to get better returns.7   Hindsight is 20/20, but we can all think of an episode that fits the risk-taking narrative. For me, it is the substantial rise in the issuance of structured credit in the mid-2000s that facilitated a huge increase in subprime mortgages and leveraged buyouts driven by private equity.8 The unfinished business here is coming to a consensus about what monetary policy can and should do about financial vulnerabilities, and about how monetary policy fits into the rest of the policy framework. Clearly microprudential and macroprudential regulations are on the front lines, and inflation targeting is the central bank’s primary mission. Nevertheless, we take financial stability into account in our decisions, consistent with                                                  4 For estimates by demographic group of the benefits of reduced cyclical variability, see Table 2 in T.

4   our risk-management approach.9 The current situation offers an example. With high levels of household debt and the Canadian economy operating close to capacity, monetary policy actions to achieve the inflation target and support financial stability are currently complementary. The Bank of Canada has underscored that there is nonetheless a fine balance to be struck here: while moving too slowly would allow more time for financial vulnerabilities to build, moving too quickly could have outsized effects, given the high level of household indebtedness.  There may be, in different situations, a case for taking longer to bring inflation back to target than the usual six to eight quarters.10 That was something we considered in late 2013. Inflation was running below target and the economy had excess capacity, which might have warranted an easing in policy. However, we judged that the best course of action was to leave our policy rate at 1 per cent to avoid exacerbating financial vulnerabilities in the household sector, while still returning inflation to target over a reasonable time horizon.  There is still debate about how best to integrate financial stability considerations into monetary policy. I would like to highlight a couple of promising avenues to help advance this discussion. The first is to invest in policy models that do a better job of capturing the interlinkages between the financial system and the economy, such as those that can lead to defaults on loans, asset fire sales and other real-world events. I don’t think any model will ever be perfect, so we will always be operating with a heavy dose of uncertainty. Yet, this research will yield insightful answers to the question of how monetary policy should respond to a buildup of financial vulnerabilities, if at all.11  The second avenue is to strengthen our framework for macroprudential policies, which are better suited to target financial system risks. Taking a page from the inflation-targeting regime, there is a benefit to clarity about objectives, governance and tools for the job.12 The focus in Canada has understandably been on macroprudential policies related to household finance to improve the quality of debt and limit its growth. Many of these policies, such as recent changes to mortgage underwriting rules, are aimed at increasing the resilience of the financial system on an ongoing basis. Authorities could use other tools to dampen financial cycles and boost the resilience of the banking system when bank credit has been growing rapidly. An example is the countercyclical capital buffer introduced as part of the Basel III reforms. The Bank of England has put                                                  9 See S. S. Poloz, “Integrating Uncertainty and Monetary Policy-Making: A Practitioner’s Perspective,” Bank of Canada Staff Discussion Paper No. 2014-6 (October 2014). 10 For more on the role of monetary policy in counteracting financial imbalances and the related case for a flexible target horizon, see J.

5   such countercyclical measures in place, and the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) is working on implementing similar measures in Canada.13 Despite the promise of macroprudential policy, we need to be humble about what we know in practice. As we gain experience with these tools, in Canada and abroad, we should sharpen our understanding of their effectiveness. And we should continue to strengthen the framework in which monetary policy and macroprudential policies reinforce each other.14  A solid framework is essential to reduce the likelihood of undue pressure for monetary policy to lean against the build-up of financial vulnerabilities. Interest rates are a blunt tool, so using them to achieve financial stability could have suboptimal outcomes from the perspectives of both monetary policy and financial stability. That is why it is imperative that academics and central banks focus our efforts on a number of areas. At the Bank of Canada, we are exploring new sources of microdata to better understand vulnerabilities and monitor the effectiveness of macroprudential tools and monetary policy. We are developing policy models that have relevant institutional features and rich heterogeneity in income and wealth to get a better handle on the efficacy and impact of macroprudential policy tools.  Even with improvements in these areas, we know that monetary and macroprudential policies will be insufficient to fully safeguard financial stability.  Keeping policy current as risks evolve This brings me to the second area of unfinished business, which is that our regulatory and supervisory practices need to stay current as risks evolve. The key issues that got us into the crisis—leverage, illiquidity and interconnectedness—are still the right ones to look at. We have taken great steps to identify, manage and mitigate these vulnerabilities in financial institutions. Basel III is largely in place globally, which has tightened banks’ capital and liquidity requirements and set a limit on leverage. We have enhanced bank resolution tools and shifted the largest portions of over-the-counter derivatives to central                                                  13 For more information on the Bank of England’s countercyclical bank capital buffers, see “The Financial Policy Committee’s Approach to Setting the Countercyclical Capital Buffer” (April 2016). 14 For more information on the nexus between monetary and macroprudential policy, see S.

6   counterparties (CCPs). And, many of the weaknesses in market-based financing that made the system vulnerable before the crisis have been addressed.15  The job is never done, however, because risk is constantly shifting. We learned from the crisis that, while trouble is a complex brew, financial innovation is usually a key ingredient. Financial innovation has not slowed since the crisis. It can often help improve our financial system, yet it can also carry risks. That’s why risk management needs to become more nimble. A couple of areas worry me right now, and they need concerted attention. Both relate to interconnectedness and trust in the system. My first concern is one that I know is shared by many here in relation to your own activities: cyber risk. In fact, a recent survey conducted by Risk.net found that disruption in information technology leads the list of the top 10 operational risks for 2018.16 When it comes to cyber risk, and many other operational risks, we are all connected. Now, some new technologies, such as cloud computing, may be safer than legacy systems. Yet cyber risk is heightened in other ways because of an increasing number of points of access to core parts of the financial system and the growing sophistication of those launching cyber attacks. It is part of our digital world.  The Bank of Canada is responsible for oversight of critical financial market infrastructures (FMIs). We already impose strong requirements to support the stability of these infrastructures, such as payment systems and CCPs, and we are working to further contain and respond to cyber risks. The systems that underpin all financial transactions in our economy are highly interconnected, and a cyber attack on one could quickly propagate and cause major disruptions.17 The costs might not stop there. Households and businesses typically do not think about these systems because they operate smoothly behind the scenes. However, trust in core systems could be undermined if participants felt that their information or assets were vulnerable. That is why we are working with Payments Canada and the six largest Canadian banks to reduce the chance of a serious cyber event, and to mitigate the impact and recover quickly if such an event were to materialize.   My second area of concern is related to the rapid pace of financial innovation. Such innovation can bring lower costs and increase the range of investment strategies. Exchange-traded products, for example, offer investors relatively easy access to illiquid, complex strategies. The issue is that some of these strategies rely on derivative                                                  15 Financial Stability Board, “Assessment of Shadow Banking Activities, Risks and the Adequacy of Post-Crisis Policy Tools to Address Financial Stability Concerns,” July 3, 2017. 16 See S. Marlin, “Top 10 Op Risks: IT Disruption Heads 2018 Poll,” Risk.net (February 21, 2018). 17 For more on cyber risk, see S. S. Poloz, “Three Things Keeping Me Awake at Night” (speech to the Canadian Club Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, December 14, 2017).  
7   structures that have counterparty and collateral risks.18 These products can be surprisingly troublesome if they are not well understood, yet become popular, particularly with retail investors. This hearkens back to Canada’s experience with third-party asset-backed commercial paper leading up to the crisis. A recent—albeit more contained—example is inverse volatility exchange-traded products. Many investors were attracted to the high returns earned on these products in the low-volatility environment of recent years. At the beginning of February, however, these products lost nearly all their value in one day when US equity volatility spiked.19 The good news is that markets were resilient to this event. The unease is because, aside from the obvious suitability issue, many were unaware of the extent of the underlying interlinkages between products, in this case, leveraged long and short volatility products. These interlinkages, or dynamics, worked to amplify the volatility by creating a one-way market in VIX futures.20 Even further along the risk spectrum are private crypto assets. I do not refer to the existing products as currency because they do not perform any of the key functions of money. While activity may be too small right now to be systemic, at some point they could have financial stability implications. The crypto world is moving fast, and is largely unchecked. This certainly raises concerns about investor protection, market integrity and the use of crypto assets in illegal activities. In fact, there is evidence of widespread use of some crypto assets for money laundering and other illegal activities, and some rather spectacular incidents of theft and fraud have occurred. And we have seen significant financial risk, given the volatility and illiquidity of the assets.  Authorities should work toward a coherent set of policies for crypto assets that is aligned internationally. This strategy will need to cover risks in both cash and derivatives products, as well as in the related ecosystem. The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) launched work on offerings of crypto assets last year, noting that—where appropriate—they are treating these as securities.21 I just returned from the G20 meetings in Buenos Aires and am pleased that the G20 is increasing its focus in this area, given the global nature of these products.22                                                   18 See I. Foucher and K. Gray, “Exchange-Traded Funds: Evolution of Benefits, Vulnerabilities and Risks,” Bank of Canada Financial System Review (December 2014): 37–46.  19 These ETPs formed part of a larger “short vol” trade, which before early February some estimates put as high as US$2 trillion, and which allowed retail investors to access complex and leveraged trading strategies that were typically done only by sophisticated investors.

8   My bottom line here is that we need a sharpened focus on consumer and investor protection, and market integrity. These are foundational elements of a sound financial system because they support trust. Plan for when things go wrong The last area I want to highlight is readiness: we need to be prepared for when things go wrong. It is impossible to be rid of all risks, and undesirable as well. A modern economy advances because people work hard and are willing to stick their necks out. That means that some risk will materialize. That said, the system should be able to withstand some failures without imposing huge costs on those who did not take the risk in the first place.  We have made a lot of progress in a number of areas, but more needs to be done. For example, we identified the financial institutions and FMIs that could have outsized impacts on the financial system if they failed, and we are subjecting them to more stringent regulation and supervision, including recovery and resolution planning.23   Central banks and international policy organizations have also worked to develop early-warning indicators of risks to the global financial system.24 While these are helpful as a starting point, we need to recognize their limitations, particularly if they rely on deviations from historical trends or threshold values. That is why it is important to push the analysis further to properly gauge the risk. Stress tests are an excellent way to help us understand what could happen if financial institutions were subject to adverse events, such as a steep house price decline or a Brexit vote. They also provide practical information about what might be needed to withstand and recover from these events. The Bank of Canada works with other organizations, such as OSFI and the International Monetary Fund, to conduct regular stress-testing exercises of financial institutions and to improve our modelling techniques.25  The unfinished business here is that models used for stress testing capture mainly first-round effects, with limited ability to identify spillovers that we know can end up being even more important. For example, while the Bank’s current framework does capture second-round effects that could come from interbank exposures and asset fire sales, it could be improved. The Bank, and others who conduct stress tests, could introduce                                                  23 The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has developed quantitative metrics for identifying global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) and a set of principles (no quantitative metrics) for assessing domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs): “Global Systemically Important Banks: Updated Assessment Methodology and the Higher Loss Absorbency Requirement” (July 2013) and “A Framework for Dealing with Domestic Systemically Important Banks” (October 2012). 24 For example, see Bank for International Settlements, “Early Warning Indicators of Banking Crises: Expanding the Family” (March 2018); and T. Duprey and T. Roberts, “A Barometer of Canadian Financial System Vulnerabilities,” Bank of Canada Staff Analytical Note No. 2017-24 (December 2017).  25 K. Anand, G. Bédard-Pagé and V.

9   behavioural aspects, such as the reactions of bank managers and other financial market participants, and feedback to the real economy. This would require mapping a broader range of interconnections among financial players, which is not a trivial exercise. We would also need to keep this mapping fresh by considering changes in the financial system that might affect the results. An example would be potential changes in the stickiness of retail deposits in an environment of open banking.  Of course, it’s not all about banks. Stress-testing frameworks have been designed for CCPs to test their capacity to absorb losses stemming from the default of a participant. More work is being done here as well. Many CCPs have clearing members in common, and so international standard-setting bodies are developing a framework for supervisory stress tests of multiple CCPs across jurisdictions. We know that being well prepared will increase the odds that financial institutions will recover from stress events; we also know that recovery is not always possible. Effective resolution regimes and credible plans are needed to resolve systemically important financial institutions if they fail. Together with other members of the Financial Stability Board, Canada has committed to establishing effective resolution regimes for its systemically important banks (D-SIBs) and FMIs.  As part of this effort, Canada introduced the legislative framework for a bail-in regime to ensure that people who invest in long-term bank-issued debt, along with equity holders, share in the financial burden of resolving systemically important banks.26 Aside from protecting the taxpayer, this kind of regime will help avoid adverse implications for the distribution of wealth that can follow a bailout.27 It will also support market discipline on banks in good times.28   Development of the rest of the framework is also under way. Canadian banks are working hard with the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation on their resolution plans. These plans are particularly complicated for those with significant cross-border activities, because home and host regulatory authorities need to develop a clearer sense of how financial institutions with global footprints would collaborate in stressful times. With respect to Canada’s systemically important FMIs, this year’s federal budget included plans to implement a resolution framework, although it still needs to be operationalized. Rest assured, we will not be satisfied until all these plans meet an appropriate standard.                                                    26 For details, see “Backgrounder: Regulations to Implement the Bank Recapitalization (Bail-in) Regime,” Department of Finance Canada (June 2017). 27 This cost is analyzed in J. Schroth, “Financial Crisis Interventions,” Bank of Canada Staff Working Paper No. 2016-29 (June 2016). 28 See P. P. Mora, “The ‘Too Big to Fail’ Subsidy in Canada: Some Estimates,” Bank of Canada Staff Working Paper No. 2018-9 (February 2018).  
10   Conclusion It’s time to wrap up. Janet Yellen said in 2009 that an imperative “for sustained economic recovery following a financial crisis is a thoroughgoing repair of the financial system.” On this front, we have accomplished much over the past decade, and we are now reaping the benefits.  They might not be durable, though, unless we focus on some unfinished business: refining our understanding of the role of monetary policy in supporting financial stability, keeping regulatory and supervisory policies current as risks evolve, and planning for recovery and resolution when things go wrong. The Bank of Canada is committed to playing a strong role in all of these areas, both domestically and at international tables. And let us remember, whether it is through our own financial decisions, our advice to policy-makers or our policy actions, we all play a role in the health of the financial system, and in the trust that people place in it.           
Øystein Olsen: Does Norway save too much?Speech by Mr Øystein Olsen, Governor of Norges Bank (Central Bank of Norway), at thePeterson Institute for International Economics, Washington DC, 22 March 2018.*   *   *Accompanying slides of the speech.INTRODUCTIONFirst, let me thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today. I am very happy to visit thePeterson Institute.Norway is a small, open economy which was transformed by the discovery of oil on ourcontinental shelf almost 50 years ago. Back in 1970, the year after the first discovery, incomelevels were relatively low compared with other western countries. That picture has changedcompletely.Lower oil prices in recent years have reduced the relative income level somewhat, but measuredby GDP per capita, Norway still ranks among the richest countries in the world.Graph: GDP per capitaNatural resource discoveries have been identified as a curse for some countries. For Norway, ithas been a blessing. We have managed to transform oil and gas resources into real andfinancial assets. Luck has been supplemented with what I dare claim is a sensible handling ofthe resources. At an early stage, it was concluded that the resources belong to the Norwegianpeople. Large savings in recent years means that also future generations will benefit from therevenues.Graph: The petroleum fund mechanismDirect government participation in the industry and an extraordinary tax rate for oil companies,currently at 78 percent, ensure that most of the resource rents flow into government coffers.All the revenue is channelled to the Government Pension Fund Global. The fund’s capital isinvested abroad. The annual transfers from the fund to the fiscal budget are guided by the fiscalrule, which stipulates that on average over the cycle spending must be limited to the expectedreal return on the fund – currently estimated at 3 percent.The general view in Norway is that the management of our natural resource wealth has been asuccess. The OECD and the IMF have commended the framework. Still, there is an ongoingdebate on whether current spending is too high. Some argue that the planned consumptionprofile takes too little account of future obligations, in particular pension liabilities. Others claimthat the estimates of the expected real return on the fund’s capital are too optimistic.Bergsten and Gagnon (2017) and Gagnon (2018) present a different view. They point to highcurrent account surpluses over a number of years and argue that Norway instead spends toolittle. Hence my presentation’s title – does Norway save too much?I will proceed by giving a few general perspectives on global current account imbalances. I willthen turn to the question of how much oil producers should save – and the reasons for highsaving in Norway.Graph: Outline 12 1 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
WHY A SURPLUS OR DEFICIT?The international capital market allows countries to decouple the size of savings frominvestments. The ability to run current account surpluses and deficits at different times facilitatesa globally efficient capital allocation. In addition, it may help absorb country-specific shocks.Deficits allow countries to finance productive investments. Surpluses can generate higherreturns than those available on domestic investments. And the possibility to smooth consumptionis generally a benefit.Graph: Current account balance for NorwayNorway is a prime example. Our oil history started with the country running significant deficits,enabling large investments without the need to cut consumption correspondingly. Deficits peakedat close to 12 percent of GDP in the 1970s, when the first investments in the oil industry weremade. Since then, we have mainly run surpluses, but our net international investment positionturned positive as late as in the mid-1990s, a quarter of a century after production began on theNorwegian continental shelf.Graph: Current account balancesGlobal current account imbalances have increased since the late 1990s, as can be seen in thisgraph. If deficits persist over time, the financing of the debt can be challenging. High capitalmobility increases the vulnerability of high-debt countries. Unbalanced developments canundermine support for open trade and flexible markets, in turn also hurting surplus countries. Inaddition, both high deficits and significant surpluses may reflect policy and structural distortionsthat could hamper growth.A current account deficit or surplus can thus from both an individual-country and globalperspective be either desirable or excessive, driven by distorted policies. To judge a givensituation, we must therefore consider the fundamentals behind the imbalance.For producers of non-renewable resources, it is important to remember that although extractionof a depletable resource is counted as income in the national accounts, these revenues are of aspecial kind. It would in many ways be more meaningful to view them as transformation of wealth– from natural resources underground to financial assets abroad.We would expect such producers to run substantial current account surpluses during theproduction period. As the graph illustrates, this has also been the case, in particular in the 2000s,when oil prices were high. In recent years these countries as a group have actually been indeficit, while Norway has had a small surplus, barely visible in the graph.HOW MUCH SHOULD OIL PRODUCERS SAVE?Exactly how much producers of non-renewable resources should save is a more complicatedquestion. One potential yardstick is that savings should be sufficient to avoid the so-called “Dutchdisease”. The phrase was originally coined to describe the strong decline of the manufacturingsector in the Netherlands following the exploitation of natural gas resources in the 1960s and1970s.The classic paper by Corden and Neary (1982) describes the key mechanisms behind thisdevelopment. They describe two effects in an economy experiencing a boom in an extractiveindustry, like oil or natural gas.The first effect is the spending effect. An oil discovery will increase export revenues, allowinghigher imports over time. Normally, demand for non-tradable goods will also increase. The non-tradable goods sector will require more domestic resources.3 2 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
Graph: Labour market in a three-sector modelAs a result of higher labour demand from the non-tradable sector, the general wage level willincrease, and the non-tradeable sector will expand at the expense of the two tradable sectors.Graph: “Spending effect”But this is only half of the story. The second part is the resource movement effect. Also the oilrelated-sector will demand more labour. As a result, wages will move up further, and themanufacturing sector will shrink even more.Graph: “Resource movement effect”This crowding-out of manufacturing is unavoidable if the benefits of the oil resources are to beenjoyed. But the process may go too far. The economy may find itself in a difficult situation whenresources are exhausted. The structural changes in the economy have to be reversed. Workerswho become unemployed must find new jobs in manufacturing. This could be quite challenging.It is at this stage you can really assess whether a resource economy has escaped the “Dutchdisease” or not.Gagnon (2018) argues that the necessary adjustment costs will be minimised if spending followsthe permanent income principle, i.e. the expected real return of the resource wealth should bespent every year. On this background he claims that Norway has saved too much and thatspending should rather have been based on a modified version of the permanent incomeprinciple.REASONS FOR HIGH SAVING IN NORWAYThe Norwegian fiscal rule implies a more cautious spending path than the permanent incomerule. The government spends the expected return on its current financial assets, which issignificantly lower than total oil and gas wealth.Graph: Oil and gas revenues and government spendingThe fiscal rule implies that real spending will increase as long as production continues, i.e. untilall oil and gas resources are transformed into financial wealth. As the economy grows, spendingas a share of mainland GDP will nevertheless fall slowly. This is illustrated in the graph.The graph also illustrates that we have been able to cut through the very large, but temporaryincome flows at the beginning of the present century. Since 2016, government spending hasexceeded the net cash flow from the oil sector. This means that we are running a primary deficitand will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Currently, the transfer from the fund equals8 percent of mainland GDP.Eventually, as delayed consumption increases accumulated returns, spending according to thefiscal rule will also surpass the current estimate of the permanent income. The real issue is thusa question of timing.Has this spending profile been too conservative, and the increase in consumption delayed for toolong, as Bergsten and Gagnon claim? My brief answer is no. My first argument is that theconclusion to spend the permanent income does not take into account the resource movementeffects discussed above. But also intergenerational concerns, uncertainty and considerationsabout political processes may favour a more cautious spending rule. I will address these issuesin turn in more detail in the following.Graph: Arguments for higher saving 3 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
Resource movementAs described in the seminal paper by Corden and Neary, a resource economy is affected bystrong structural changes also due to increased demand for labour and capital from theextraction industries. Eventually, demand from the oil-related sector will decline, and it will benecessary to reverse a downsizing of manufacturing. To avoid “Dutch disease” effects, spendingshould be well below the permanent income level during the extraction period.Let me shed some light on the direct demand from the companies that operate on the Norwegiancontinental shelf.Graph: The Norwegian Troll A platform and some other structuresCrude oil and natural gas are extracted from large depths below the sea level. In particular,capital expenditure is high. The platform “Troll A” provides a striking example. If most of it was notcovered by water, it would dwarf some other, well-known structures. In the years prior to therecent oil price fall, oil companies invested about as much as all businesses in the mainlandeconomy combined. Total oil-sector demand amounted to more than 13 percent of mainlandGDP in 2014. This is well above current government spending of oil and gas revenues, and alsomore than the estimate of the permanent income.Graph: Demand from the oil and gas sector and government spending of oil/gas revenuesIt has been estimated that one in nine jobs in the Norwegian economy was related to oil sectordemand in 2014. The step-wise development of oil and gas reserves in the North Sea hashelped to create a supply industry that has become world leading in special areas.The downturn following the oil price decline in 2014 has highlighted the oil-dependence of theNorwegian economy. As oil-sector demand plummeted, the blow to the economy was cushionedby a substantial increase in government spending. This room for manoeuvre in fiscal policy wasprovided by the significant savings in preceding years. Without it, the recent downturn could havebecome much more painful.Intergenerational concernsGraph: Old-age dependency ratioAllow me to move on to another argument for relatively high saving: the intergenerationalchallenges facing the Norwegian economy. Like many other countries, we must cope with thechallenges associated with an ageing population. As we have developed a more extensivewelfare state than many other countries, the impact on public finances is significant. The pensionsystem is basically pay-as-you-go and health care is also funded by the government. An ageingpopulation will therefore weigh quite heavily on public finances.In the 1990s and 2000s the demographic trend was different. During those years, the share ofthe population 67 years or older actually declined, mirroring low birth rates between the two worldwars. Since around 2010 the long-term trend towards a higher old-age dependency ratio hasresumed. Public pension costs have shot up as baby boomers have retired. The burden on thehealth and long-term care system is rather light at the moment. But this will change in thecoming years.With the alternative strategy of spending the permanent income, we would have spent more ofthe oil wealth in the 1990s and 2000s, when demographic costs for the government were low.The present fiscal rule, on the contrary, allows increased spending of oil revenue also in a periodwhere age-related costs are expected to grow much faster.45 4 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
UncertaintyA third concern related to wealth management is uncertainty. Both oil price movements and theresource base are uncertain. Returns on foreign financial investments also fluctuate.Graph: Oil priceIn 2014, we were once again reminded that future oil prices are uncertain. Prices have roughlyhalved from the peaks reached in 2011 and 2012. Still, prices are much higher than they were inthe 1990s. In 1998, the nominal price dropped to USD 10 per barrel. A decade later, oil wastrading at more than USD 100 per barrel.Graph: The current account and value added in oil and gas extractionWith oil prices closer to the historical average, current account surpluses have been reducedsubstantially in the past few years. In 2016, our surplus was less than 4 percent of GDP,including the return on the fund assets. Trade was roughly in balance. The oil price hasrebounded somewhat recently, but is not expected to reach the levels we saw a few years ago.Thus, the high Norwegian current account surpluses may belong to the past. Given theuncertainties related to petroleum wealth, a spending rule more cautious than the permanentincome rule seems to be a reasonable strategy.Political feasibilityAllow me to round off this discussion with some reflections concerning practical policy. My pointis that fiscal guidelines must be politically acceptable and understandable to the wider public.Simplicity and robustness are important concerns. Rules that are not adopted by policymakerscarry little value.The Norwegian fiscal rule was introduced in 2001, exactly 30 years after the first oil wasextracted from the Norwegian continental shelf. This illustrates that it was not straightforward toarrive at a strategy for how our natural resource wealth was going to be spent.The need to decouple current spending from current revenues was underscored early on, andpotential mechanisms were discussed, but these concerns were not reflected in actual policy. Inperiods, all the oil and gas revenues and more were spent.The fund mechanism was established in 1990, during Norway’s deepest recession in thepostwar period. At the time, it was not obvious that the fund would gain much value. Thegovernment ran budget deficits in the following years. A first deposit was made in 1996, reflectinga net fiscal surplus. From then on, the value of the fund started to increase quite rapidly. Higheroil revenues towards 2000 led to calls for higher spending. The fiscal rule was established inresponse to this development.A fiscal rule based on the permanent income from petroleum wealth would require agreement onwhat this number should be. Since 2001 we have seen large revisions in the estimatedpermanent income, as oil prices and resource estimates have changed. The future developmentof the value of the fund is also uncertain, but at least the value of the fund at a given point and theactual return from year to year are observable.It is also worth noting that the proposed rule enabled a smooth transition from the actual level ofspending at the time. In comparison, a permanent income rule would have implied a very largeincrease in spending back in 2001.In 2017 the estimated real return on the fund was revised downwards from 4 percent to 3percent. This spurred no significant debate and was largely considered more of a technicalmatter. This serves to illustrate the broad political consensus regarding the fiscal framework. The 5 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
framework has served us well for 17 years, and seems set to continue to do so.CONCLUSIONGraph: ConclusionThe Norwegian economy has benefited tremendously from the oil and gas resources. Public andprivate consumption have increased. Solid public finances have provided scope to make activeuse of fiscal policy to counter external economic shocks. The accumulated wealth in the fund isapproaching three times mainland GDP, enabling a lasting annual income contribution to futurewelfare of 6-8 percent of mainland GDP in the coming decades.The present guidelines allow temporary income flows to be transformed into permanent gains,benefiting all future generations. They are simple and robust. They take account of the effects onthe rest of the economy and on the economic policy debate.Norway’s experience serves as an example of why temporary shocks in general, and morespecifically discoveries of natural resources, justify deviations from a balanced current account.Deficits used to finance investments that generated high returns have served us well.I guess there is no such thing in the real world as an “optimal spending rule”. In the Norwegiancase, there were definitely lessons to be learned during the first two-three decades of resourcedevelopment. Still, over the years, and in particular with the present fiscal rule, I think we havestruck a reasonable balance.Thank you for your attention.Bergsten, C.F. and Gagnon, J.

Yves Mersch: Challenges facing monetary policy in the euro areaSpeech by Mr Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, tothe Schweizerisch-Deutscher Wirtschaftsclub, Frankfurt am Main, 19 March 2018.*   *   *The euro area economy is recovering even faster than expected. Many people are hopingtherefore that monetary policy will soon become again “more normal”.In that context, the procedure for exiting from our purchase programme is linked to aprecondition: that inflation moves into line with our objective in a sustainable way. We havebecome more confident that inflation is on the right track. So it’s only a question of time until wereach our goal. However, as we move in that direction we still need an expansionary monetarypolicy.But that does not mean that our specific monetary policy measures have to remain completelyunchanged. The gradual exit from the purchase programme is confronting us, however, withcertain problems: on the one hand, a too abrupt ending could lead to excessive market reactions.On the other hand, the effectiveness of the purchase programme is declining over time; the sideeffects are increasing. To mitigate these risks, we need a credible exit scenario.Background to the adjustment of the purchase programmeFirst, let us look back on our adjustment of the purchase programme. In October last year, theGoverning Council decided to reduce the purchases. On 8 March this year, the Councilconfirmed that the net purchases, currently amounting to €30 billion per month, should be madeuntil the end of September 2018. If necessary, the purchases can be extended beyond that untilthe Governing Council sees a sustainable correction of inflation in line with its definition of pricestability over the medium term.The purchase programme was adjusted because of the expected higher price pressure basedon the euro area’s strong and broad-based economic growth. Its economy has now growncontinuously for 18 quarters, with the relevant indicators pointing to continued strong growth.According to the projections made by ECB experts, the economy is expected to grow evenslightly faster in the short term than previously expected. Annual real GDP will increase by 2.4%in 2018, by 1.9% in 2019 and by 1.7% in 2020. Compared with the December 2017 projections,the prospects for real GDP growth in 2018 have been revised upwards; the outlook for the twoyears thereafter remains unchanged.Overall, the risks to the growth prospects of the euro area are regarded as being in balance.There are now global factors that could cast a shadow over the strong growth outlook.First, the new trade measures announced by the US administration. ECB estimates indicate thatthe first-round effects of the proposed measures for the euro area are likely to be slight, even inthe event of retaliation by US trading partners. The after-effects however could be stronger.Second, developments in the foreign exchange and other financial markets. In this respect, Iwould like to point out though that the most recent volatility on stock markets had little impact onother asset classes in the euro area.The strong economic growth is also having an impact on the labour market. The increase inemployment since mid-2013 – almost 7.5 million jobs – has offset the total number of jobs lostoverall during the crisis. The unemployment gap – a measure of labour market overcapacity –now seems to have closed , although it has again been revised downwards, and employment in 1 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
the euro area is higher than it has ever been.In short, our monetary policy has successfully boosted demand and returned slack resourcesback into productive use. In view of this, the path of inflation should, over the medium term,approach our inflation objective of below, but close to, 2%. And inflation is acceletating, albeitmore slowly than we would like, but more clearly than expected in October, when we decided toscale back the purchases. The increase in trust that inflation is on the right path will alsoinfluence our reaction in the future.Two additional factors play an essential role here: the first has to do with the declining impact ofour net purchases over time. The holdings are becoming steadily more important than thegrowth. The second factor relates to the link between output and inflation.In the past, a highly expansionary policy was needed to counter the economic downturn and toensure that inflation remained consistent with our definition of price stability. Headwinds reducedthe effectiveness of our monetary policy and they had to be resisted.For example, deleveraging caused a greater inclination to save, the general uncertaintydampened investments and a long period of low inflation threatened to de-anchor inflationexpectations. In addition, deflation was a real risk.These negative factors have eased during the ongoing recovery. Deflation fears have beendispelled. And the assumption is that, under these circumstances, a policy of unchangedmonetary policy is unduly expansionary.In addition, there’s the fact that the effect of the asset holdings on our balance sheet will becomegreater over time: as the size of our portfolio grows, so does the additional effect of a givenpurchase volume. As our asset holdings are high, they have become much less widely held thanat the start of our purchase programme. In this way, the relative share of our purchases on themarket and thus the effect of these purchases for each billion euro spent goes up. In otherwords, a smaller purchase volume today has the same effect as a higher purchase volume inthe past.As our asset holdings go up, so does our need to reinvest, which is why we are having toincrease our gross purchases – i.e. our net purchases in addition to our reinvestments. And thisis happening in an environment of reduced new borrowing in most of the euro area countries.Even with a lower volume of net purchases, the Eurosystem retains a significant marketpresence. It is calculated that around €167 billion of cumulative repayments will be madebetween March 2018 and February 2019.For all these reasons, we needed to adjust our monetary policy stance. We are in a position toadapt our monetary policy to the strengthening upturn in the future, without seriously harminggrowth or inflation. And the longer the recovery continues, the less the economy depends onspecial monetary policy measures.The second factor behind our decision is: how quickly will stronger demand have an impact inthe form of rising prices?The euro area is by no means the only advanced economy with robust output growth andinflation rates below historical levels. It would be too much here to cover the various attemptsmade by economists to explain this. Frankly, I find none of them particularly convincing. However,I believe that these factors should not keep us from fulfilling our task in the medium term. Wemight need a bit longer to reach our goal, but we will reach it.Let me briefly mention a theoretical explanation. The relationship between slack and inflation, thePhillips curve, has become so flat that changes in output have hardly any effects on inflation. 2 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
There are various reasons for this. Longer periods of low inflation can keep wage increasesdown, as wages are linked to inflation to a certain extent. In addition, job insecurity, digitalisationand high unemployment have led trade unions to prioritise employment over wages. And thecrisis has led to more slack on the labour market – i.e. involuntary part-time and temporary work– which has to be absorbed again before wage pressures increase.In practice, we are seeing positive signs: in fact, the difference between the overallunemployment rate and broader measures of slack on the labour market has declined somewhatover the past two years. The proportion of enterprises in manufacturing and services which saythat labour shortages are limiting their output has never been so high. The result is strongerwage growth, which is contributing to an increase in inflation. Several measures of underlyinginflation have apparently passed the turning point.I say the word “apparently” as monetary policymakers should be cautious in their judgements.The estimates of slack in the economy differ widely and are often corrected. Model results, ascomplex as they may be, should be treated with the requisite caution. In the end, assessmentsbased on experience continue to be an essential part of monetary policy decision-making.Monetary policy decisions should therefore not only be based on model results, but should alsotake into account the balance of risks. There are times when lack of action is much moredangerous than taking action and when resolute action is the most reasonable thing to do. Forexample, our purchase programme was necessary to avert the risk of deflation. However, thereare also times when the balance of risks changes fundamentally and thus monetarypolicymakers should act more carefully.Future challenges facing monetary policySo now let’s turn our attention to the future. I believe that the conditions for gradually ending theasset purchase programme are in place. However, it is up to the ECB’s Governing Council todecide on the exact timing of such a move.I’m not going to talk about the possible timing today. Let me instead touch on some of the riskswe will face in implementing our monetary policy over the coming years. These risks are likely togrow the longer our asset purchase programme continues.The first risk relates to the subsiding deflationary headwinds I have already mentioned. Could itbe that our monetary policy is suddenly too expansive? In short, because of the uncertainties andimprecisions involved in measuring slack and inflationary pressure, we might find ourselvesbehind the curve without realising it. As a result of the long and variable lags of monetary policy,we could end up with inflation above the rate consistent with our mandate.This would require a sharp correction of our monetary policy stance in years to come. Yet such acorrection of interest rates would pose risks to the financial sector. Banks could be hit hard asfunding costs rise faster than interest income on outstanding loans.But it may also be the case that the impact of these factors has already been felt, and inflationcould turn out higher than we expect over the course of the year. We would find ourselves behindthe curve – and realise it – and we would have to adjust our forward guidance.This forward guidance was put in place to stabilise market expectations and to enhance theeffectiveness of our asset purchases. We do so by indicating that interest rates will rise onlywhen we are well past the horizon for asset purchases. Prolonging asset purchases pushes outmarket expectations of a rate rise and pushes down interest rate expectations across the entirecurve. Of course, the effectiveness of our forward guidance also relies on our credibility.1 3 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
In effect, forward guidance is a promise not to react to short-term data outturns in the future soas to persuade markets to expect interest rates to remain low. But if we offer guidance thatextends too far into the future, it risks unduly tying our hands.This is a particular risk at present since, as I mentioned earlier, future increases in interest ratesneed to be gradual. Moving late could result in policy remaining too loose for too long. The timewill come this year to make further gradual adjustments to our monetary policy stance in line withour confidence in achieving our objective; market expectations are appropriate in this regard. Weshould then certainly reflect at length on the degree to which we wish to pre-commit ourselves.The second risk for monetary policy relates to the side effects of low interest rates. Ourmeasures have considerably improved financing conditions for households and firms, and haveunblocked the flow of credit.Yet easier financing conditions may encourage investment in projects that are only profitable atlow interest rates, and such loans risk turning sour as interest rates rise. Indeed, banks andinvestors may be tempted to “search for yield”, without being adequately recompensed for therisk they are taking on.Our mandate is to deliver price stability. Ensuring financial stability risks are adequatelycontained is the role of banking supervision and macroprudential policy. While there is noevidence at present of asset price bubbles in the euro area, there are some notable localisedpockets, such as in commercial real estate, and signs of “search for yield” behaviour.The financial crisis showed how such risks can interfere with the smooth operation of monetarypolicy through their effects on banks, which remain a key part of the monetary policytransmission mechanism in the euro area. We should therefore bear in mind that these risksmay make it harder for us to implement our monetary policy.There are also longer-term risks to monetary policy. Through low interest rates, monetary policymay indirectly permit inefficient firms to remain in business, and they may become so-calledzombie firms. This blunts the productivity-enhancing function of downturns to bring about“creative destruction”, whereby inefficient firms are forced out of business, freeing up resourcesto move to more efficient firms and boosting aggregate productivity. Indeed, there is evidencethat creative destruction was weaker during the recession than in previous downturns and thatzombie firms have weighed on productivity growth in some euro area countries.Productivity growth plays an important role in the conduct of monetary policy. Higher productivitygrowth spurs investment, and expectations of higher future income encourage consumers tospend more today. Thus slower productivity growth requires monetary policy to lower interestrates by more than would otherwise be necessary to stimulate the economy. Given that interestrates are currently low, and our stock of purchases is considerable, this would restrict our abilityto respond to future downward risks.I have just explained what the economic risks are. But there are also legal risks for the ECBregarding our Treaty obligations. Article 127 requires that we “act in accordance with the principleof an open market economy … favouring an efficient allocation of resources”. In other words, weshould only do as much as is necessary to fulfil our price stability mandate. And we should beaware of potential side effects from running expansive policy for too long.An important principle of an open market economy is price formation in markets through theinteraction of private sector agents. It should be those interactions that ensure correct pricing,and not the interactions that take place as a result of our asset purchases. And this also appliesto credit risk.Of course, with the large stock of assets it holds, the Eurosystem has become a big player in the23 4 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
market, bigger than ever before. We sometimes buy bonds from institutional investors, such aspension funds and insurance companies, which could push up the price we need to pay giventhe growing scarcity. We should avoid a situation whereby liquidity conditions in certain marketsegments are unnecessarily made more challenging by an unwarranted extension of thepurchase programme.So we have to be mindful not to exert an undue influence on price formation.Another potential complication relates to our public sector purchases. A key safeguard that wehave set up for these purchases is to operate so-called “blackout periods”, where we do not buyaround the date of a new issuance. This facilitates price formation and ensures that Article 123 ofthe Treaty – the monetary financing prohibition – is fully respected.ConclusionThe economic recovery in the euro area has been better than expected and employment hasrisen strongly. Both wages and underlying inflation appear to have turned the corner.All the conditions are in place for a sustained adjustment in inflation towards our aim. So it’s justa question of time now. More haste, less speed, however.The improving inflation trajectory means that we can gradually scale back our net purchases andkeep monetary policy sufficiently accommodative to continue to support the convergence ofinflation towards our aim.We will continue to monitor developments in the economy and set policy in a way that remainsconsistent with our price stability objective.In doing so, we must also take into account the balance of risks.If we withdraw our monetary policy stimulus too early and too fast, asset prices could collapseand yields rise sharply, with negative spillover effects to the economy.If our asset purchase programme continues for too long, the side effects will increase. And if wenourish a market belief that the exit might be permanently postponed, potential cliff-edge effectscould be exacerbated.We are pursuing a credible prospect for the exit to keep these risks contained.

I would like to congratulate the students who have shown such initiative in creating this event.  My only regret is that the ‘#BeastFromTheEast’ has prevented me from joining you in person, though given my topic, there is something appropriate about joining you virtually. ………………………………………..…   This £20 note is significant.  Figure 1: a £20 banknote   Significant because it honours Adam Smith, the great moral philosopher and hero of the Scottish Enlightenment. Significant because it is a significant amount of money, enough to buy you a burger and a few pints at the Pear Tree pub this evening, or if you fancy a quieter but highly stimulating night in, copies of Smith’s Wealth of Nations and The Theory of Moral Sentiments at Blackwell’s. Significant because without money the decentralised exchange of Smith’s invisible hand could not operate.  Money unlocks the specialism of labour in the pin factory and “the great increase in the quantity of work that results.”2  And only money can solve the coincidence of wants between the butcher, the brewer, the baker and the student on a Friday evening.3                                                       1 ‘Stabilising an unstable economy’ Hyman Minsky, 1986 2 This is the quote as abbreviated on the £20.  The full quote is “this great increase in the quantity of work which, in consequence of the division of labour, the same number of people are capable of performing”, Book 1, Chapter 1, Smith, A., (1776) ‘An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations’. 3 “It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest”. Book 1, Chapter 2, ibid.

Or because you live in Scotland where you’re more likely to encounter Sir Walter Scott or Nan Shepherd on a banknote when you do have cash.4  But because you use electronic forms of money such as debit cards and mobile phones for your everyday purchases and go online for your larger ones. A number of you may hold other forms of electronic money – crypto or virtual currencies such as Bitcoin, Ether or Scotcoin.  And a few may view paper money – even the Bank of England itself – as archaic vestiges of an old centralised order of payments that will soon be swept aside by a digital, distributed future. And that’s my topic today: the future of money. Specifically, how developments in money and payments technologies could transform our economy in ways good and bad.  And how, for the good of the people of the United Kingdom, the Bank of England is helping to manage the potential risks and to realise the promise of the future of money. What is money? In The Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith defines money by the roles it plays in society, in particular, how well it serves as: - A store of value with which to transfer purchasing power from today to some future time; - A medium of exchange with which to make payments for goods and services; and - A unit of account with which to measure the value of a particular good, service, saving or loan. These functions of money operate in a hierarchy (Figure 2).  There are many assets that people view as stores of value — houses, for instance — that are not used as media of exchange. By comparison, an asset can only act as a medium of exchange if at least two people are prepared to treat it as a store of value, at least temporarily.  And for an asset to be considered a unit of account, it must be able to be used as a medium of exchange across a variety of transactions over time between several people.5   The hierarchy points to the reality that money is a social convention.  We accept that a token has value whether made of metal, polymer or code because we expect that others will also do so readily and easily.                                                            4 These characters currently feature on banknotes issued by private banks in Scotland. 5 For this reason, some economists consider the operation as a unit of account to be the most important characteristic of money.  Indeed, it is commonly argued that a defining feature of monetary policy lies in central banks’ control of the unit of account.  See Ali, R., Barrdear, J., Clews, R. and Southgate, J., (2014) ‘The economics of digital currencies’, Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, 2014 Q3. 
   All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 4  4   Figure 2: The three functions of money   The tokens representing money have taken many forms over the millennia from cowry shells in ancient times to cigarettes during the Second World War and mobile phone minutes in modern Kenya. And so it was when the Bank of England was founded in 1694 by a Scot, William Paterson.  Originally its mission (“to promote the good of the people”) was fulfilled by issuing hand-written banknotes, backed by and exchangeable into gold, to help finance King William III’s war with France.   By the late eighteenth century, fears of renewed Anglo-French conflict contributed to runs on the Bank which drained its gold reserves and led to the suspension of convertibility of its notes into gold.  This prompted an MP to describe the Bank as “an elderly lady in the City who had…unfortunately fallen into bad company”.  To this day, the Bank of England is known as the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street. It was not until the 1844 Bank Charter Act that the Bank of England’s note issuance responsibilities were formalised and the rights of others to issue notes in England and Wales began to be phased out.6  Today the Bank is the sole issuer of banknotes in England and Wales, while a number of Scottish and Northern Irish banks can issue notes provided that they are backed by Bank of England notes or funds on deposit at the Bank of England.7 Most forms of money, past and present, have nominal values that far exceed their intrinsic ones.  And this gap has meant that money has a long and sorry history of debasement.  Over the centuries, forms of private money, such as the notes issued by American banks during the free banking of the 19th century, have inevitably succumbed to oversupply and eventual collapse.                                                         6 The last private bank to issue its own banknotes in England and Wales was Fox, Fowler and Company in 1921. 7 Seven banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland can issue banknotes.  The Regulations specify that at least 60% of an authorised bank’s notes in circulation must be backed by Bank of England notes and UK coin and that the remainder, plus all notes with the potential to enter circulation, must be backed either by such notes and coin or by funds placed on deposit in an interest bearing account at the Bank of England.

Throughout history, governments would often betray the trust of their citizens be it Henry VIII reducing the precious metal content of his coins during the Tudor era, Pitt the Younger depleting the gold vaults of the Old Lady during the Regency period, or a pliant Reichsbank financing the government in Weimar Germany.  With the wisdom borne from such sad experience, most countries have now settled on centralised, public fiat money backed by robust institutions in order to provide the public with money that is both highly trusted and easy to use. To understand the breadth of institutions needed for good money, it is important to recognise that modern money takes three forms that are linked by retail and wholesale payments systems.  Each link in the chain is critical to the resilience of money.  The first form of money is the banknotes issued by central banks, such as the Adam Smith £20s.  These account for just 3% of the stock but 40% of all consumer transactions.8  Next is electronic central bank money in the form of the reserves that commercial banks hold with us, including to settle transactions with one another.  Finally, and most significantly, the electronic deposits that commercial banks create when they extend loans to borrowers, accounting for fully 80% of money in the system.9   The private financial sector cannot create money without limit, but is disciplined by competition, constrained by prudential regulation, and limited by decisions of households and companies that can reduce the stock of money (by, for example, repaying existing debt).   Monetary policy is the ultimate limit on money creation because it directly influences the price of money and other financial assets and therefore the demand for the money created by the private sector.10   Most of the institutions that underpin sterling’s effectiveness as money are now housed in the Bank of England.11  In particular: - Our commitment to the highest quality banknotes that you and the publican can use with confidence.  That paper £20 note contains sophisticated counterfeit protections ranging from holographic images to ultraviolet features, which will be further enhanced when we switch to a polymer £20 in 2020;12 - The foundation of the payments system, RTGS, which processes over £600 billion of bank-to-bank payments per day to the highest standards of efficiency and resilience;13                                                       8 The data are for 2016.  To note, banknotes accounted for 45% of transactions in 2015, and as such there was a 5 percentage point fall year-on-year which may be related to increased use of cards and online payments. 9 See McLeay, M., Radia, A., and Thomas, R., (2014), Money Creation in the Modern Economy, Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin 2014 Q1, which notes that the reality of how money is created often differs from that found in standard textbooks, and rather than banks receiving deposits when households save and then lending them out, bank lending creates deposits. 10 Although it does not target monetary aggregates per se, the Bank of England conducts monetary policy to ensure the amount of money creation in the economy is consistent with low and stable inflation. In normal times, the Bank of England implements monetary policy by setting the interest rate on central bank reserves.  In exceptional times when interest rates cannot be lowered further, the Bank implements monetary policy by purchasing assets, which has the by-product of increasing the central bank reserve holdings of private banks. 11 Other institutions include legal tender status (meaning that you cannot be sued for non-payment of debts if you offer sterling to meet them) and the insurance of deposits of up to £85,000 at banks and building societies backed by the Government. 12 This will feature JMW Turner.

The Bank has been given clear remits by Parliament for these responsibilities and has operational independence to use its powers to achieve them.  We are accountable to Parliament and the people for our performance. The combination of this robust institutional framework and the fact that only sterling is legal tender in the UK sets a very high bar for competing forms of money to dislodge sterling. But at present, more than a thousand virtual or “crypto” currencies are trying to do just that.   The Advent of Cryptocurrencies In the depths of the global financial crisis, the coincidence of technological developments and collapsing confidence in some banking systems sparked the cryptocurrency revolution.   Its advocates claim that a decentralised cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, is more trustworthy than centralised fiat money because: - Its supply is fixed and therefore immune from the age-old temptations of debasement;  - Its use is free from risky private banks; and   - Those who hold it can remain anonymous and therefore free from the ravenous eyes of tax authorities or worse still law enforcement.  Some also argue that cryptocurrencies could be more efficient than centralised fiat money because the underlying distributed ledger technology cuts out intermediaries like central banks and financial institutions and allows payments to be made directly between payer and payee.14,15                                                                                                                                                                                   13 The Bank operates the Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) service and infrastructure that holds accounts for banks, building societies and other institutions.  The balances in these accounts can be used to move money in real time between these account holders.  This delivers final and risk-free settlement. 14 Whereas banks hold records of most fiat money and are entrusted to ensure its validity, with digital currencies, the ledger containing all transactions by all users is publicly available.  Rather than placing trust in central institutions – such as banks (and by extension the

The answer has to be judged against the functioning of the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem (which extends beyond the currencies themselves to the exchanges on which cryptocurrencies can be bought and sold, the miners who create new coins and verify transactions and update the ledger, and the wallet providers who offer custodian services). The long, charitable answer is that cryptocurrencies act as money, at best, only for some people and to a limited extent, and even then only in parallel with the traditional currencies of the users.  The short answer is they are failing. Poor Stores of Value Cryptocurrencies are proving poor short-term stores of value.  Over the past five years, the daily standard deviation of Bitcoin was ten times that of sterling.  Consider that if you had taken out a £1,000 student loan in Bitcoin in last December to pay your sterling living costs for next year, you’d be short about £500 right now.  If you’d done the same last September, you’d be ahead by £2,000.  That’s quite a lottery.   And Bitcoin is one of the more stable cryptocurrencies.  Indeed, the average volatility of the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalisation was more than 25 times that of the US equities market in 2017. This extreme volatility reflects in part that cryptocurrencies have neither intrinsic value nor any external backing.  Their worth rests on beliefs regarding their future supply and demand—ultimately whether they will be successful as money.   Thus far, however, rather than such a sober assessment of future prospects, the prices of many cryptocurrencies have exhibited the classic hallmarks of bubbles including new paradigm justifications, broadening retail enthusiasm and extrapolative price expectations reliant in part on finding the greater fool. Far from being strengths, the fixed supply rules of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are serious deficiencies.  Fundamentally, they would impart a deflationary bias on the economy if such currencies were to be widely adopted.16  If “those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it”17, recreating a virtual global gold standard would be a criminal act of monetary amnesia.                                                                                                                                                                                  centralised authorities like the Bank of England that supervise them) – reliance is placed on the network and the rules to update the ledger reliably. 15 Satoshi Nakamoto (2008), ‘Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System’ bitcoin.org, October 2008. 16 For example, the supply of Bitcoin is limited to 21 million units by 2040.  In the long run, a fixed money supply may harm the macroeconomy by contributing to deflation in the prices of goods and services, and in wages.  And the inability of the money supply to vary in response to demand would likely cause greater volatility in prices and real activity.   17 As the Italian philosopher George Santayana famously observed.

As my colleague Agustin Carstens has argued, this surge of competitors and the “forking” of Bitcoin echoes the debasement of private monies in the past.18  Inefficient Media of Exchange The most fundamental reason to be sceptical about the longer term value of cryptocurrencies is that it is not clear the extent to which they will ever become effective media of exchange. Currently, no major high street or online retailer accepts Bitcoin as payment in the UK, and only a handful of the top 500 US online retailers do.   For those who can find someone willing to accept payment for goods and services in cryptocurrencies, the speed and cost of the transaction varies but it is generally slower and more expensive than payments in sterling.   That’s because the more heavily used cryptocurrencies face severe capacity constraints compared with other payment systems.  For example, Visa can process up to 65,000 transactions per second globally against just 7 per second for Bitcoin. And if you use a debit or credit card in the UK, the transaction is completed in seconds and without exchange rate risk.  In contrast, Bitcoin users can face queues of hours.  Those wanting to get to the front to make time-pressing payments – for last orders, for example – need to offer up a transaction fee sufficiently large to persuade Bitcoin “miners”, who verify and process transactions, to do so quickly.  The fees paid vary through time, but reached £40 in late 2017.  Fees are currently around £2, but even that is expensive relative to cash, cards or online payments which cost the retailer around 1.5 pence, 8 pence and 19 pence respectively.19   Over time, Bitcoin transaction fees could rise further because the subsidy miners enjoy by being partly paid with rewards of new units of currency, will decline given the total supply of Bitcoin cannot exceed 21 million.20   Furthermore, the costs of Bitcoin mining are enormous.  Its current annual electricity consumption is estimated by some to be up to 52 terawatt hours, double the electricity consumption of Scotland.21  In comparison, the global Visa credit card network’s energy use is less than ½ of 1% of that of Bitcoin, despite processing 9000 times more transactions.22                                                       18 Carstens, A., (2018), “Money in the Digital Age: What Role Central Banks?”  See https://www.bis.org/speeches/sp180206.htm  19 Based on the British Retail Consortium’s Payment Survey 2016, which surveys the costs that retailers incur for accepting payments, including bank charges, handling charges, infrastructure costs and write-offs (losses). Link to survey: https://brc.org.uk/media/179489/payment-survey-2016_final.pdf 20 The reward for each new block halves every 210,000 blocks (approximately every 4 years) and currently stands at 12.5 bitcoin per block.  This regular halving of the block reward results in an exponential slow-down in the growth rate of Bitcoin supply. It is estimated that by 2040 99.8% of total maximum Bitcoin supply will have been generated.  21 For Bitcoin energy usage, see: https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption.

Retailers that quote in Bitcoin usually update at very high frequency so as to maintain stable prices in traditional currencies such as US dollars or sterling.  The Bank is not aware of any business that accepts Bitcoins in payments that also maintains its accounts in Bitcoin. The Policy Response  Even though their prospects of replacing fiat money are tenuous at best, cryptocurrencies are of growing interest to policymakers, many of whom prefer to term them crypto-assets expressly because they are not true currencies—a convention I will adopt for the balance of my remarks. On the upside, as I will come onto in a moment, some of the underlying technologies are exciting. Whatever the merits of cryptocurrencies as money, authorities should be careful not to stifle innovations which could in the future improve financial stability; support more innovative, efficient and reliable payment services as well as have wider applications.23 On the downside, at present, crypto-assets raise a host of issues around consumer and investor protection, market integrity, money laundering, terrorism financing, tax evasion, and the circumvention of capital controls and international sanctions.   The Bank of England’s FPC is currently considering the risks posed to UK financial stability.  And internationally the Financial Stability Board (FSB) will report to the G20 in Argentina later this month on the financial stability implications of crypto-assets.   At present, in my view, crypto-assets do not appear to pose material risks to financial stability.   This is in part because they are small relative to the financial system.  Even at their recent peak, their combined global market capitalisation was less than 1% of global GDP.  In comparison, at the height of the dotcom mania, the valuations of technology stocks were closer to about a third of global GDP.  And just prior to the global financial crisis, the notional value of credit derivative swaps was 100%.  In addition, major UK financial institutions have minimal exposures to the crypto-asset ecosystem.   Looking ahead, financial stability risks could rise if retail participation significantly increased or linkages with the formal financial sector grew without material improvements in market integrity, anti-money laundering standards and cyber defences.                                                         23 Innovations are reducing computational efforts to prove a transaction, such as Litecoin and Ethereum’s proposed moves to “proof of stake” from “proof of work”.   
   All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 10  10   Authorities are rightly concerned that given their inefficiency and anonymity, one of the main reasons for their use is to shield illicit activities.24  This cannot be condoned.  Anarchy may reign on the dark web, but in the UK it’s just a song that your parents used to listen to. Moreover, structural vulnerabilities in cryptocurrencies mean that they are inherently risky compared with traditional financial assets.  The risks include extreme price volatility and poor market liquidity due to fragmented markets and highly concentrated holdings, which in turn facilitate manipulation and misconduct.  These vulnerabilities are compounded by operational and technological weaknesses, as evidenced by a series of major crypto-asset heists.25 In addition, there is unease that the combination of these vulnerabilities and widening retail participation could damage the reputations of those financial intermediaries connected to crypto-asset markets.  In extreme circumstances, it could even undermine confidence in the broader financial system itself, particularly if people held an unfounded belief that authorities had legitimised these activities. To isolate, regulate or integrate? Authorities need to decide whether to isolate, regulate or integrate crypto-assets and their associated activities. A few jurisdictions have banned crypto-assets outright.26  And some regulators have sealed off crypto-assets from the core of the financial system in order to curtail risk of contagion.  Most prominently, China—which had been one of the most active crypto-asset markets—recently banned exchanges, financial institutions and payment processors from handling them. If widely adopted, however, isolation risks foregoing potentially major opportunities from the development of the underlying payments technologies.   A better path would be to regulate elements of the crypto-asset ecosystem to combat illicit activities, promote market integrity, and protect the safety and soundness of the financial system.   The time has come to hold the crypto-asset ecosystem to the same standards as the rest of the financial system.  Being part of the financial system brings enormous privileges, but with them great responsibilities.                                                       24 The proportion of crypto-assets used for illicit activity remains hard to quantify.  One academic study suggests that about a quarter of Bitcoin users and one-half of all Bitcoin transactions are associated with illegal activity.  Sean Foley, Jonathan R. Karlsen, and Tālis J. Putniņš (2018), ‘Sex, Drugs, and Bitcoin: How Much Illegal Activity Is Financed Through Cryptocurrencies?’ available at http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3102645. 25 In February 2014, MtGox, the largest Bitcoin exchange at the time, revealed that around 850,000 of customers’ Bitcoins, then valued at around $450 million, were missing and had likely been stolen. In 2016, 120,000 units of Bitcoin valued at $72 million were stolen from Bitfinex’s customer accounts.  In January 2018, $530 million of cryptocurrency “XEM” was stolen from Japanese exchange CoinCheck.  In all cases, funds were stolen from “hot wallets”, where the private key is stored on a computer or device that is connected, directly or indirectly, to the internet. 26 Cryptocurrencies have been banned in Bangladesh, Bolivia, Ecuador and Morocco. 
   All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 11  11   In this spirit, the EU and the US are requiring crypto exchanges to meet the same anti-money laundering and counter the financing of terrorism standards as other financial institutions.27 Conduct and market regulators are considering how to classify crypto-assets, in order to secure market integrity and determine the appropriate type and level of investor protections.  In my view, holding crypto-asset exchanges to the same rigorous standards as those that trade securities would address a major underlap in the regulatory approach. And as the SEC and FCA have argued forcefully, so-called initial coin offerings will not be allowed to use semantics to avoid securities laws designed to protect retail investors in particular.  Prudential regulators, like the Bank’s PRC, are in the process of clarifying how the existing regulatory requirements – including for capital – which institutions at the core of the financial system must meet, apply to any future crypto-asset activity undertaken and exposures acquired.   Recently in the US, the regulated exchanges CME and CBOE have started to offer Bitcoin futures.  Having derivatives traded and cleared on exchanges could, in time, raise standards in them and mean that regulators have better information about how the underlying markets function. The discussions at the FSB and the G20 will be valuable given the diversity of possible approaches and the decentralised and cross-border nature of crypto-assets.   Pointing to the Future I trust you have gathered by now that for many reasons the crypto-assets in your digital wallets are unlikely to be the future of money.   But that is not meant to dismiss them.  Their core technology is already having an impact.  Bringing crypto-assets into the regulatory tent could potentially catalyse innovations to serve the public better.  Indeed, crypto-assets help point the way to the future of money in three respects:  - By suggesting how money and payments will need to adjust to meet societies’ changing preferences, particularly for decentralised peer-to-peer interactions;  - Through the possibilities their underlying technologies offer to transform the efficiency, reliability and flexibility of payments; and - By the questions they raise about whether central banks should provide a central bank digital currency (CBDC) accessible to all.                                                       27 In the EU, the revision of the 4th AML Directive will bring exchanges and wallet providers in the scope of the anti-money laundering and combatting the financing of terrorism rules.  In the US, virtual currency exchanges are regulated as money transmitters and required to abide by Bank Secrecy Act obligations. 
   All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 12  12   Let me take these in turn. First, crypto-assets are part of a broader reorganisation of the economy and society into a series of distributed peer-to-peer connections across powerful networks.28  People are increasingly forming connections directly, instantaneously and openly, and this is revolutionising how they consume, work, and communicate.   Yet the financial system continues to be arranged around a series of hubs and spokes like banks and payments, clearing and settlement systems.  Crypto-assets are an attempt to create the financial architecture for peer-to-peer transactions.  Even if the current generation is not the answer, it is throwing down the gauntlet to the existing payment systems.  These must now evolve to meet the demands of fully reliable, real-time, distributed transactions. Second, the technologies underlying crypto-assets, particularly distributed ledger, can: - Increase the efficiency of managing data;  - Improve resilience by eliminating central points of failure, as multiple parties will share replicated data and functionality;  - Enhance transparency (and auditability) through the creation of instant, permanent and immutable records of transactions; and  - Expand the use of straight-through processes, including with “smart contracts” that on receipt of new information, automatically update and if appropriate, pay. These properties mean distributed ledger technology could transform everything from how people manage of their interactions with public agencies, including their tax and medical records, through to how businesses manage their supply chains. Third, crypto-assets raise the obvious question about whether their infrastructure could be combined with the trust inherent in existing fiat currencies to create a central bank digital currency (CBDC).   Currently only banks can hold central bank money electronically in the form of a settlement account at the Bank of England.  To be truly transformative a general purpose CBDC would open access to individuals and firms. The Bank has an open mind about the eventual development of a CBDC and an active research programme dedicated to it.  That said, given current technological shortcomings in distributed ledger technologies and the risks with offering central bank accounts for all, a true, widely available reliable CBDC does not appear to be a near-term prospect.                                                         28 See Fergusson, N., (2017), ‘The Square and the Tower: Networks, Hierarchies and the Struggle for Global Power’. 
   All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 13  13   Moreover whether it is desirable depends on the answers to a series of big policy questions.  While these are largely for another speech, I will note that a general purpose CBDC could mean a much greater role for central banks in the financial system.  Central banks may find themselves disintermediating commercial banks in normal times and running the risk of destabilising flights to quality in times of stress.29 There are also broader societal questions (that others would need to answer) such as how society balances privacy rights with the extent to which the information in a CBDC could be used to fight terrorism and economic crime. A CBDC shouldn’t be a solution in search of a problem or an effort of central bankers to be down with the kids.    Especially because there are more immediate ways to give you what you want. The Foundation of Better Payments So while our research on a possible future CBDC will continue, we’re more excited by the opportunities to transform digital payments now. In particular, the combination of the Bank’s overhaul of RTGS and new technologies promises a world where payment systems can better meet societal demands for fully reliable, real-time, distributed peer-to-peer transactions.  RTGS is already pretty awesome, settling over £600bn of payments in real time each day, while eliminating settlement risk and with an extremely high degree of resilience, all at a cost – to direct participants – of less than one ten millionth of the value of the average payment.  But RTGS is also the same age as most of you and so we are renewing it.30 What could this rather technical sounding development mean for you?  More than you might think.                                                       29 See Broadbent, B., (2016), “Central Banks and Digital Currencies”, a speech given at the LSE https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2016/central-banks-and-digital-currencies 30 See “A Blueprint for a new RTGS service for the United Kingdom”, May 2017. 
   All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 14  14   Currently when you pay for your burger and beer in the pub, or your books in Blackwell’s, you probably use a debit card, a credit card or digital wallet on your phone.  These need to be routed through the card provider’s network.  Over the past four years, the payment-related costs that your publican or bookseller pay (and ultimately pass on to you) have come down by 40% to around 8 pence per transaction.  While these are small – and much better than Bitcoin – they remain non-negligible.  That’s partly because there is limited scope for them to be competed away by innovators offering lower costs, faster speeds and more convenience, due to rigidities in the existing payments landscape, including restricted access to the UK’s major bank-to-bank payment system, Faster Payments (FPS).  To put a number on it, indirect members of FPS face relatively high fees of around 37 pence per transaction.31 In 2016, the Bank announced arrangements under which non-bank payment service providers (PSPs) could access RTGS, and therefore FPS directly, and we expect the first will join this spring.   PSPs that make the most of this development and reach critical mass could see their per transaction costs fall below those of debit and credit card providers.  And the competition provided by the PSPs should incentivise existing providers to innovate as well. Moreover, innovative PSPs could deliver a world where you can split a round in the pub electronically and instantaneously, needing nothing more from your friends than a QR code on their phone or their phone number.  By so doing, electronic money will become more like its physical relative, allowing genuine, immediate peer-to-peer transactions, without the need for a middleman. Our overhaul of RTGS is helping to reduce complexity and costs in other areas as well. Take cross-border payments, where the Bank is leading by the adoption of emerging global standards for payments messaging and by working with other central banks and the private sector to explore the scope for cross-border payments in central bank money through synchronised national RTGS systems.  This all could increase the speed and safety, as well as lower the costs, associated with cross-border transactions to support purchases and travel overseas. When coupled with the capture of richer payments data made possible by its renewal, RTGS will help support innovative services for the more effective management of personal and company finances.  These benefits will be amplified by the UK’s ambition in implementing the Open Banking standard– under which the largest banks will be required to make customer data available to other existing firms and innovators, if the customer demands.  In turn, this will help improve aggregator, comparison and switching services.   Taken together, these advances will support innovation that allows you to manage your finances seamlessly, from tracking how much you spend on beer and books, to managing your future savings and current loans.                                                       31 PSR indirect access market review, https://www.psr.org.uk/sites/default/files/media/PDF/MR1512-indirect-access-market-review-interim-report.pdf 
   All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 15  15   Finally, at the wholesale payments end, we’ve already explored whether the core of the new RTGS system could run on distributed ledger to discover that the technology is not yet sufficiently mature or reliable to run a system that settles the equivalent of a third of the UK’s annual GDP each day and requires 5-sigma performance.   Nonetheless, the Bank believes that distributed ledger technology could over time significantly improve the accuracy, efficiency and security of processes across payments, clearing and settlement.  Securities settlement in particular is ripe for innovation.  Transactions that take nanoseconds to execute, currently take days to settle along a chain involving many intermediaries.  At stake, are the tens of billions of pounds of capital that are tied up while settlement completes.32  The best in the private sector are working hard unlocking this value.  That’s why the Bank is building the new RTGS so that new forms of securities settlement that meet our standards of resilience (including those using distributed ledger) will be able to plug in directly.   Ultimately this combination of new technology and direct access to RTGS could be applied to other assets such as helping make the payment, registration and Stamp Duty processes involved in house purchases quicker and more efficient. The Future of Money While Adam Smith was cautious about the role of the state, he recognised it should furnish the rules and conditions within which private innovation can flourish.   In the monetary sphere, this means providing money which citizens can use with confidence and ease.   The Bank of England delivers just that through the quality of our banknotes, the stability of UK inflation, the resilience of our financial system, and efficiency and reliability of our core payment systems.  We are overhauling our system, RTGS, so that private innovation can flourish.  Bringing crypto-assets onto a level regulatory playing field could also catalyse private innovation to create a more resilient, effective payments system. With these foundations in place, the scene is set for better payments, a better economy and a better Friday night out.                                                       32 Oliver Wyman and Santander estimated that distributed ledger technology could reduce banks’ infrastructure costs attributable to cross-border payments, securities trading and regulatory compliance by $15-20bn per annum by 2022.

SPEECH  Page 1 of 9 BY GOVERNOR LARS ROHDE  AT THE NATIONAL ASSET-LIABILITY MANAGEMENT EUROPE      CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY   INTEREST RATES – LOW FOR LONG  Thank you very much for the opportunity to speak here today. It is my great pleasure to be able to share with you some of Denmark's experi-ences with low interest rates, as well as my views on future issues in monetary policy.      Exceptionally easy monetary policy has played a fundamental role in supporting the economic recovery over the past decade. Now, a con-tinued and more robust global upswing is expected to be accompanied by normalisation of interest rates. This development is welcome and has been a long time coming. But the withdrawal from monetary stimulus will also reveal whether vulnerabilities have accumulated in some parts of the financial sector. Further, it will show just how robust our economies are to higher financing costs.  In the following, I will focus on three key messages: First, I will talk about global growth. My main point here is that while the long-awaited global upturn is gaining strength, growth is not likely to  attain pre-crisis levels.  Second, I will discuss the effects of low rates and unconventional mon-etary policy. Central bank balance sheets have expanded substantially. In Denmark, banks' earnings have been under pressure, although the im-pact on overall profitability has been limited. And finally, the pace and timing of policy normalisation will require care-ful calibration. International spillovers from major central banks are inev-     1 March 2018 
  Page 2 of 9 itable, especially for small open economies. The final implementation of regulatory reforms and an effective macroprudential policy framework will be essential to containing financial stability risks.  1. Long-awaited global upturn gains strength, but pre-crisis growth rates are likely unattainable Slide 2: Global economy is strengthening After a long period of disappointing outturns, global growth is strength-ening. Forecasts are now being revised up. Stronger and more broad-based global growth and increasing trade are being supported by pri-vate consumption and higher investments. Indicators of consumer and manufacturing sentiment point towards a continued cyclical upswing in the coming years.  Although it may be tempting, policymakers cannot spend time compla-cently enjoying the long-awaited recovery. One reason is that the cyclical upswing is exactly that … cyclical. Continued higher growth in the me-dium-term is not a given and potential growth is still deemed lower than pre-crisis levels in many countries. The mantra from international institu-tions has changed accordingly. Previously, we were reminded not to waste a good crisis. Now, we should not waste a good recovery. Imple-mentation of structural reforms and rebuilding of fiscal buffers are crucial for sustaining growth and preparing for the next downturn. This is espe-cially true, given that monetary policy has been pushed to its limit. Thus, monetary policy cannot be relied upon to provide much further stimulus, should the cycle turn sooner than expected. As regards structural reforms, progress has been mixed. In Denmark, we are currently reaping the benefits of past reforms to increase the struc-tural supply of labor. This is contributing to a more balanced upswing, compared to the boom and associated overheating in the mid-2000s. So, while structural initiatives are unlikely to affect cyclical outcomes in the short-term, I certainly agree that they are important for a sustained re-covery.  Slide 3: Lower growth rates to be expected going forward But we also have to consider whether we can realistically expect growth rates in advanced countries at pre-crisis levels again. This is unlikely, due to demographic change, among other things. A recent study by Dan-marks Nationalbank points to a reduction in GDP per capita by about 0.3 percentage points until 2050, due to the ageing population. Obviously, this should not be an excuse. Continued steps to increase productivity 
  Page 3 of 9 and enhance flexibility in labor markets are important. However, it would seem prudent to set our expectations for future growth realistically, and adjust fiscal forecasts accordingly.  2. Low rates and unconventional monetary policies have supported the economy Slide 4: Danish monetary-policy rates are closely linked to ECB rates It has now been ten years since the global financial crisis disrupted the global economy. Looking back today, it has been a very exciting decade – too exciting perhaps – from a central banking perspective.   High public debt levels restrained the fiscal capacity in a number of coun-tries following the financial and economic meltdown. Thus, central banks were more or less left on their own to support economic activity. Conse-quently, very low and even negative policy rates have become common globally, alongside massive expansions of some central bank balance sheets.  Danmarks Nationalbank was a central bank pioneer when we first cut our deposit rate below zero already in 2012. This was done to offset large capital inflows. As you might already know, the fixed exchange rate policy in Denmark means that our monetary policy rates are exclusively re-served for maintaining the peg against the euro. Therefore, the key mon-etary policy rate of Danmarks Nationalbank tends to track that of the ECB very closely.  In Denmark, we have had negative rates for some years now. So far, their implications have been far less exciting or radical than some might have expected before entering negative territory. Basically, negative interest rates have just been a continuation of low rates, with strong pass-through to money market rates. However, the financial sector has had to adapt to the new environment.  Negative interest rates have put pressure on banks' earnings  Slide 5: Households are exempt from negative deposit rates First of all, negative rates have challenged Danish banks' business  models. Net interest margins and thereby net interest income have been squeezed. The introduction of negative policy rates has meant that a sig-nificant share of bank deposits with Danmarks Nationalbank is currently being remunerated at a rate of -0.65 per cent. While lending rates have mirrored the fall in monetary policy rates, banks have been reluctant to 
  Page 4 of 9 introduce negative deposit rates on household deposits. This likely re-flects concerns about reputational risks. In contrast, negative rates have been more widely introduced on corporate deposits.  The spread between short term and long term interest rates is also im-portant for banks’ maturity transformation business. The ECB’s large scale asset purchases have worked to reduce the spread between long term and short term interest rates. This has made such efforts less profit-able for banks. These declining margins have lowered banks' net interest income signifi-cantly. The largest banks have so far been able to compensate by ex-panding into new business areas, such as wealth management, and by adjusting their fees. Smaller banks typically rely more heavily on deposit funding. For them, the adjustment has been much more difficult. On the positive side, negative interest rates have contributed to a fa-vourable macroeconomic climate driving loan impairment charges to a minimum. The effect from very low impairment charges is one of the main explanations for the record-high results booked by the largest Danish banks in recent years. These results have been achieved despite the pres-sure from falling interest margins.  Increased resilience of banks should lower the expected return on equity  Slide 6: More resilience and low interest rate: Required return on bank equity can be lowered With the strengthening of profits in recent years, Danish banks have clearly put the financial crisis behind them. Equally important, we now have a financial sector that is much more robust than prior to the crisis. The financial crisis revealed that many financial institutions were insuffi-ciently capitalised. As a result, some of them were not resilient to the losses incurred in the wake of the crisis and the subsequent market cor-rection. This inability to absorb losses exacerbated the economic down-turn. Since then, much has been done to increase the resilience of the fi-nancial system, both internationally and in Denmark. For example, capital requirements have been enhanced, and the solvency of Danish financial institutions has improved considerably. This has contributed to a more robust financial system as a whole.  Expected returns are likely to be lower than pre-crisis levels as an effect of higher capitalisation and increased resilience of banks. Especially in a low interest rate environment, the perception that returns on equity should be double-digit is misguided. And setting targeted returns at such 
  Page 5 of 9 high levels may trigger banks to take on far too much risk and create new vulnerabilities for the future. It may take some time for investors to adjust their expectations. They will need to take into account that the risks em-bedded in banks' shares have declined with increased capitalisation and that banks have become a safer investment.   Central bank balance sheets have expanded markedly Slide 7: Expanding central bank balance sheets With interest rates closer to their effective lower bound than ever before, central banks have had to resort to new approaches to achieve the ne-cessary monetary accommodation. These approaches include unconven-tional measures such as targeted lending operations, asset purchases and forward guidance.  Consequently, several central banks in advanced economies have experi-enced pronounced balance sheet expansions. This is clear evidence that monetary policy has played a key role during the last decade of crisis management in the global economy.  Usually, variations in the balance sheet of Danmarks Nationalbank reflect changes in our foreign-exchange reserves. And as you probably know, Denmark experienced a massive inflow of currency shortly after the Swiss central bank's decision to abandon the floor on the Swiss franc against the euro. Over the following weeks, we saw unusual turbulence in the Danish foreign-exchange market. So in response, we used our usual measures to defend the peg. We intervened heavily in the FX market by buying euros and selling Danish kroner to meet the elevated demand. In addition, monetary policy rates were significantly reduced. The sizeable intervention caused a sharp increase in FX reserves by almost 15 per cent of GDP in less than two months. As the pressure abated, the level of FX reserves was gradually reversed over the course of 2015 to reach a level of just above 20 per cent of GDP – close to the current level.  We do not have a specific target for the foreign exchange reserves, but it should remain sufficient to support the peg. For example, due to financial turmoil in 2008, Danmarks Nationalbank decided to increase the size of its foreign-exchange reserves in order to signal its commitment to the fixed-exchange-rate policy. Rising asset valuations in light of easy financial conditions  Let me now move on to the effects of exceptionally supportive monetary policy on financial markets. In the current environment of easy financial conditions, asset valuations and leverage have risen. Asset price in-

Slide 8: Rising house prices in European cities In Denmark, we are especially focused on risks associated with house price developments. A number of European countries experienced hous-ing bubbles in the years prior to the financial crisis, including Denmark. In the post-crisis period of low rates, real estate prices have again increased rapidly in many countries – from China to Canada to Australia and the Nordics.  In most countries, real house prices in and around larger cities have risen most. To some extent, this reflects various structural factors, such as ur-banisation, rising incomes, and supply constraints in some cities. But this could also be an indication of financial recklessness. In Denmark, we are thus paying close attention to house prices in Copenhagen. These prices are beginning to bear some resemblance to levels reached during the bubble in the mid-2000s. However, when taking account of fundamental factors, such as mortgage rates, income levels, and the housing stock, there is no clear sign of a speculative bubble – at least not yet.  In general, house prices should be assessed relative to income levels. This chart shows house prices in several large European cities, relative to GDP per capita. Here, Copenhagen is not currently an outlier. Elevated price levels are a wide-spread issue in European cities, and we have re-cently seen corrections in Stockholm and Oslo. Price developments should be carefully monitored and appropriately addressed pre-emptively through, for example, macroprudential measures. In Denmark, we have taken steps, requiring higher financial robustness for buyers in major cities. For sure, housing affordability is also a major social issue to be tackled, but this is largely beyond the remit of central bankers.   3. Normalisation of monetary policy entails risks Timing of normalisation requires careful calibration Now, I would like to turn the perspective towards the future. It is evident that we still have a whole range of challenges we need to address.    Going forward, a key stability challenge for central banks will be to man-age a balanced exit strategy from easy monetary policy. As output gaps close and unemployment decreases in both the US and the euro area, normalisation is expected to proceed gradually. Synchronisation with 
  Page 7 of 9 economic developments will be critical. Missteps are likely to be followed by abrupt asset price adjustments and financial market disruption. Op-positely, if the normalisation phase is excessively prolonged, build-up of vulnerabilities in the financial system may be exacerbated. Either way, normalisation entails risks. Steady and well-communicated policy tighten-ing will be important to manage market expectations.  In this regard, it will be important to follow developments in government bond markets. The recent correction in equity markets was accompanied by a surge in implied volatility. The increase in implied volatility on long-term German government bonds over the same period was modest, and it remains well below its average level over the past ten years. Finally, normalisation of monetary policy could be complicated by con-tinued subdued inflation. Recent higher inflation in the euro area seems to be mainly driven by energy prices, while core inflation remains low. The possible flattening of the Phillips curve has received a lot of attention lately. In Denmark, nominal wage growth has remained modest, despite capacity pressures and increasing labour shortages in some sectors. However, real wage growth has been above the historical average since the beginning of 2015.  International spillovers from major central banks are inevitable, especially for small open economies   As the Federal Reserve and the ECB initiate balance sheet normalisation and rate hikes, the effects will be transmitted to other economies be-cause of the high integration of global financial markets. This is not news to you. Both stability and turbulence in financial markets are increasingly synchronised across regions and continents. This is so, even as monetary policy cycles and economic recoveries differ in timing. International spill-overs of balance sheet normalisation are thus inevitable and not to be underestimated, if past experience is any guide.  Obviously, the Danish exchange-rate peg can only be maintained be-cause we are willing to implement the same monetary policy stance as the euro area. This is a precondition in a world with international capital mobility. A strong spillover from the ECB's monetary policy to Danish fi-nancial conditions is therefore to be expected.  A recent study1 from Danmarks Nationalbank shows how the ECB's asset- purchase programme had a clear spillover effect on Danish bond mar-                                                   1  See Jakob Roager Jensen, Jakob Guldbæk Mikkelsen and Morten Spange, The ECB's unconventional monetary policy and the role of exchange rate regimes in cross-country spillovers, Danmarks Nationalbank Working Paper, no. 119,  August 2017.  
  Page 8 of 9 kets. Since the beginning of the ECB's QE-programme, the reaction of Danish sovereign bonds has been very much in line with German bonds. This is the case even though no official bond purchases took place in Denmark. Therefore, we should also be prepared for the opposite effect when the ECB starts to roll back its unconventional measures.   In general, small open economies are highly influenced by global mon-etary policy factors. And it has been confirmed by leading researchers that this applies for countries with fixed as well as floating exchange rates. Therefore, you might say that small open economies to a large de-gree import the financial conditions set by larger economies.  Spillovers are best mitigated through robust economic policies. Here, it is important for countries to live up to the so-called OHIO principle, keep-ing their own houses in order. Furthermore, continued international co-operation will be crucial. I would like to conclude my intervention here today with some more detailed comments regarding a specific area where cross-border harmonisation is vital, namely financial regulation. New regulatory framework is essential for financial stability  Slide 9: A new foundation of financial regulation Solid capital adequacy is an important component of the new post-crisis regulatory framework. This framework is still in the implementation phase, internationally and in Denmark. In my view, the regulatory frame-work, which in the EU is based on the single rulebook, rests on three pil-lars. These pillars address capital, liquidity and resolution. As already emphasised, this means first, ensuring a solid, true and fair capital ad-equacy position based on the actual risk exposure of banks. Second, we need requirements to ensure healthy liquidity management and stable financing, as included in recent Basel reforms. Last but not least, we need a credible resolution regime. In the European case, we need strict imple-mentation of the EU directive on Banking Recovery and Resolution. This includes setting minimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabil-ities to be used in the resolution of a bank in troubles. It also includes formulating credible resolution plans for credit institutions. This is all about getting the incentives right. No credit institution should be “too big to fail”.  These are well-known areas of progress since the crisis, but we still have some way to go before the new and harmonised regulatory framework is fully in place. There are indeed still bumps on the road. At the current juncture, where the memory of the last financial crisis seems to be fading, 
  Page 9 of 9 it is important that we stay committed to the implementation of the new regulation. This will reduce the likelihood of a new financial crisis with all its detrimental effects on our economy. If we – through ongoing reforms and implementation of the new rules being adopted in Basel and Brussels – end up delivering on all three pil-lars of regulation, then I think we have learned our lesson from the crisis well. And once all these measures are in place, we will be ready to take the next step: removing unnecessary red tape by simplifying the remain-ing part of the regulation and easing some of the administrative burden on banks. The three-pillar system would leave it to market forces to keep the finan-cial sector in check. As long as banks perform on all three parameters, the credibility and soundness of their balance sheets and business  models will ensure their access to necessary capital and funding. And with the resolution regime in place, we no longer need governments to save banks with taxpayers’ money.  Conclusion To conclude, this period of low interest rates and unconventional mon-etary policy has been fundamental for the economic recovery. While global economic developments are indeed strengthening, we should be prepared for lower growth rates going forward. Structural reforms to lift potential growth and rebuilding of fiscal buffers are important. Low interest rates have also left a legacy, affecting banks' earnings, cen-tral bank balance sheets, as well as asset-price valuations. As normalisa-tion of monetary policy proceeds, we must be ready to carefully manage risks and spillovers. Implementation of regulatory reforms and an effect-ive macroprudential framework will be essential to contain financial sta-bility risks. Thank you very much for your attention.

Andreas Dombret: Living with fragmentation – post-Brexit realitiesin financial servicesKeynote speech by Dr Andreas Dombret, Member of the Executive Board of the DeutscheBundesbank, at the AIMA Global Policy and Regulatory Forum, Dublin, 20 March 2018.*   *   *1 IntroductionLadies and gentlemenThank you for the kind introduction. It is a pleasure to be in Dublin and at the 2018 AIMA Forum."Managing a fragmented world” is, in my view, a well-chosen topic. Most economic policymakerscurrently have their hands full trying to escape the doom loop of a trade war and a potentially hardBrexit. At the same time, banks, investors and most other firms have to prepare for these worst-case scenarios – not least, because supervisors urge them to.And of course such fragmentation in financial services and its regulation may cause nightmaresfor many in the industry as well as for policymakers. And I do understand that – because itimplies a great deal of uncertainty.But we should not, I believe, panic: greater fragmentation seems inevitable after Brexit. Though,repercussions will not be as bad, as some fear, when we succeed in managing this greaterfragmentation constructively – that means without resorting to nationalism that would just bedestructive for all of us.My topic today, then, is to look at the estimated extent of fragmentation in regulation of financialservices after Brexit and what we should do about it.2 Brexit and financial servicesIn Brexit negotiations common ground still seems hard to find. Even the basic principles of a newpartnership remain vague. Given that and because time for preparation is running out for firms,uncertainty among businesses weighs heavier every day.From an economic and financial market perspective, the two most important questions probablyare:Will there be a free trade or a comparable agreement?Would a possible free trade agreement also include financial services?In my view, there is substantial scope for a general free trade agreement. The main question tome is therefore how far-reaching can this future relationship be. For example an agreementwithout tariffs would be of high value and is possible. Another, less clear and highly complicatedquestion is how to deal with non-tariff barriers like product standard regulations.However, with a view to the financial services sector, a far-reaching free trade agreement israther unlikely given the UK’s aspired exit from the single market and the customs union.Likewise, I am rather sceptical about the approach via mutual recognition or about similarapproaches based on regulatory harmonisation through technical committees and independentarbitration mechanisms.Approaches of this kind could well undermine the ability of jurisdictions to set their own rules and 1 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
the ability to safeguard financial stability.The options that remain on the table are a “no deal” scenario or one with quite limited freedomsfor financial services, as in the case of CETA. What would such scenarios mean to financialtransactions between the UK and the EU?First, the “no deal” scenario would mean that the EU and the UK would trade under rules set bythe World Trade Organization – where services sectors are only thinly covered.Service providers would then have to apply for comprehensive licenses in both jurisdictions andhave all the necessary elements of a fully functioning bank ready in both places.And second, even a CETA-like deal would most likely not mean far-ranging freedoms to providefinancial services in the respective foreign jurisdiction.3 Living with fragmentationTherefore, it is – like it or not – quite likely that we will see greater fragmentation in financialregulation and supervision in Europe. What exactly that will mean is, however, unclear up to now.It is this uncertainty about the exact nature of fragmentation post-Brexit that makes it so hard toassess the costs and benefits of more fragmentation.Financial firms highlight that fragmentation is likely to mean organisational inefficiencies andhigher organisational costs. And there can be no doubt that at least the transition to a new regimeand new organisational structure will be costly. However, these costs may be less substantial inthe long term – once firms have adapted to the new regime, clever managers will find neworganisational solutions that integrate new compliance realities with organisational efficiencies.Significant as these costs may be, politicians, regulators, and supervisors nevertheless have totake a broader perspective, one that is in line with the changed democratic preferences.Thus, from the UK perspective, a far-reaching free trade agreement for financial services – andservices in general – could be considered an obstacle to taking back legal and regulatory power.At the same time, from the EU perspective, we cannot accept a liberalised common market,without a common supervision. Otherwise, as a supervisor, I would be concerned about financialstability. It seems therefore that some degree of fragmentation is almost inevitable.But, should we simply wait for the end of EU-UK financial relations? Should we simply hope forthe best?Of course not. We have to manage fragmentation constructively –  we have to find innovativeapproaches for a new reality.But let me make one thing very clear: this must not result in a race to the bottom. Fragmentationshould not lead to competition through lax regulation or supervision. Such policies may seem tobe in the best national interest, but ultimately they represent special interest politics. We mustexpose these policies for what they really are: threats to financial stability.And that is why politicians, firms and supervisors have to deliver on three crucial points: first, atransition agreement; second, pragmatic supervisory cooperation; and third, managerialinnovation.Let me take each of these briefly, starting with the transition – or implementation phase, as it isnow called.1 2 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
4 The need for a transition phaseA transitional deal between the UK and the EU was agreed yesterday on negotiators’ level.During the implementation phase, which is to last until end 2020, EU rules would continue toapply in the UK and the exact terms of the future partnership shall be worked out. It is of utmostimportance in order to give firms more time to adjust to the new realities.It furthermore can reduce the long-term costs of Brexit. Firms can weigh up their options anddecide which markets they want to serve and with which organisational design. They have nowtime to re-arrange their organisations on the basis of an analytical and forward-looking approach,rather than an approach of simply minimising uncertainty. The inefficiencies and potentiallyhigher costs of financial intermediation can be reduced with this agreement. I am confident that both sides have apparently recognised the importance of a transition phasein making Brexit less abrupt and, in the long run, less painful. Despite all this positive news, it is still too early to lay back. Many issues are still to be discussedand the transitional period is still not fully guaranteed. It remains to be subject to a successfulconclusion of an Article 50-deal within the next twelve months. For instance, the Irish question –i.e. keeping the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland invisible – needs tobe resolved. Hence, the recently widely used phrase that “nothing is agreed until everything isagreed” still holds true.   5 Managing financial firms in a fragmented worldBut even after a transition phase, Brexit and fragmentation would mean two things. First, futureaccess to financial services markets would be more like the access given to a third country.Second, a successful conclusion of the Brexit negotiations is not guaranteed as it depends onwhether a fully-fledged long-term agreement is achieved and ratified.This is why I see no alternative to timely preparation, and to preparing for the worst-casescenario of a hard Brexit without any free trade agreement.Looking at banks, proper preparation would include establishing at least basic entities in the othereconomic area – that is, the EU27 or the UK – in order to continue doing business there. Theconcept of a “basic entity” is not easy to define. As far as we are concerned, I can repeat that wewill certainly not accept empty shells or letterbox companies where the business effectivelycontinues to be run from London. For critical functions such as management, controlling andcompliance, qualified personnel need to be present at the EU entity at all times. We expect anybranch or subsidiary to retain chief responsibility for its business.And banks have to begin implementing their plans and submitting their license applications nolater than at the end of the second quarter of 2018. Otherwise, it will be very difficult to prevent acliff edge.Firms have a lot to complain about with regard to Brexit, and I do not mean to play this pointdown. But if the UK and the EU are attractive markets, I think there is something to be said forinnovative approaches to comply with this new regime. That’s why firms will have to find new,efficient organisational strategies. For example, I am convinced that profitable business modelscan be organised with two independently licensed entities.6 Managing regulation and supervision in a fragmented worldBut don’t get me wrong: regulators and supervisors, too, have to be pragmatic and innovative toachieve our goals of efficiency, stability, and ensuring the real economy is provided with credit. 3 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
With financial sector firms relocating their business between London on the one hand andFrankfurt, Dublin and other cities on the other hand, close supervisory cooperation becomeseven more important, especially over the coming years when we have to break new ground insupervision.The cooperation between the EU and the UK authorities will have to be put on a new foundation.We will need to ensure information exchange, and of course we will have to think about how wecan reduce unnecessary burdens from double licensing.Whatever political decision is taken, bank supervisors will not only do all they can to make thetransition to a new regime as smooth as possible; they will also, in the long run, try to reduceunnecessary inefficiencies where possible.In December last year, the PRA published a draft proposal for a post-Brexit supervisoryapproach. I very much appreciate the spirit behind this approach. It reflects a solution-oriented,pragmatic, yet stability-oriented stance. In the same vein, the SSM has developed quitepragmatic, cooperative policy stances on many of the relevant issues. I am confident that thiscooperative style can make an important contribution towards a smooth transition.7 ConclusionLadies and gentlemen, greater fragmentation will most likely be an inevitable result of Brexit.Instead of wishing to do away with what is beyond our control, we should set about findingpragmatic and at times innovative solutions to managing Brexit and the ensuing fragmentationconstructively.However, such a constructive approach will take time, because it means many complexanswers have to be developed – which is why we need a sufficiently long transition phase.And I have to say that I was really facilitated well and truly relieved when I heard the newsyesterday that a transition phase had been agreed, because this could make Brexit less abruptand, in the long run, less painful.During that phase, supervisors will have to find solutions that enhance financial stability withoutundermining economic efficiency.And financial firms will have to find innovative and pragmatic ways to comply with the newdemands while maintaining their efficiency and profitability.For all the bullet points on our to-do list, we need an honest dialogue – if unnecessary problemsand burdens arise, firms and investors should always come and talk to us. Brexit is both toocomplex and too important to muddle through.Thank you for your attention.Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement between Canada and the EU.Prudential Regulatory Authority.212 4 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
  1        “From mission to supervision” Key note speech by Klaas Knot at the Bundesbank Symposium  ‘Banking Supervision in dialogue’  Frankfurt, 7 March 2018  In his keynote speech, Klaas Knot outlines how the issue of ‘sustainability’ got on the DNB agenda, highlighting how and why sustainability is relevant for central banks, supervisors and the financial industry. Secondly, he gives an overview of the climate-risks in the Dutch financial sector. Third and finally, he sketches what this means for bank risk management and supervision.     
  2  Introduction Dear herr Dombret, herr Otto, thank for your kind introduction, and thank you very much for having me. It’s a great privilege for me to speak to you at this Symposium Banking Supervision in Dialogue.  Let me begin though by highlighting that if I would have told you 5 years ago that today at this very Symposium ”Bankenaufsicht im Dialog”, we would spend half the day discussing sustainability, not only would none of you have believed me, but most likely many of you would have taken me for a sort of tree hugger rather than a central banker.  And yet here we are today. It’s a clear indication of the significant shift in thinking that has occurred in the financial sector and in the supervisory community over the past few years. Sustainability has become more and more part of mainstream finance, evidenced by so many initiatives and examples worldwide, of which the Sustainable Finance Action Plan, which the European Commission will publish tomorrow, is only just the latest.  At De Nederlandsche Bank, which is both the central bank and the supervisor of banks, pension funds and insurance companies, we have been active on the issue for a few years now. I can imagine though that many of you might be wondering why we have been active on this issue for a few years already. What happened there? Today, in my speech ‘From mission to supervision’, I want to share with you precisely what happened. I will firstly share how this issue got on our agenda, highlighting how and why sustainability is relevant for central banks, supervisors and the financial industry.  I will then turn to a thematic review of climate-risks in the Dutch financial sector that we did in 2017, which led to a publically available report, called Waterproof. As Andreas has already explained to you how and why our economies and financial sectors could be impacted by climate change and the energy transition, I will not bore you with repeating that. Instead, I would like to share with you the outcome of our thematic review on the risks we are seeing for the Dutch financial sector. Third and finally, I will say a few things on what this means for bank risk management and supervision.  All in the hope that we all will walk away here with a better understanding of how sustainability can affect our different organizations. And convinced that it makes perfect sense to incorporate sustainability into our day-to-day operations.   I. Mission: Sustainability on the agenda of DNB Let me begin by explaining how sustainability got onto the agenda of DNB, thereby also showing in the process why this issue fits the mandate of central bank and supervisor. You see, not too long ago, sustainability to us just meant we should ensure that our coffee cups were made out of sustainable paper, and that the coffee in those cups was fair trade. Sustainability was something we certainly thought that was important, but it was not something that concerned our core tasks or our strategy as an organization. (And I’m guessing we were not the only organization to think like this.) That changed in 2011 though, when the newly appointed board of DNB concluded that probably this was the appropriate time to update the mission statement. We had to answer the question: what is our Existenzberechtigung? It’s something I’m sure many of you have had to deal with as well, whether as a supervisor or as a commercial bank. Mind you, this happened in 2011, when we had just lived through the Global Financial Crisis. Europe was still in the midst of a sovereign debt crisis, and emergency measures were taken all around us. It had become clear to us, the new board, but also to many bankers and many economists we talked to, that a significant part of the economic prosperity that our societies had created in the early 2000s, had been based on excessive leverage. Our economies had seen too much credit growth, which was not adequately backed up by underlying strong economic and financial fundamentals of companies, households and even of governments. All of these developments were in the back of our mind when we had to come up with that new mission statement for DNB.  
  3  One obvious implication of all of this being at the back of our mind, was that safeguarding financial stability was to be a crucial part of this mission. Another implication was that we wanted to incorporate an element of the general good of the societies we serve, contributing to increases in living standards and prosperity of those we serve. But there was something more, relating to all those crisis developments I just mentioned. Hadn’t the crisis taught us that the prosperity we had created in the years before the financial crisis, had proven to not be durable in the long run? Put differently, the prosperity had turned out to not be sustainable. Because that’s what sustainable means: durable in the long run.  And so, as we were walking down a foggy beach in Zandvoort, trying to come up with this new mission statement, we fortunately had the clarity of mind to add the word ‘sustainable’ before the word ‘prosperity’. Our mission as central bank and supervisors became “to safeguard financial stability and thus contribute to sustainable prosperity in the Netherlands.”  Now, of course, as we added the word ‘sustainable’ to our mission, our main thinking was in relation to the economic and financial crisis. Sustainable prosperity meant, for example, that banks should have sufficient buffers to absorb unexpected losses. But it soon became clear that the word sustainable could have broader implications.  After all, if the way in which prosperity is created today results in significant ecological damage that prevents future generations from obtaining similar or higher levels of prosperity, today’s prosperity creation is not sustainable either. And as such, it runs counter to our mission.  Of course, having a mission is just the start. As I’m sure all of you know, any policy determined at the top needs to be embedded throughout the organization to be truly effective. Therefore our policy became to incorporate relevant sustainability considerations in most of our core tasks. Of course the extent to which sustainability can and should be incorporated, depends on each of the individual tasks that a central bank/supervisor may have.  And I’m sure that the extent to which sustainability can and should be incorporated for financial institutions, will not only depend on which type of institution you are - a bank, a pension fund or an insurer - but may also differ per institution as well. For some of our own core tasks, it was quite practical.  In our payments systems task, for example. We are probably one of the only central banks in the world where 70% of our bank notes are now made out of either fair trade or organic cotton, and our goal for 2019 is to reach 100%.  For other core tasks, it was more conceptual and theoretical. As part of our economic research and advisory function, we published an exploratory study called Time for Transition. In it, we identified the upcoming energy transition, as agreed upon by more than 190 countries in Paris in December 2015, as one of our economy’s key long-term challenges. In the report we urged our government to pursue a plausible and practicable path towards a carbon-neutral economy, as such a long-term view enables households and businesses to gradually adjust their investments, preventing excessive misallocation. And we also decided to take a closer look into climate risks for the Dutch financial sector as part of our supervisory mandate.   II. Risks: a thematic review of climate risks in the Dutch financial sector Which brings me to the second part of this speech. What are the risks that we see as a supervisor in the Dutch financial sector? In 2017 we conducted a thematic review on this issue. In this review we took a deep dive into four topics:  - climate-related damages for the insurance industry - risks for the financial sector from a potential flood - risks from the financing of carbon intensive assets, so called ‘brown finance’ - risks from the financing of assets and projects that are meant to contribute to    the energy transition, so called ‘green finance’.  
  4  Today I want to share with you some key findings for banks, regarding the risks for brown and green finance. In terms of brown finance, one of the things we wanted to do was get an understanding of the size of the risks. How big of a risk is the energy transition for our banking sector? As a first step, we wanted to measure how exposed our financial industry is to sectors that need significant reforms to become carbon neutral. Sectors such as fossil fuel producers, the utilities industry, heavy industry, agriculture and transportation.   This wasn’t something that we could easily get from our supervisory data. Which is why we welcome the work that the Commission will do on developing a taxonomy for the sustainability of financial assets as part of their Sustainable Finance Action Plan. For our research, however we had to develop our own template for our financial sector to fill out. We sent this template to the three biggest banks, covering around 70-80% of the market. What we found is that banks’ balance sheet consist of around 11% of exposures to carbon intensive industries.  Not surprisingly, most of these exposures are through loans, which makes banks less sensitive to market fluctuations than for example pension funds. Moreover, most of these loans have maturities of less than five years, which should provide banks with sufficient scope to anticipate changes. Especially if the transition is more gradual in nature. In one area however, we already see transition risks materializing, and that’s in the real estate sector. The real estate sector plays an important role in carbon emissions and is therefore sensitive to the energy transition. In the EU, many, if not all, residential and commercial real estate have energy efficiency labels, ranging from A to G, with G being the least energy efficient building. The Dutch government has announced legislation that requires almost all offices in the Netherlands to have a minimum energy efficiency label of C by 2023. Any office that doesn’t meet that requirement can no longer be used. This affects banks in two ways. First, through loans to regular corporations, who use their own offices as collateral for their bank loans, and second, through loans to commercial real estate companies that lease offices as a business model. If some of these offices may no longer be used, or will need to be upgraded to meet the requirement, this could affect the value of the collateral or the ability of commercial real estate companies to pay back their loans.  So how big of an issue is this for our banks? Unfortunately, neither we nor our banks know the energy label distribution of the offices used as collateral for loans to regular corporations. For loans to commercial real estate companies, banks know of roughly 50% of those loans what the energy label distribution is. Of those loans where we did know the label distribution, we found that 46% of bank loans to commercial real estate companies in relation to offices, have an energy label lower than C. This is around 6bn worth of loans. All these loans, one could say, have elevated credit risks, which banks, one way or the other, will need to manage. Fortunately, we are seeing many banks react swiftly. Banks are now demanding that any new loan or refinancing of existing loans in relation to those offices is dependent on the client meeting the energy-label requirement on time. This should ensure that banks will have limited exposures to offices that won’t meet the deadline on time.  For us, this national legislation is a prime example of how the energy transition will lead to risks in the financial sector.  We also looked at the risks of green finance, as I mentioned. First there is the risk of a green bubble. History shows us that many transitions are accompanied by a boom bust cycle, whether it’s the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s, or the railway mania of the late 1900s. Whenever there’s increasing demand, a hype, or new market opportunities and instruments, there’s the risk of creating a new bubble. While we are still far away from a green bubble, institutions do tell us that green projects have become more and more expensive, as competition has increased with more and more institutions essentially bidding for the same projects.  A second risk we see is green washing. Do investors and consumers know what green is, when they’re buying green? There are examples of a green bond being used to make a coal plant more sustainable. In itself, there is nothing wrong with that, or at least that’s not for us to say, but what 
  5  is important is that purchasers of these bonds should be aware of this. Here, too, the work of the European Commission on a sustainable taxonomy as well as on standards for green bonds, will be most welcome.  Lastly, we are seeing an increased lobbying effort to lower capital requirements to stimulate green investments. Andreas has already touched upon this, so I won’t repeat that, other than that we wholeheartedly agree: capital requirements should remain risk based. We are thus quite skeptical of the expected plans of the European Commission in relation to prudential requirements, even though they also acknowledge the risk based nature of capital requirements.  III. Supervision: Implications for bank risk management and supervision So let me end with what this all means for bank risk management and supervision. The main conclusion is that banks, including those present today, will need to manage material climate-related risks. And that supervisors will need to supervise this.  This is of course easier said than done. If anyone in this room already knows how to exactly manage climate-related risks, please join us at the podium in a minute!  Two things are important to keep in mind here. One: incorporating climate risks is greatly facilitated when governments impose clear and long term transition legislation, which gives banks the ability to steer towards a set of well-defined goals. This is exactly what we are seeing with the energy efficiency requirements of Dutch offices.  Two, for many parts of our economies, unfortunately there is not yet any clear legislation that allows banks to anticipate such a set of well-defined goals. In those cases, banks would still do well to try and gauge how their business models and which parts of their balance sheets would be most strongly affected by the transition and which type of legislation or technological change might be expected in those sectors. It would then be prudent to try to assess potential losses as a result. Scenario analysis and stress testing would be a good tool for this.  Put differently, institutions will need to take a more forward looking approach to incorporate climate related risks. This process can fortunately be helped by implementing the recommendations of the FSB Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. Implementing the recommendations means you will need to explain your governance, risk management and strategy on climate related issues. And you will need to explain which metrics and targets you use to prepare yourself on these issues. And all of this of course means you need to have a strategy, risk management and governance system on this issue. And that you subsequently need to have targets and metrics to measure your progress in these areas.   Fortunately we are seeing many financial institutions in the Netherlands and abroad experimenting with incorporating climate risk management. One Dutch bank for example, has incorporated the energy transition into its credit policies for loans to the utility industry. This bank will only finance utilities that have carbon reduction strategies, and the bank wants the average energy mix of the utility companies it finances, to be in line with the 2 degree scenarios from the International Energy Agency.  This is precisely the kind of thinking and attitude we need, to start incorporating climate risk considerations into investment decisions.  It won’t be easy, and I’m sure it won’t be perfect at first either, but we need to start somewhere. How to precisely incorporate climate-related risks into banking supervision also remains an open question. Here too, the same two points stand out. One, when risks are already material, we can of course already assess them. If Dutch banks for example were ignoring the increased credit risk from the sustainability requirement for offices, you can be sure we would be in a serious supervisory dialogue as part of the Pillar 2 credit risk assessment. But that’s of course just one very specific example, where there is specific transition legislation affecting only a small part of our economy. It’s more challenging for the energy transition as a whole and for banks’ balance sheets as a whole. How should supervisors assess 
  6  how well banks are incorporating climate-related risks there? Do we need to establish a separate risk category in the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process as some European Parliament members are proposing? Or can and should we just incorporate it into the existing SREP-elements, such as for example credit risk? We don’t have all the answers yet, but we will continue to explore these questions in the years to come, and we hope you will join us.  One thing should be clear though: sustainability factors, and climate issues in particular, can affect the solidity of financial institutions, and therefore warrant the consideration of banks and supervisors alike. Fortunately, just a few months ago, central banks and supervisors from 8 jurisdictions, including Germany and the Netherlands, launched the Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System. This Network aims to enhance the role of the financial system to manage risks and to mobilize capital in the transition to an environmentally more sustainable world. My colleague, Frank Elderson, was recently elected as the first chair of this Network. I am grateful and excited that DNB and the Bundesbank will work together in this Network to advance this issue in the international supervisory community. Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen. Today we went from mission to supervision. I hope that the transition that DNB underwent as an organization, where relevant sustainability-considerations have been incorporated into our core tasks, has inspired you or perhaps has even sounded familiar.  But I can also imagine that some of you might remain skeptical on the appropriateness of all this. Perhaps some are still wondering: are we really discussing sustainability today? For those I would like to share something my colleague Jan Sijbrand said to me recently:  “Klaas, when it comes to sustainability, we are being criticized from both sides: there are those who say we are operating beyond the boundaries of our mandate. But there are also those who say we are doing way too little.” “To me”, he said, “That’s a clear sign we’re exactly on the track we should be.” And with that I would like to conclude for now. Thank you. 
Philip R Lane: The macro-financial environment in Ireland in spring2018Speech by Mr Philip R Lane, Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, to the Institute forInternational and European Affairs (IIEA), Dublin, 9 March 2018.*   *   *IntroductionIt is a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak at the IIEA. It is timely to provide an assessmentof the current macro-financial environment in Ireland, especially since the Spring is an importantplanning period for both public and private decision makers. For instance, the government is dueto submit its Stability Programme Update next month, while households and firms are makingconsumption and investment decisions, including in relation to the housing market.This speech has two parts. In the first part, I will review the current prospects for the Irisheconomy. The ongoing recovery in the economy means that the prospect of a return to fullemployment is in sight, even if there remain significant downside risks. Accordingly, in this part, Iwill also discuss the counter-cyclical role of fiscal policy, which is especially relevant when thebusiness cycle is not being driven by credit shocks but, rather, by other factors.In the second part, I will turn to the housing market. I will first address the recent evolution ofhouse prices and discuss the role of our mortgage measures in mitigating the risks associatedwith fluctuations in the property sector. Keeping to the topic of mortgages, I will then turn to ourpolicy stance in relation to the management of non-performing loans (NPLs). Finally, motivatedby what we have learned from the Tracker Mortgage Examination and the wave of internationalevidence on mis-conduct scandals, I will explain the priority we are placing on improving theconduct of regulated firms. Current economic prospectsLet me begin with an overview of the euro area. Based on new staff forecasts, the GoverningCouncil at yesterday’s monetary policy meeting re-affirmed its assessment that the current andnear-term economic prospects are favourable. Area-wide output grew by 2.5 percent in 2017,with average growth of 2 per cent expected over 2018-2020. By 2020, it is projected that thearea-wide unemployment rate will have declined to 7.2 percent, from its 2013 peak of 12 percentand its 2017 value of 9.1 percent. By 2020, it is also projected that the inflation rate will haveclimbed to 1.7 percent. These positive developments are supported by the broad-based growthof the global economy.The European expansion is also supported by the ECB’s accommodative monetary policy. Atyesterday’s meeting, the Governing Council decided to keep the key ECB interest ratesunchanged. We continue to expect them to remain at their present levels for an extended periodof time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases. Regarding non-standard monetarypolicy measures, we confirmed that our net asset purchases, at the current monthly pace of €30billion, are intended to run until the end of September 2018, or beyond, if necessary, and in anycase until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistentwith its inflation aim.The Irish economy meanwhile continues to perform well. In addition to the positive externalenvironment, the broad recovery in the various components of underlying domestic demand(private consumption, government spending and investment) underpins the expansion.Improving labour market conditions indicate that the economy is moving closer to a position of full 1 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
employment. Employment now stands at 2.2 million, which is 17.4 percent above the 2012trough. Of those employed, more are working full-time and the average work week haslengthened from 34.9 hours to 36.7 hours.The broad-based nature of the expansion has been a welcome feature, with employment andoutput increasing across most sectors. Total employment is returning to pre-crisis levels but thecomposition of employment shows more balance, with approximately 1 in 16 persons employedin construction compared to 1 in 9 back in 2007.We expect the unemployment rate to decline further to an average of 5.2 per cent next year,down from 6.7 per cent last year and the 2012 peak of 15.5 percent. Moreover, measures of thepotential labour supply show that there may be more labour market slack and therefore morecapacity in the economy than indicated by the headline unemployment rate. As the economy gets closer to full employment, wages should rise at a faster pace. While thelatest data show a modest pick-up in the growth rate of average hourly earnings during thesecond half of last year, our forecasts are for further increases during this year and next. Withinflation expected to remain modest over the next two years, rising wages will translate intohigher real incomes and purchasing power for households.These projections indicate the current economic prospects for the Irish economy are quiterobust. These forecasts are made based on the available data and our analysis of the factorscurrently shaping the Irish economy. At the same time, it is important to recognise the intrinsicvolatility of the Irish economy, given its high openness and extensive trade, technological andfinancial linkages to other economies. As such, unexpected events can trigger upside ordownside revisions to our forecasts, especially in relation to the longer-term path for theeconomy. It follows that public and private decision makers should ensure that choices arerobust to unanticipated outcomes, rather than putting an excessive and unrealistic reliance onour central projections.Let me discuss a few of these tail risk factors. In terms of common international risks, a reversalin the benign conditions that have characterised the financial markets of advanced economies inrecent years could spill over into the real economy, if it led to a revision in investment andconsumption plans. While the adjustment in equity markets has been limited, a more pervasiveand persistent re-assessment of future prospects or a shift in the distribution of risks would bedisruptive through a variety of mechanisms.For the euro area, it remains important to improve the resilience of the monetary union, throughappropriate national macroeconomic policies, the completion of banking union and makingprogress in capital markets union. The European Union is currently considering a further range ofdeepening measures, which will be discussed at the June European Council.For Ireland, the location decisions of multinational firms are an important driver of overalleconomic prospects. While the recent US tax reform has some clear implications for thetreasury operations of US multinationals, the net impact on geographical distribution of theproductive activities of these firms is not clear, given the complex, multi-dimensional nature ofthe new tax law. More broadly, it will be important to assess the implications of other possiblechanges in international tax systems, including in relation to the taxation of digital activities. Arelated international risk is the threat to the international trading system if there were awidespread adoption of (explicit or implicit) protectionist measures.A persistent shift in the dollar-euro rates would also be an influential factor in determining thelocation decisions of US multinational firms. While the current dollar-euro rate appears broadly inline with fundamentals, a more substantial and prolonged depreciation of the dollar would be amaterial influence in determining future location decisions. 2 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
Taken together, these trade, taxation and currency concerns mean that US-related downsiderisks require continuous monitoring and reinforce the importance of making decisions that arerobust to such adverse outcomes.Turning to Brexit, any increase in trade frictions between the UK and EU27 will generate areduction in long-term living standards, compared to the counterfactual of maintaining the statusquo. So far, the main channel by which Brexit has had a macroeconomic impact has beenthrough the 11.8 percent depreciation of Sterling against the euro since the referendum. This hasaffected exporters to the UK but also contributed to a decline in good prices in Ireland, given theimportant role of imports from the UK in the Irish consumption basket. However, the recovery indomestic demand and the positive global economic conditions has allowed the Irish economy toabsorb the impact of Brexit so far.As March 2019 draws closer, the resolution of the current uncertainty about the nature of futureUK-EU relations has the potential to generate further economic and financial volatility, especiallyif there is an increasing likelihood of a harder version of Brexit. At a macroeconomic level, Irelandis especially exposed compared to other EU27 countries, especially if there is a downward shiftin the prospects for UK economic growth or a further sustained depreciation in the value ofSterling.Furthermore, if there is a substantial shift in the regime governing UK-EU trade, there will be acostly diversion of resources to setting up new logistics and trade-processing systems. If thecosts of importing and exporting go up (including extra transit time and additional administrativeburdens), the range of imported goods available to Irish consumers and firms may shrink, whiledomestic firms will find it more difficult to access export markets.Counter-cyclical fiscal policyLet me now turn to the debate about the appropriate fiscal strategy for Ireland.A balancing act is required. In one direction, the accumulation of good news about the trend pathfor the Irish economy calls for the political system to make proportionate decisions about thepaths for public spending and taxation, given the extra fiscal capacity to meet social preferencesfor increased provision of public services, increased transfers, expanded public investment or anadjustment in the tax burden. In the other direction, the downside risks that I have just discussed(together with the still-high level of public debt) call for a prudent approach that recognises theimportance of building fiscal buffers during good times in order to enable more vigorous counter-cyclical fiscal interventions in the event of a future economic downturn.It is important to emphasise that fiscal prudence can be fully reconciled with ambitious fiscalplans. However, it is necessary to recognise the genuine trade offs that exist, especially if thelabour market returns to full employment.For instance, additions to the public capital stock can be expected to raise the productivecapacity of the economy and/or assist in the attainment of social objectives over the mediumterm. However, the process of public investment acts to raise aggregate demand in the nearterm. A stepping up in public investment under conditions of full employment may requirecounter-vailing measures to limit the risk of costly over-heating dynamics. Alternatively,stretching out a planned public investment programme over a longer horizon can limit pressureson the absorptive capacity of the economy.In this spirit, it is welcome that the recently-published National Development Plan envisages aphased approach to increasing the scale of public investment towards its medium-target of about4 percent of GNI*. A targeted approach over the medium term can address the potential cyclicalpressures associated with surges in public investment and help to ensure that private investmentis not crowded out. Research for Ireland shows that when government investment is financed in 3 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
a budget-neutral way, particularly when the economy is operating close to full capacity, thebenefits of increasing public capital can be achieved without the short-run costs of increasedmarginal costs for firms and a deterioration in competitiveness.The housing marketTurning to the second part of my speech, we published our comprehensive analysis ofdevelopments in the housing market as part of the annual review of our macroprudentialframework last November. In relation to the level of house prices, our conclusion was that thedata looked broadly in line with the values of the fundamental factors typically included in modelsof house prices. Of course, it is important to emphasise always that these fundamental factors(such as high rents) are not indicators of a sustainable or socially-acceptable housing sector butrather just capture the most influential market forces in determining house prices.An important finding is that the evidence does not support a central role for credit dynamics in thecurrent evolution of house prices. The most recent meeting of our macroprudential measurescommittee (MMC) on 19th January affirmed that aggregate credit conditions remain subdued,even if the pace of new mortgage lending has picked up.Our analysis that house prices have moved broadly in line with fundamentals is fully consistentwith a material risk of a reversal in house prices: buying a house is certainly not a one-way bet. Inparticular, international and domestic factors may trigger fundamentals-driven corrections in thehousing market. At the international level, the risk factors that I discussed earlier may generatehigher mortgage funding costs and/or a downward revision in the prospects for income andemployment growth in Ireland. At the domestic level, a desirable expansion in the supply ofhousing would put downward pressure both on rents and house prices.As the national macroprudential authority, we are committed to ensuring that the domesticfinancial system remains resilient in the event of a reversal in house prices. The ceilings we haveplaced on loan-to-income (LTI) and loan-to-value (LTV) ratios on mortgage loans are essential inlimiting systemic financial risk emanating from the mortgage market. By guarding againstexcessive mortgage debt at the household level, these measures also serve a vital consumerprotection function while also limiting the risk that a house price reversal is amplified at themacroeconomic level through deleveraging pressures on over-extended households. In relationto the financial health of the banking system, the mortgage measures are reinforced by thehigher risk weights associated with mortgage lending in Ireland under our capital requirements,together with the capital buffers we impose on systemically-important institutions.In discussing the risks associated with the housing market, it is essential also to maintain ourfocus on the legacy issues from the crisis. I next turn to discussing the management of NPLs,before turning to the financial conduct concerns that have been brought into sharp relief by themis-handling of tracker mortgages across the Irish banking system.Non-performing loansThe Central Bank’s work on mortgage arrears and NPLs spans its financial stability, prudentialsupervision and consumer protection mandates. Within the remit of the Central Bank’sresponsibilities, the approach to mortgage arrears resolution is focused on ensuring the fairtreatment of borrowers through a strong consumer protection framework, while ensuring thatbanks are sufficiently capitalised, hold sufficiently conservative provisions, and have theappropriate strategies and operational capacities to resolve arrears.While there has been progress in recent years in reducing the stock of NPLs in Ireland andacross the euro area, significant challenges remain. In the absence of pro-active management,the remaining NPL stocks may adversely affect the medium-term supply of bank credit and posefinancial stability risks through elevated uncertainty regarding the true health of the banking 4 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
system. Importantly, these risks render banks especially vulnerable in the event of a futuredownturn in the economy, such that tackling the stock of NPLs during the current benignconditions would improve the resilience of the Irish and European banking system in relation tofuture adverse shocks. For these reasons, addressing the volume of NPLs has therefore been apriority for the Central Bank for the best part of a decade.It is important to appreciate that banks can resolve NPLs through multiple channels, includingworkouts, restructures (including accounting write-offs), foreclosures and sales. Under thecurrent ECB guidance, banks are required to define their own NPL reduction strategies andchoose the most suitable solution for each relevant portfolio. It is up to banks to define realisticbut ambitious timeframes and appropriate options for each portfolio. The Central Bank and theSingle Supervisory Mechanism do not have a preference for any particular work-out modality forNPLs. This is decided upon and implemented by the executives and boards of banks.The sale of loan portfolios is therefore just one option available to banks but can play a role inmitigating systemic risk, since a wider distribution of loan ownership facilitates loss sharing in theevent of a future downturn in the economy. In cases where banks choose to sell their loansportfolios, our position is that the protections travel with the loans and that borrowers areprotected in accordance with the consumer protection framework. The 2015 Credit Servicing Actensures that relevant borrowers whose loans are sold are afforded the regulatory protectionsthey had prior to the sale, including those protections provided by the Central Bank’s ConsumerProtection Code, the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears and the SME Regulations. Under theCredit Servicing Act, if an unregulated entity buys loans from an original lender, then the loansmust be serviced by a ‘credit servicing firm’ that is authorised and regulated by the Central Bank.Looking at the evolution of mortgage arrears in Ireland, it is clear that the system has been muchmore effective in achieving sustainable solutions in relation to early-stage arrears cases than inaddressing long-term arrears. Whilst sustainable solutions can be put in place quickly forengaged borrowers that are in early arrears, the resolution of long-term arrears (the large so-called 720 days-past-due mortgage NPL group) has been a particular challenge. As at Q3 2017,16 percent of mortgages on owner-occupied homes were in restructured arrangements. There isa stock of 120,000 restructures as of Q3 2017, and 87 percent were meeting the terms of therestructured agreements. However, notwithstanding the large volume of restructuring activity, 10per cent of the value of all private dwelling home (PDH) loans as at Q3 2017 were in arrears, with7 per cent of the total value of PDH cases (or 31,624 cases) in arrears more than 720 days.The ability to acquire the underlying collateral is the cornerstone of a secured lending market.Some level of repossessions should be considered normal in a functioning system. Looking atthese patterns in a comparative context across the euro area, the high volume of cases and theextended timelines associated with repossession proceedings for residential property indicate animportant challenge for private debt resolution. Since Q3 2009, 8,195 PDH properties resulted inloss of ownership with 2,721 resulting in repossession from a court order and 5,474 propertiessurrendered voluntarily.Therefore, it is clear that NPLs have been reduced through restructuring and re-engagementbetween lender and borrower, with both banks and non-banks pursuing restructuring wherepossible. Importantly, the management of arrears has been within a policy and regulatoryframework that provides robust protections for households. Given NPLs cause suchconsiderable distress to borrowers and negatively affect their ability to contribute to the economy,recent reforms of the insolvency framework are important to give borrowers a second chance.Financial conductLet me now turn to another dimension of the mortgage market: the necessity of careful andcorrect conduct by lenders in managing each customer account. A mortgage is by far the mostimportant financial obligation for households and customers should be able to rely on each lender 5 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
to act in the best interests of consumers in the handling of mortgage accounts.The tracker mortgage scandal has had a negative impact on public trust and confidence in ourlending institutions, which were already fragile in the aftermath of the economic crisis. It is clearfrom the Central Bank’s Tracker Mortgage Examination that customer interests were notsufficiently protected or prioritised by our lending institutions.By the end of last year, the Tracker Mortgage Examination has resulted in a pay out of €316m toaffected customers. This bill will rise as the rest of the 33,700 customers that were deniedtracker products or charged the wrong rates receive redress and compensation. Through ourregulatory interventions, we will ensure that all affected customers will receive appropriateredress and compensation. In that regard, we will provide an update on the progress of theExamination in April, based on end-March data.More broadly, the Examination raises serious questions about the culture in our lendinginstitutions and the extent to which the boards and senior management of those institutions arereally living up to their promises of putting the customer at the heart of their business. In theyears since the financial crisis, there have been significant misconduct issues identified atfinancial institutions both internationally and domestically. Amid concern that such misconductcan threaten to undermine the safety of financial institutions, there is an emerging trend towardsmore intensive regulatory focus on governance and conduct issues.For example, the recent widespread consumer abuses and other compliance breakdowns atWells Fargo prompted the then Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve toannounce earlier this year she would restrict the growth of the bank until it sufficiently improvesits governance and controls. In related fashion, the Governor of the Bank of England remarkedlast year that repeated episodes of misconduct have called the social licence of finance intoquestion and recommended greater focus on improving the culture at financial services firms.We are undertaking behaviour and culture assessments of each of the five main lenders – AIB,Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank, PTSB and KBC - and will report our findings to the Minister forFinance in June.This assessment will be underpinned by the Central Bank’s enhanced Consumer ProtectionRisk Assessment model which helps us determine how financial firms identify and manageconsumer risks, including the risk that a firm’s culture does not promote and support theprotection of consumers. We are working with the Dutch Central Bank, recognised leaders in thesupervision of behaviour and culture, which will support us in the inspections.This review will shape our future supervisory and engagement strategy. Depending on what weuncover, we may require certain mitigating actions at our lending institutions. These couldinclude, for example, requiring the lenders to conduct an annual internal audit of culture; requiringthe boards of the lenders to set up ethics sub-committees; and requiring that incentive schemesdo not reward inappropriate behaviour towards customers.It is critical that regulators have a full toolkit to promote a culture of ethical compliance by firmsand the people working in those firms. We have already recommended in our submission to theLaw Reform Commission the adoption of reforms that strengthen the accountability of seniorpersonnel in regulated entities.Getting the culture right is important not just for consumers but also for shareholders, who arefaced with the substantial costs of redressing misconduct. In relation to the Tracker MortgageExamination, the main lenders have already made combined provisions of about €900m inrespect of the Examination, broken down as approximately €600m for redress and compensationand €300m for costs. 6 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
We expect the boards and senior management at our lending institutions to take the lead inrebuilding trust with their customers, their shareholders and the wider public by ensuring thatthey do not focus on short-term gain at the expense of the long-term interests of the business, itscustomers and shareholders.ConclusionsLet me conclude. In this speech, I have conveyed the views of the Central Bank on some of thekey economic and regulatory issues that loom large in our 2018 work programme. In relation tomacro-financial prospects, we welcome the ongoing flow of strong economic data, which ishelping Ireland to move beyond the legacy of the crisis. At the same time, we think that Ireland isespecially exposed to some prominent international tail risk factors. Managing this high-growthbut high-volatility profile is a major challenge for fiscal policy.Turning to the housing market, the same analysis helps to explain why the recovery in houseprices has been substantial but that, at the same time, there are material fundamentals-relateddownside risks. We view our macroprudential policy framework as vitally important in managingthese risks.In addition, we are fully committed to ensuring that the high NPL stock that remains a legacy ofthe crisis is worked through in order to build systemic resilience in advance of the next downturn.Our mission to safeguard stability and protect consumers means that we are also intent onimproving the conduct of lenders, including through the completion of the Tracker MortgageExamination and our current work on the culture of banking in this country. 7 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
Ravi Menon: Crypto tokens - the good, the bad, and the uglySpeech by Mr Ravi Menon, Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, atMoney20/20, Singapore, 15 March 2018.*   *   *Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. And to all our foreign guests, welcome to Singapore. This is a conference named after Money. Money has been with us for at least 5000 years. Andover the last 300 years or so, we have come to accept Money as being issued by central bankswhose mission in life is to safeguard its value. Now, along comes a new phenomenon – crypto money or currency or asset. The past year hasseen explosive growth in the trading and use of these crypto assets. We have also seen a roller-coaster ride in their prices.Bitcoin – the most well-known of the crypto currencies or assets – hit a high of nearlyUS$20, 000 in December last year.And then lost two-thirds of its value in just over a month.MAS has been watching the crypto space with great interest. Our views are still evolving but letme share with you the current state of our thinking and our evolving regulatory approach.I will use the more generic term “crypto tokens” rather than “crypto currencies” or “cryptoassets”.Crypto tokens began life as the medium of exchange within the blockchain ecosystem.But the token has now assumed a life of its own, outside the blockchain.Are crypto tokens money? A common use case for crypto tokens is payment. But does that make them Money? Money – as we learnt in Economics 101 – serves three functions: as a medium of exchange, astore of value, and a unit of account. No crypto token currently meets these three functions insufficient measure to qualify as Money.My colleagues on the Financial Stability Board – Agustin Carstens and Mark Carney – havespoken at length on this subject recently, with erudition and eloquence.Let me briefly echo some of the key points. With the possible exception of the dark web, crypto tokens are not widely accepted as a mediumof exchange in any market, let alone across any variety of transactionsPayment transactions in crypto tokens are often slower and more expensive thanconventional electronic transfers of funds.Crypto tokens cannot be a store of value if their prices fluctuate so much.Since the beginning of last year, the daily value of Bitcoin against the US Dollar hasfluctuated about 20 times more than the Singapore Dollar did against the US Dollar.People may buy some crypto tokens to speculate on their values. But with such volatility, Idoubt they will put their retirement savings into them.Crypto tokens also fail as a unit of account. How many entities do we know of, which maintain 1 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
their financial statements in crypto tokens? So, does it mean that crypto tokens can never become Money? With technology, we can neversay never.A second generation of crypto tokens is emerging, to address some of the currentchallenges related to network congestion, transaction time, energy costs, money launderingrisks, and importantly, price stability.Some of the best minds in the field are applying their creative energies to make cryptotokens mainstream.Not all developers and programmers in the crypto world are anti-establishment anarchists.Many may have been 10 years ago, but a growing number are married and havekids now!They know the value of stability.The litmus test will be public trust and acceptance. Basically, the history of privately issuedmoney has not been an inspiring one. Will people put their faith in Money that is not backed by atrusted public institution like a central bank dedicated to protecting its value?Perhaps – if an algorithm can mimic the reaction function of a central bank and preserve thevalue of the crypto token better than central banks can do with respect to fiat currencies.We have to wait and see.The good, bad, and ugly of crypto tokens Whether crypto tokens become Money or not, they are here and they pose a variety of issues –the good, the bad, and the ugly. Let me start with the good. As many have pointed out, far more significant than the crypto tokenis the underlying blockchain technology that these tokens help to power. The blockchain has twodistinct characteristics that hold promise.First, it is a distributed ledger. It provides a record of who owns a given asset at any momentin time and an immutable record of all transactions in that asset.Second, it is a protocol for establishing trust among diverse parties in a decentralisedsystem: where everyone has access to the same record;the data are secured by advanced cryptography; andtransactions are executed by smart contracts in accordance with pre-agreed terms.The blockchain is suited for applications where it is important to know the histories of ownershipbut there is no trusted central party or reliance on a central party is inefficient or costly.Take supply chain management for instance.  Blockchains can potentially provide the means for registering, certifying, andtracking the movement of goods across the supply chain, at low cost and low risk.Or trade finance.There are already successful proofs-of-concept by banks that show howblockchains can make the trade finance process safer and more efficient. 2 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
One of the potentially strongest use cases of crypto tokens is to facilitate cross-border paymentsin traditional currencies.This is the challenge that Singapore’s Project Ubin has set itself to solve: to use blockchaintechnology to enable entities across jurisdictions to make payments to one another:without intermediaries;with greater speed and efficiency; andat lower risk and cost. Following two successful proofs-of-concept domestically, MAS has entered a collaborationwith the Bank of Canada to test and develop a cross-border solution using crypto tokensissued by the two central banks.But as with crypto tokens, there is a fair amount of hype around blockchains.The blockchain is not a panacea to the problems of inefficiency and cost that we face inmany economic transactions and processes.It does not make sense to put everything on the blockchain.Not all use cases being experimented on will succeed.Now, the bad. The anonymity of crypto tokens has unfortunately made them well suited forfacilitating illicit transactions.A significant portion of Bitcoin transactions globally is suspected to be for illicit purposes.Questions abound as to how sanctions lists, black lists, KYC or anti-money launderingcontrols apply in crypto token transactions.Crypto tokens have also facilitated ransomware – one of the fastest growing cyber crimes.Cyber criminals inject a malware into computers and restrict their access to files, oftenthreatening permanent data destruction unless a ransom is paid – nearly always in the formof Bitcoins which do not leave a trace.Finally, the ugly. Crypto tokens have sparked a speculative fever across the world, with a viciouscycle of astronomical prices drawing a growing number of investors sparking further exponentialprice increases.History has shown us repeatedly – from Dutch tulips to South Sea stocks – that speculativebubbles eventually end very badly.The recent crash in prices ought to be a warning signal. But the marketing pitch by cryptotoken operators to seize the current lower prices as a buying opportunity only serves toillustrate how unstable, risky, and ugly this game has become.Investors in schemes involving crypto tokens may also be exposed to a heightened risk of fraud.These schemes are often conducted online by operators whose authenticity and credibility aredifficult to verify. Managing crypto risks The challenge for central banks and regulators is this: how can we harness the potentiallytransformative benefits of blockchain technology and crypto tokens while containing some of theirrisks? MAS has to-date chosen not to regulate crypto tokens directly. But we are: 3 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
focusing on the activities associated with crypto tokens,evaluating the different kinds of risks these activities pose, andconsidering the appropriate regulatory responses,all the while, seeking to ensure that we do not stifle innovation.The key risks MAS is monitoring in the crypto world are in the areas of financial stability, moneylaundering, investor protection, and market functioning. Financial stability MAS and other regulators are studying the nexus between the crypto world and the financialsystem to assess how risks to financial stability may be transmitted:market risk from the direct exposure of financial institutions to crypto tokens;credit risk through unsecured lending to crypto token businesses; andleverage when borrowers pledge crypto tokens as collateral to borrow and buy more cryptotokens.MAS assesses that the nature and scale of crypto token activities in Singapore do not currentlypose a significant risk to financial stability. But this situation could change, and so we are closelywatching this space. Given the gaps in traditional information sources, MAS is exploring some unconventional ways inwhich to gather data about the scale and scope of crypto token related activities.One, the crypto token blockchains themselves can provide a wealth of information –including time stamps, recipient and sender addresses.Two, the Application Programming Interfaces or APIs provided by crypto-exchanges presentreal-time insights on current flows in the crypto market, including information on the fiatcurrencies that are being exchanged for crypto tokens.Money laundering A clear and present danger posed by some crypto token activity is money laundering andterrorism financing.Intermediaries dealing in crypto tokens are already required to report any suspicioustransactions to the Commercial Affairs Department.In addition, the proposed Payment Services Bill will require intermediaries that buy, sell orexchange virtual currencies to specifically address money laundering and terrorismfinancing risks.Intermediaries will be required to carry out customer due diligence and put in place controlsand processes that are commensurate with their risks.Investor protection Investor protection is another immediate concern arising from the crypto mania. Where the crypto tokens represent ownership or a security interest over an issuer’s assets orany property, or a debt owed by the issuer, they may be regarded as securities under theSecurities and Futures Act.This means that unless exempted: 4 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
issuers must comply with prospectus requirements prior to the offer of such tokens;intermediaries dealing in such tokens must meet licensing requirements; andplatforms facilitating secondary trading of tokens must be approved or recognisedby MAS.With respect to the investors, MAS’ priority has been to make them aware of the risks of puttingtheir money in crypto tokens.We have advised the public to act with extreme caution should they wish to invest in cryptotokens.They could lose their shirts if prices plunge. And they have no regulatory protection if there is fraud.Market functioning There is also the issue of market integrity and functioning. Several cryptocurrency exchangesabroad have suffered cyber attacks and theft of their crypto tokens.There are also rumours and reports of rampant market manipulation and other fraudulentactivities on crypto-exchanges.We are watching with interest developments in the US, where futures contracts based on cryptotokens have been introduced on regulated exchanges. There may be some advantages herefrom a market integrity perspective. These exchanges have clear rules governing trade and post-trade activities.Such products could also potentially have a stabilising influence on crypto token prices asthey provide two-way hedging opportunities for investors.But regulation cannot address all the concerns around crypto tokens.The industry too has a part to play in strengthening the ecosystem, for instance, by adoptingbest practices around transparency, cybersecurity, and record-keeping.Guarding against Gresham’s Law I have spoken about the good, bad, and ugly of crypto tokens. To be more exact, it is the uses ofcrypto tokens that assume these qualities.Like Money, crypto tokens can a force for good or bad.Lest we forget, money is not the root of all evil; it is the love of money that is so.The same applies to crypto tokens – it is the enchantment with these tokens as a way tomake a quick buck and their abuse for illicit activities that are at the root of our concerns.There is an old axiom in economics called Gresham’s Law, which is loosely interpreted as “badmoney drives out good”.We must work together – regulators and the crypto industry – to make sure that bad moneydoes not take hold.And that a new generation of crypto tokens emerges, that harnesses the potential ofblockchain technology for social good while mitigating the risks today’s tokens pose.This is a future worth securing and I hope that some of the talents gathered in this hall will help tomake it happen. Thank you. 5 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches

Benoît Cœuré: Interview with BFM Business TVInterview with Mr Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank,and BFM Business TV, conducted by Mr Stéphane Soumier on 12 March 2018.*   *   *Mario Draghi talks about growth and he says that it is “strong and broad”. And yet, theEuropean Central Bank remains infinitely prudent. Is growth in Europe as strong andbroad as all that?It is strong, broad-based and inclusive, i.e. for the first time in a long time the whole of the euroarea is growing – all regions, all industrial sectors, and this is a new development, and verypositive. But, I should say first that inflation is not yet quite where we want it to be; the ECB’sprojections put inflation at 1.4% for next year, which is good, but not close enough to 2%. So weare not yet quite where we would like to be in terms of inflation. Second, the international risksare significant, no doubt we’ll talk about them in a moment. And third, this growth still dependsgreatly, I would even say too much, on monetary policy. According to the ECB’s econometricmodels, with a growth rate of around 2.5% in the euro area, 0.5%, half a percentage point, isdependent on monetary policy. In other words, had it not been for all the ECB’s measures,growth would not be 2.5% in the euro area, it would be 2%. And inflation would also be half apoint weaker.Still, it’s not as strong as that. In any case, the euro area still isn’t able to progress at thatpace by itself today...It is too early to declare victory. We are going in the right direction and the decision taken by theECB’s Governing Council last week, which entails changing our communication very slightly toshow that we no longer intend to increase the scale of the central bank’s monthly assetpurchases, represents a small communication step which shows our confidence. So confidenceis growing but we cannot yet declare victory.Nevertheless the market is expecting the asset purchase programme to come to an end,in September, December. What do you say to that? Is it still too early to say?No, the end is inevitable. We have always said that quantitative easing would not last forever. Wehave not yet discussed the when and how of its termination. But it’s understood, of course, thatthis is the direction in which things are going. What has not been discussed by the GoverningCouncil, however, is an increase in interest rates. It is very clear to us that short-term interestrates those the ECB controls, will remain at very low levels, well beyond the horizon of our assetpurchases.In other words, when Reuters says that the teams at the European Central Bankpresented to the Governing Council a scenario envisaging an increase in the rates inmid-2019, it’s a scenario that you are telling us you are ruling out?This is what the markets are forecasting; the ECB’s teams have Bloomberg screens likeeverybody else. But the Governing Council has never discussed this.Bloomberg or Reuters screens … Let’s respect the competition! Anyway, I’m looking atthe very latest indicators on our economic activity. Manufacturing in January was clearlydeclining in France, two months of slight pressure in Germany, with the mid-FebruaryPMI data also falling back a bit. Aren’t we levelling off now? We have finishedaccelerating and in fact the risk is that growth will fall back… 1 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
No, I don’t think that it’s worth being frightened by a few indicators. Growth is strong. There is akind of stabilisation of the growth rate, when we talk about what’s called the “second derivative”rather than growth itself. Maybe there’s a stabilisation. In a way, that strengthens the belief thatthere have to be structural measures which will take over from monetary policy. Of course, thatis the only possible direction.You have described your policy as “giving time” to all the governments to attemptreforms. Has France now taken the right road, the right direction?Yes, but it’s not the job of the ECB to give lessons to or to go into detail about what this or thatgovernment must do, because we don’t do politics, that’s not for us. We have a mandate whichis very simple, which is to bring inflation in the euro area back towards 2%. And we’re makingvery good progress towards that, but we’re not quite there yet. Then, growth drivers are needed,growth in investment, in consumption, to take over from monetary policy. For that to happen,economies have to perform better. What we see in France is in fact going in that direction. Thereis a reform momentum which I think has two dividends: one for the French economy itself andone for the euro area. France is a very large country, the second-largest country in the euro area.The euro area needs reforms and having a strong French economy is also something that canset off a series of dialogues, a series of reforms right across the euro area.France is now taking the path of that reform momentum and growth momentum?Yes, but I don’t want to judge the ways and means of the French government, or the sequence ofreforms.No, but as for the priorities set, labour law, public sector, then pensions, is it roughlywhat you recommend?Labour law, the functioning of the labour market, of course, including training, which is essential.In that respect, the good news is that the government is vigorously tackling the reform ofvocational training. This is just as important, if not more so, than the flexibility of the labour marketand labour costs. For a very long time, emphasis was placed on the cost of labour in France. Idon’t think now that the cost of labour is a major obstacle compared with Germany, comparedwith France’s competitors. However, we do have a training problem which shows up in all theinternational surveys, and it is increasingly the priority. And the government is working on it.There’s been talk of a “budgetary jackpot” this weekend, how do you regard that? Whatare your comments?It’s a slightly ridiculous discussion; I spent 15 years at the Ministry of Finance in a previous life.Whenever France’s deficit goes below 3%, there are some good souls who speak of a jackpot. Ifyou listen to them, it means that 3% will not be the upper limit of the deficit in France, it will be thelower limit; it means that the deficit will never go below 3%. Government debt is 97% of GDP. Ifour deficit remains at 3%, it is clear that we are heading towards serious debt sustainabilityproblems. So we shouldn’t listen to those good people who think that there is a jackpot when thedeficit is a fraction below 3%. It is a bit like giving an alcoholic sweet to a former alcoholic, so tospeak, it seems to me a little dangerous.And particularly because – and this is a centrepiece of your policy and I think it is themain difficulty you face – the northern European countries, a number of countries there,have been quite clear about the vague attempts at euro area reform put forward byEmmanuel Macron. Why not, but first of all your public finances have to be balanced?Not only public finances. Growth in France must become strong again, structural unemploymentmust fall and public finances must be rebalanced. This is what our partners expect, and they’reright, it’s in our interest. 2 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
And so there can be no far-reaching reform of the euro area as long as France has theseimbalances in its public finances?This has long been the case. The lack of reforms or their hesitant nature in France has long beenan obstacle to the reform of the euro area. And French politicians are partly responsible. Thisobstacle is being removed as there is a reform momentum and a downward dynamic in thedeficit. And therefore, the barriers are now increasingly in the euro area and take the form of astate of mind which keeps on wanting to set the north and south of the euro area against eachother. There is a form of political fragmentation of the euro area which persists, even as theeconomic fragmentation is declining. It’s in the heads of euro area politicians who tend to regardthemselves as being from the north, the south, although these distinctions make no sense in thatwe are all in the same boat.But how come it doesn’t make sense? These distinctions are real. Austerity is in thenorth now; it’s much weaker in the south. It is a reality and moreover you can see it in thedata.No, I don’t agree with you. Consider how Spain, a southern country, has reformed its labourmarket.The north believes that if the south is pulling through now, it’s because of the effortsthe north has made, and it is having a training effect...Say that to Spanish, Portuguese and Greek workers and employees. Tell them that if they arepulling through it’s thanks to the efforts of the north. It’s thanks to their own efforts, which werevery difficult. So there has been a reform movement that in some instances has not beencompleted, but which has been very painful for the countries of southern Europe, in the countriesthat were in crisis, and now we have to go beyond that, to turn that page, to look to the future andrebuild how the euro area functions. And to do that, we have to leave the north-south differencesbehind us.That means that, in the end, the only two problems remaining in the euro area today areFrance and Italy…I don’t think that either France or Italy pose problems. France is doing what it has to do and theFrench president is instilling a reform dynamic in the euro area. To that end, it won’t be Germanyand France alone that are going to do it, so we also have to listen to what the Dutch, the Finnsand the Irish have to say. We have to listen to them, and we will do. But France has triggered thisreform momentum and we should be grateful to it for that. As for Italy, the election took place veryrecently. There are political discussions going on right now, and it’s not for me to comment onpolitical discussions...No, but could this instability slow down the normalisation of monetary policy that youwant to implement?No, we conduct monetary policy for the euro area, not for a particular country.As for the Trump risk now, because it is like a new risk, and it was Mario Draghi whotalked about it like that, we saw this weekend that Europe as a whole, the euro area, andGermany in particular, was the first target of the trade war that Donald Trump wants tounleash, how do you view that?That’s the major risk today, it’s true. We hope that it won’t happen. But you have to look beyondthe aggressive vocabulary, beyond the bluster, and ask what is the risk of a trade war? It is a lossof purchasing power for employees, workers, starting with those in the country that implements 3 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
customs duties. The first to suffer will be American workers, it’s they who will lose their jobs. Andpossibly in the rest of the world, depending on how Europe, Japan, China react. So it ispotentially a negative shock for the global economy.One gets the feeling that Donald Trump is trying to test our unity. Do you have thatimpression too? He has been attacking Germany, German cars...I’m not going to venture to interpret what the President of the United States says...But we do need to try to find out what it means, what the impact might be…It’s sometimes difficult, but it’s true that this is an opportunity for Europe to demonstrate its unity. Ibelieve that this episode, like earlier episodes involving President Trump, reminds Euroscepticsthat Europe remains our best tool, our best form of defence, in a global economy which is fraughtwith risk and danger. There are many ways in which Europe does not function well, and there isa need for reform, for change. There are things that need to be radically reformed, but Europe isthe main weapon we have in this global landscape that is very dangerous, so it needs to bepreserved.So we need to confront Donald Trump directly with all the forces we can mobilise.We should stay away from the language of war; it’s not about confrontation. We’re notconfronting the American people, or the US economy. We’re protecting a modus operandi for theglobal economy that needs to be fair and balanced. And this fair and balanced modus operandi iscurrently under threat, so we need to defend it.Mario Draghi has said that if you impose tariffs on your allies, one may wonder who yourenemies are. There should be less escalation in the vocabulary used with Donald Trumpbecause we don’t know where that might lead...The United States is our ally.Would a minister of finance for the euro area be a strong symbol and is that somethingyou would call for?Yes, it’s a strong symbol. Personally, I’m in favour of it. This is an idea that was put forward byJean-Claude Trichet in his speech in Aachen a few years ago, when he was awarded theCharlemagne Prize. It would be a useful symbol provided it isn’t an empty symbol. So, when theheads of state and government of the euro area meet in June this year to find ways of giving newmomentum to the euro area, if the extent of the reforms is to make marginal changes to theEuropean Stability Mechanism and to give a position a new name, that won’t achieve much. Itwould be a useful symbol as long as the reality involves better coordination and more effectiveinstruments to protect the euro area.So it’s too early to talk about this at the moment? It needs to be the culmination of aprocess.It is the culmination of a process. You know, with the German government formally being set upthis week, the discussion has only just begun. We mustn’t be too impatient.Do you have the feeling that the European Central Bank has saved the euro since 2012?The European Central Bank has done everything it could within its narrowly defined mandate.And within that mandate, it has ensured the functioning of the euro area, it has dealt withspeculation, it has provided a boost that has allowed growth to pick up again and inflation tomove closer to 2%. And we did this when we could, within the mandate that we have been given 4 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
by the people of Europe.Ultimately, though, the primary mandate of a central bank – and this perhaps has beenforgotten – is to defend the currency that it issues. Without the euro, there is quitesimply no longer any reason for it to exist, and everything that implies.The Governing Council did what it did without hesitation and almost unanimously, but as hasoften been said, we don’t know what the next crisis will look like. Will we be able to do the samething when there is another crisis, which may beeven more severe, or very different in nature? Idon’t know. But the euro area needs to give itself the means to be more robust, to respond tocrises separately from, and in addition to, anything the central bank might do. This is essential forthe future. There is no guarantee that we will again be able to do what we did in 2012. We will tryto do so again, of course, but each crisis is different, so the euro area needs to make itselfstronger.In that context, you know that there is an ongoing debate which must seem unreal to youbut is real nonetheless regarding the nationality of the person who will succeed MarioDraghi. This demonstrates that European unity is failing somehow if all anyone is talkingabout is the nationality of Mario Draghi’s successor.Yes, you are completely right, this debate is symptomatic of an approach in the euro area that istoo often overly nationalistic, with everyone wanting to benefit from their membership of the euro,when it is in fact a shared project. This is a discussion which per se holds no great interest. ThePresident should be chosen on the basis of his or her merits, of course. But it reflects attitudesfrom the past. And it’s exactly what we need to leave behind now. 5 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
1-7  Opening Remarks BOT’s Policy Direction on FinTech Development Bangkok FinTech Fair 2018: SME and Consumer Financial Solutions Dr. Veerathai Santiprabhob Governor of the Bank of Thailand  Monday 19 March 2018  Bank of Thailand Learning Center   Distinguished guests  Ladies and gentlemen Swasdee krub,   A very good morning to you all. Welcome to the inaugural Bangkok FinTech Fair and welcome to the Bank of Thailand Learning Center. This Learning Center was first opened to the public in December of last year.  It is not only Bangkok’s newest learning center and public library but also an open space for individuals and entrepreneurs to collaborate and exchange ideas. So, it is fitting that our very first Bangkok FinTech Fair is held at this venue.  Over the next two days, we will be joined by some of the top minds from Thailand’s fintech and financial industry as well as regional and global leaders in financial innovation. The main discussion panels will present various issues surrounding fintech ecosystem with the focus on SME financial solutions, retail payments, and technology infrastructure; the cybersecurity room, which is in the library, will underscore the importance of cyber-awareness and highlight key security issues, ranging from emerging threats to defensive strategies; and the technology talk room and various presentation booths all over the venue will showcase some of the latest technologies and initiatives Thailand’s fintech and financial industries are working on. 
2-7    Ladies and gentlemen, On the program, this morning I am supposed to talk about Bank of Thailand’s policy direction on fintech development. Before I do so, I would like to take a step back and focus on three key words, which I believe are imperative for formulating financial sector policy for Thailand and the region as a whole. These three key words are productivity, immunity, and inclusivity.  First, an emphasis must be placed on productivity as uplifting productivity is a critical requirement for long term growth of an economy. For one, at current stage, many countries in our region are facing structural transformation of aging workforce. Shrinking workforce can dampen long term growth prospect. We must become more productive in order to increase output level and improve standard of living of our people. Productivity is also needed to boost competitiveness of businesses as expanding global trade network and emergence of large e-business platforms have introduced new competitors into our business landscape. Moreover, roles of banks could be challenged as sharing financial platforms gain prominence in the modern economy, and new fintech firms offer financial products unbundled from the long standing value chain of banking. Without meaningful adjustment—that is improving productivity, long term growth potential of an economy could deteriorate.  Second, immunity becomes imperative in the current global economic landscape. We are living in the time of changes, where outcomes can be abrupt, unpredictable, and volatile. Amidst the fallout from the Global Financial Crisis of 2008, where unconventional monetary policies flushed global financial market with excess liquidity, we are now entering the cycle where major central banks have started normalizing their monetary policies. Along the normalization path, one should expect to see market corrections 
3-7  and volatile asset prices. On top of this, rising US trade protectionism has raised concerns over global trade, investment, and production, and further measures could be retaliated. Global warming and geopolitical risks also increase in many regions of the world. Besides, rapidly changing technology could be disruptive for incumbents in many industries and also bring new forms of risks, ranging from cyber threats to strategic risks of existing business models. All these uncertainties necessitate that building sufficient immunity becomes a key consideration in any financial sector policy.  Third is the notion of inclusivity. We need to understand that any financial sector policy without consideration for inclusivity cannot be sustained. This is especially important for Thailand and many countries in our region where income and wealth inequality is one of the most pressing social and economic issues. Any policy or action that does not pay attention to the issue of inequality can threaten long-term social and economic stability, as those with higher capital can more easily reap benefits from economic growth and new technology, leaving those without access to new technology or know-how further behind. Eventually, inequality in income, wealth, and opportunity can raise social polarization, resulting in political gridlocks as seen in many countries.    Ultimately, policies that make improvements in all of these three key imperatives can uplift the real economy and standard of living of people as a whole. Productive financial sector allows for more efficient resource allocation among different segments of the economy. Maintaining a resilience financial system allows for smooth functioning of the financial markets and keeps systemic risks at bay. And, an inclusive financial system ensures that benefits from economic growth can be shared fairly across the whole society, fostering stable social and economic environment conducive for sustainable growth.     Ladies and gentlemen,  
4-7  Amidst the rapidly changing technology, fintech can be and must be an instrumental driver of financial sector policy to fulfill the three key imperatives of productivity, immunity, and inclusivity.  On productivity front, fintech can enhance efficiency in financial services. Rise of new electronic payment ecosystem can enable more efficient transfer of funds and significantly lower transaction costs for customers. Adoption of fintech platforms will allow banks to scale down on the high cost brick-and-mortar delivery model and shift to less costly and more efficient digital services. Lending process can be made much more efficient through usage of transactional data from e-commerce and payment platforms, and banks’ business model could change from collateral-based lending to information-based lending. Meanwhile, blockchain has advanced technology behind many aspects of the financial services, especially back-office operations and fund transfers. All of these help lower cost of financial transactions and improve ease of doing business for banks and customers, thereby improving productivity of the economy as a whole.   On immunity front, prudent application of fintech can help banks and businesses improve their risk management. With the vast amount of data available such as those from new payment ecosystem and digital transactions, banks can better analyze business conditions and make more accurate forecast of customers’ credit demand and credit risks, resulting in improved risk management model. Additionally, emergence of new data will unlock new hedging products, especially in the insurance industry. Furthermore, advancements in technologies like artificial intelligence, biometrics, and blockchains can help safeguard financial information, improve identity verification, and reduce the number and magnitude of financial frauds. These developments will contribute to safer environment for both service providers and customers.  
5-7  On inclusivity front, expanding fintech universe and advent of new and diverse platforms can improve financial access of customers, especially those who have been underserved by the current financial system. As different individuals have different levels of affordability and financial requirements, the ever-expanding fintech universe can offer wide-ranging choices and solutions needed to fulfill their different needs. Digitization of financial services and emergence of new platforms can improve financial services through online access and smartphone applications, which benefit customers both in cities and in remote areas. Fintech applications will also help with cross-border transactions for small businesses and enable fast and cheap remittance transfers for immigrant workers, thus creating opportunities and improving the quality of life of many whom might have been underserved. Meanwhile, information-based lending can help small businesses without adequate collateral gain access to funding at a fair price. All of these solutions lead to lower cost of financial services, greater financial access, and greater opportunity for the public.  Ultimately, “fintech” can help unlock massive potential of our people and businesses and be a powerful tool for Thailand and developing countries to improve on productivity, immunity, and inclusivity of the financial system as well as for the whole economy.  Ladies and gentlemen,   The theme of our very first Bangkok FinTech Fair focuses on SMEs and consumers, because these two groups face various challenges and can benefit greatly from the adoption of fintech. For Thailand, SMEs represent the majority of firms and make up over 80 percent of total employment. Many SMEs struggle to gain access to finance and payment services, which, on one hand, can be attributed to poor financial health due to loss of competitiveness. On the other hand, many SMEs lack the financial management skills and collateral needed for funding, and their 
6-7  cost of finance remains high. Meanwhile, the Thai public is facing big hurdles of low long-term savings and high household debts, with Thailand having household debt to GDP ratio amongst the highest in the region. Many households lack access to efficient and low-cost financial services, be it the deposit, payment, insurance or loan products. These people need to be better served by our financial system to be able to unlock their potential, improve standard of living, and ensure their financial security as they age. Despite many challenges, I am delighted that exciting developments and initiatives are taking place in Thailand and around the region using fintech to address these problems. Allow me to highlight some of these initiatives. We have:   Accounting service applications for SMEs and start-ups on cloud platforms  Online mortgage refinance portals that help select the best refinancing option for mortgage clients  Real-time and low cost cross-border money transfer and remittance platforms   Biometric verifications for e-KYC to facilitate remote access to financial services  Machine learning using alternative data such as social media for credit scoring   Real-time invoice financing through common supply chain platform  Standardized QR Code for e-payments, which has reached nearly 1 million merchants within six months after exiting from the Bank of Thailand’s Regulatory Sandbox; and last but not least  PromptPay, a real-time payment infrastructure that has facilitated electronic payments for over 39 million registered IDs in Thailand 
7-7  These are just some of the solutions available for SMEs and consumers in our market.  To this end, I believe that over the next two days we will get to see many more exciting products and projects that can inspire innovation; broaden our understanding of the current technology landscape; and help set the policy agenda for strengthening Thailand’s and our region’s fintech ecosystems, especially to serve SMEs and consumers. Seeing the extensive works put on by our staff and partners and many prominent leaders and individuals in attendance this morning make me certain that we are on the path towards fulfilling our goals.  Ladies and gentlemen, To attain the overall improvement in productivity, immunity, and inclusivity, the Bank of Thailand is committed to supporting adoption of financial technology by financial institutions and promoting fintech innovation while ensuring that key risks can be contained. Throughout the next two days I look forward to personally interacting with all participants, to learn and find ways we can collaborate for the benefits of the Thai and regional financial industries and our fintech ecosystems.  Thank you very much for participating in our very first Bangkok FinTech Fair. I wish you all a successful and fruitful event.      
Benoît Cœuré: Making our monetary union stronger and moreresilientSpeech by Mr Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, atthe Finanzmarktklausur of the CDU Wirtschaftsrat, Berlin, 14 March 2018.*   *   *Let me thank the organisers for inviting me here today.Our common monetary policy has been much discussed in recent years, also here in Germany,where the highest court has been asked to examine the lawfulness of some of our measures.While the European Court of Justice has confirmed that the ECB has acted at all times within itsmandate, many of the institutional failings which caused and perpetuated the crisis, and whichcontributed to the ECB adopting a series of unconventional policy measures, remain unresolved.These shortcomings are well known. When there’s growth and the sun is shining, euro areaMember States have few incentives to pursue sound policies and keep their economiesproductive and flexible enough to prosper in a monetary union on a sustainable basis. Thisleaves them vulnerable when rainy days come.In such an environment, where the governments of the 19 Member States have retained coreresponsibilities in crucial areas such as fiscal policy, business environments and labour marketpolicies, the central bank can quickly become a scapegoat or be the focus of unrealisticexpectations. Worse, there is hardly a single European public discourse in which the commonmonetary policy can be communicated. Take the title of this panel as an example. Theconnotation that people attach to the term “Nullzins” will likely be different from, say,“geldpolitischer Impuls” – although both terms in essence describe the same thing.Worse, monetary policy can quickly become overburdened if national fiscal and economicpolicies fail to internalise the effects they have on the common currency. The temptation to free-ride is always present in a monetary union. It is easy to see that if fiscal policy is loosened duringan expansion, or tightened during a recession, the burden on the central bank to stabilise theeconomy increases mechanically.Even today, euro area growth still relies too much on monetary policy support. According to ECBstaff estimates, the contribution of our easing measures to annual euro area GDP growth washalf a percentage point in 2017 and will still be around one-third of a percentage point in 2018.And monetary policy can do little to lift the long-term growth rate of our region.All of this means that our currency union needs further reform – both at Member State and euroarea level. I believe there is wide agreement on this. Where we still lack agreement, however, ison how these reforms should look in practice.I have described elsewhere the requirements of reform from the perspective of the singlemonetary policy. As the central bank of the euro area, we have a stake in the success of thecurrent discussion. Without further reforms, and depending on the nature of the next crisis, wemay well be forced to test the limits of our mandate – a concern that has been voiced byGermany in particular.I offered three “lines of defence” that any well-functioning monetary union depends on: flexiblemarkets, adequate national fiscal buffers and a common fiscal instrument to cope with largeshocks.The logic is simple and compelling. Flexible markets for goods, services, labour and capitalreduce the need for costly macroeconomic stabilisation and curb contentious debates about1 1 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
crisis management. They reduce both the likelihood and impact of shocks and allow economiesto bounce back more quickly. And they save much of the precious political capital governmentshad to spend on acrimonious crisis discussions.But flexible markets come at a price. In a downturn, they often impose economic hardship onworkers through job losses or wage cuts. Governments can mitigate these effects. Unlike theUnited States, however, the European Union is not a federation. This means that – as a rule –stabilisation needs first to take place at Member State level. Building and maintaining adequateroom for action at national level is therefore essential. This is what our fiscal rules are about. Andcontrary to common perceptions, this is not only about bringing general government deficitsunder the 3% line, but it is also about bringing them closer to balance or to surplus in the mediumterm so that fiscal space can be used in the event of a recession.But even ex ante solvent governments can come under pressure in the face of very largeshocks. Absent national stabilisers, such as an autonomous monetary policy and exchange rate,such shocks have already tested the cohesion of the currency union as a whole. This is why acommon monetary policy needs a complement in the form of a common fiscal instrument thatcan support – under proper democratic control – aggregate demand if need be.Many of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) reform proposals that are currently beingdiscussed would help bolster these three lines of defence.Enhancing national ownership of structural reform efforts, for example, could help make oureconomies more agile. A true capital markets union, leveraging the benefits of fintech innovation,would significantly boost the capacity of our financial markets to diversify and reduce risk, whilethe ECB has often argued that a European deposit insurance scheme is a precondition for a trulyintegrated banking system and safe money. And the Single Market still has a lot of untappedpotential, in particular in the field of services. These should be priorities.More credible fiscal rules and greater market discipline would strengthen the second line ofdefence. A nimbler European Stability Mechanism, meanwhile, together with steps towards anarea-wide stabilisation budget, could effectively complement the euro area’s institutionalarchitecture.Reforms along these lines are needed to help us create a more stable and safer currency union.A stable, resilient and more integrated euro area is in everybody’s interest, including, and maybeespecially so, Germany’s. That is why Germany for decades joined forces with its Europeanpartners to strengthen the European Union, including by establishing a monetary union. It isreassuring to see that the coalition agreement gives strong support to the European project.Indeed, governments and parliaments of Member States, together with the European Parliament,must be the driving force in this process.This is particularly important at a time when the multilateral order based on cooperation is beingchallenged, at a time when one of Germany’s long-standing partners, the United Kingdom, isabout to leave the European Union, and at a time when anti-European forces, elected andunelected, in other parts of the Union are calling into question not just the EU’s four freedoms butalso the values of an open, free and democratic society.In this environment, Germany, as one of the founding members of the Union, has a responsibilityto promote and nurture a reform debate that is constructive and that will help to bridgedifferences of opinion. A strong Franco-German commitment is a necessary condition formoving forward, but all Member States have to be on board. It means that we should movebeyond the north-south divide which has too often shaped past discussions on EMU. Economicfragmentation is receding on our continent, thanks to a broad cyclical recovery, the ECB’sactions and the bold reforms initiated in several countries. We should be careful not to allow 2 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
political fragmentation to jeopardise these achievements.Ultimately, what matters is that we strike the right balance between solidarity and responsibilityand that we embrace a vision which secures the integrity and resilience of the euro area. We allknow that this is not easy. But failure to do so would leave the ECB alone at the forefront ofmacroeconomic stabilisation in the euro area. This is a risk not worth taking.Thank you.See Cœuré, B.

Christopher Kent: Australian fixed income securities in a low rateworldAddress by Mr Christopher Kent, Assistant Governor (Financial Markets) of the Reserve Bank ofAustralia, to the Debt Capital Markets Summit, Sydney, 14 March 2018.*   *   *I would like to thank Leon Berkelmans for help in preparing this material.This is my first time at the Debt Capital Markets Summit. I appreciate the opportunity to speak atsuch an important event in the Australian fixed income calendar.Over the course of recent months, interest rates on a range of fixed income securities acrossthe globe have risen. Nevertheless, they remain at historically low levels. At the same time,spreads between non-government and government debt have remained low. Indeed, over thepast year or so they have declined to be around their lowest levels since the global financialcrisis. Accommodative monetary policies and generally low levels of inflation are contributing toeasy financial conditions for issuers.In my presentation today, I’ll lay out some of the factors contributing to these financial conditionsand then discuss how Australian issuers have responded. In brief, more has been issued, by amore diverse set of issuers at longer average tenors. I’ll finish by looking forward to the yearahead.The global storyTo tell the story on pricing, for the most part I’m going to focus my attention on spreads betweenyields on non-government debt and those on government debt. That’s a familiar way of thinkingabout a key part of cost of those funds. At the same time it provides a sense of the market’s viewof the risks involved.Globally, spreads on non-government debt are low and they have tightened further over the pastyear. Indeed, spreads in many markets are as low as they have been since the financial crisis.For corporate bonds that’s true of both investment grade and non-investment grade debt(Graph 1). In short, demand for fixed income securities is strong.1 1 / 15BIS central bankers' speeches
Why might that be? One contributing factor has been the improvement in global economicconditions. This is supporting business profits, which helps to reduce actual and prospectivedefaults. In turn, this underpins a narrowing of credit premia. We see evidence of this, forexample, in the decline in default rates on high-yield US bonds over the past few years, althoughsome of the decline since last year may also reflect the improvement in conditions affecting USoil producers.Another part of the story may be that uncertainty has declined. This has been most evident in thelow levels of financial market volatility observed last year and early this year. That suggests thatmarket participants are more confident about their forecasts of the future. A sense of greatercertainty is consistent with the reduction in the variability of many key macroeconomic indicators,which has been accompanied by a decline in revisions to analysts’ forecasts of these variables.Yet another possible reason for the low spreads is that financial market participants appear to bewilling to take on risks at lower levels of compensation. In other words, the price of risk may havedeclined. This could be as a consequence of a few developments. Importantly, accommodativemonetary policies have provided investors with an incentive to take more risk so as to achieve areasonable rate of return. As investors take on more risk, they will tend to bid down its price – ascaptured by spreads, for example. This is the search for yield that we hear about a lot.Why does this matter for Australia?So what is the relevance of the decline in spreads on offshore fixed income assets for Australianmarkets?First, it matters because many of our corporations issue overseas. This offshore issuancefacilitates capital inflows, which are the financial counterpart to Australia’s current accountdeficit.23 2 / 15BIS central bankers' speeches
Most bonds issued by Australian companies are issued offshore, whether they are financial ornon-financial companies (Graph 2). For non-financial companies, the influence of mining firms inthis market had been significant over recent years. Overseas issuance is quite natural for minersoperating in Australia because their revenue streams are often denominated in foreigncurrencies.Second, the decline in spreads offshore also matters because they are highly correlated withspreads in the domestic market (Graph 3). For example, spreads on bonds issued by Australianbanks in the Australian market have a strong relationship with the spreads faced by UScorporations. The same is true for spreads on bonds issued by non-residents in the Australianmarket (so called ‘Kangaroo bonds’). This should not be that surprising because the market forcapital is a global one. If the price of risk in Australia were to deviate too far from the global price– beyond that suggested by any differences in fundamental credit quality – there would beopportunities for profitable arbitrage. One way or another, the process of arbitrage would lead toa degree of convergence between spreads. 3 / 15BIS central bankers' speeches
The responseSo spreads have declined in Australia, much like the rest of the world. Is that the end of thestory? Far from it. Non-government issuers have responded to these developments in a numberof ways.Low spreads have made it more attractive for companies to issue fixed income securities.Issuance is up across a range of markets. But quantities are not the only part of the story. Gooddemand conditions have also made it easier for a more diverse range of companies to issue.Moreover, tenor has increased, notably in the domestic market.QuantitiesLet me start with quantities.Issuance in many markets is up. Gross issuance of bank bonds in 2017 was the secondhighest since the global financial crisis (Graph 4). In 2016, banks acted ahead of time inpreparation for the implementation of the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) requirement. So,having issued a bit more paper in 2016 than had been the case for some time, it seemedreasonable to have expected that 2017 was going to be a somewhat subdued year for bank bondissuance. As it happened, though, banks took advantage of favourable funding conditions overthe past year or so to tap the bond market more actively than might otherwise have been thecase.4 4 / 15BIS central bankers' speeches
Corporate bond and Kangaroo issuance rebounded from their 2016 levels in 2017, although therehave been recent years where issuance was higher.Issuance of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) was particularly strong in 2017.Indeed, it was the strongest since the global financial crisis. Part of that is likely to have owed toextra issuance by non-banks (i.e. financial institutions that are not authorised deposit takinginstitutions, or non-ADIs). Their housing lending picked up strongly at the same time as thegrowth of lending by the major banks was easing. (That in turn reflected the decline in the growthof the major banks’ investor and interest-only loans as the banks responded to the AustralianPrudential Regulation Authority (APRA) and Australian Securities and Investments Commission’s(ASIC) actions to tighten lending standards.) Despite these supply-side motivations, it stillappears that demand-side factors were the dominant influence. If the only influence on RMBSspreads had been via increased supply of paper from non-banks to fund their lending, thenspreads would have increased. However, spreads have tightened, consistent with a rise in thedemand for RMBS.DiversityThe RMBS market is an important source of funds for mortgages issued by smaller competitorsto the major banks. So, it’s reasonable to expect that low spreads should encourage some moreof those competitors to come to the market. Indeed, that’s what we have seen (Graph 5). As awhole, non-major banks (labelled as ‘other ADI’ in the graph) issued $16 billion of securities lastyear, the highest since 2007. Perhaps more remarkable was the number of ‘other’ (non-major)banks that issued RMBS – by our count it was 17, the highest ever. 5 / 15BIS central bankers' speeches
Interestingly, major banks have been relatively inactive in this market. Only 13 per cent of the totalvolume of issuance in 2017 was accounted for by the majors, the lowest since 2010. Onereason the majors have not been more active is that, even with the decline in RMBS spreads,pricing is not particularly attractive for them. Rather, alternative sources of funds – such asunsecured wholesale markets – remain more attractive because spreads in those markets havealso narrowed. It’s worth noting that many of the other banks, and non-bank securitisers, haverather limited access to long-term wholesale funding, particularly in offshore markets. So theycannot avail themselves of the favourable terms currently on offer there.An alternative way of showing the increase in diversity is through a Herfindfahl-Hirschman index,which is a standard way of measuring concentration. The lower the index, the lower the level ofconcentration. There was a sizeable fall in that index in 2017 for RMBS issuers (Graph 6). Bythis metric, concentration has been falling since 2014, when non-banks issued less than halfwhat they did in 2017 and major banks were far more active in the market.5 6 / 15BIS central bankers' speeches
The diversity of issuers has increased in other markets as well. I have made the point in aprevious speech that the mining industry is an important part of the Australian corporate debtmarket. For a number of years following the financial crisis, those companies issued debt tohelp fund the mining investment boom, although most finance was raised internally. Over thepast couple of years, however, resource-related companies have been relatively inactive; somehave even bought back bonds as they have sought to reduce their gearing (thereby contributingto the decline in offshore bonds on issuance for non-financial corporations shown in Graph 2).Meanwhile, other companies have stepped up their issuance (Graph 7). In 2017, we sawparticularly strong issuance from utility companies. Indeed, combined issuance across non-resource-related sectors was at a record high in 2017. I should note that we would expectissuance to grow in nominal terms as the economy expands. Regardless, it is worth noting thatthe market is not dominated by resource companies in the way it has been in the past.67 7 / 15BIS central bankers' speeches
We also have seen a more diverse type of issuer in the Kangaroo market. Again, this is not astory of the past year alone (Graph 8). If we look back 10 years, the Kangaroo market hadpreviously been reliant on financial corporations and European based supranational, sovereign orquasi-sovereign agency entities, known collectively as SSA’s. However, as time has passed, wehave seen more non-European SSA’s enter the market. Also, over the past three years or so,non-financial corporations have begun to issue in the Kangaroo market, such as companies fromthe United States. 8 / 15BIS central bankers' speeches
This increase in the variety of the types of issuers in the Kangaroo and non-financial bondmarkets can also be summarised by Herfindahl indicies (Graph 9). These show a clear decreasein concentration over the past few years, with the indices reaching their lowest levels for sometime. 9 / 15BIS central bankers' speeches
TenorFinally, another development worth highlighting is the lengthening in the tenor of issuance insome parts of the market in 2017 (Graph 10). In the case of domestic issuance for non-financialcorporations, this increase is part of a longer-running trend, which has been a positivedevelopment for domestic markets. Recent increases in average tenor more generally may alsobe related to the low levels of spreads.In the case of overseas issuance by Australian banks, 2017 saw some notable deals with quitelong tenors. We understand that this lengthening of tenor by the banks has been influenced bymarket conditions. In particular, banks are taking advantage of the lack of any term premium forlonger-term funding. The regulatory environment, particularly the NSFR requirement, may also becontributing to a desire to issue at longer tenors.You may have noticed that offshore issuance tends to be at longer average tenors than domesticdeals. It seems that it is easier, or at least has been in the past, to borrow at term overseas thanin the Australian market. By all accounts, Asian investors have helped support longer-termAustralian dollar issuance of late. It does not yet seem to be the case that resident investors areable to provide the demand needed for a large volume of longer-term issuance, although thatcould evolve over time.8 10 / 15BIS central bankers' speeches
Where to now?These developments I’ve summarised have generally been positive. To recap, accommodativemonetary policies and greater confidence in the outlook for global growth have contributed to lowspreads on a range of non-government debt. Australian issuers have benefited, with greaterissuance, across a more diverse range of issuers and at longer average tenors. But the outlookis not without risks.Indeed, accommodative monetary policies have encouraged greater risk-taking by both lendersand borrowers. This is one of the important ways in which the monetary transmissionmechanism works. It has supported the decline in spreads and other positive developments I’vejust discussed. At the same time, however, the combination of low interest rates and low volatilityin financial markets is of concern to the extent that it can lead to excessive risk-taking via asearch for yield. This is something that the Reserve Bank has been noting for a time.Is there evidence of excessive risk-taking in fixed income markets? It’s hard to say. Spreadshave been bid down across a range of Australian markets to levels that are close to those thatprevailed ahead of the global financial crisis (Graph 11). However, spreads for RMBS are notquite so low relative to that history (Graph 12). First and foremost, this reflects thereassessment at the time of the crisis by investors globally of the risk of this type of asset. Thatassessment has persisted. Also, it may be that the spread is somewhat higher in Australia than itwas a few years ago in response to the build-up of risks in housing markets and householdbalance sheets – on the back of high and rising household indebtedness. We have talked aboutthat at length for a time now.91011 11 / 15BIS central bankers' speeches
 12 / 15BIS central bankers' speeches
It’s not clear that the relatively low level of spreads in fixed income markets represents irrationalmispricing of risk or is, by itself, a cause of concern. Issuance has picked up, but it is notespecially high. Moreover, measures of corporate indebtedness are generally not elevated(Graph 13). This has been helped by some deleveraging among resource companies, whichhave been able to reduce the extent of their debt.12 13 / 15BIS central bankers' speeches
Still, it is possible that we could see a noticeable pick-up in financial market volatility, a sharp re-pricing of assets and, as a result, a tightening in financial conditions, including higher spreads forcorporate issuers.The recent experience in US equity markets has been a stark reminder of that possibility. WhileUS equity markets reacted sharply, and other equity markets around the world responded(though generally to a somewhat lesser extent), the knock-on effect to other markets wasmodest. In particular, spreads on corporate debt were little changed.My sense is that this limited response of spreads reflected at least two features of the bout ofequity market volatility. First, the sharp response of the US equity market was driven, at least inpart, by some sizeable positions that had been taken on the back of an expectation that volatilityin that market would remain low.Second, the equity market turbulence was triggered by a reassessment of the outlook for USinflation and monetary policy. In particular, there was evidence of stronger wages growth and aprospect of rising inflation. It would be appropriate and welcome in that case to see a tightening infinancial conditions. If that were to be sustained, it would naturally be accompanied by areduction in the search for yield and some increase in spreads, which would tend to weigh onissuance. While there’s nothing that guarantees that the path of adjustment will be smooth andpain free, the forces that might push the US economy in that direction are not unwelcome in ofthemselves. And while other advanced economies are further from that point, including inAustralia, the expectation is that these same forces will come into play as spare capacity isgradually eaten into and inflation rises.Thank you for your attention. I look forward to answering questions you might have. 14 / 15BIS central bankers' speeches
An important aspect of that is default risk, which I suspect is the thing many people have in mind when I mentionrisk. However, these spreads will also incorporate liquidity premia – government bonds tend to be quite liquid,and that will also affect their pricing vis-à-vis private sector debt.For further discussion of this point, see RBA (2018), ‘Box A: The Period of Low Volatility in FinancialMarkets’, Statement on Monetary Policy, February, pp 25–26.Debelle G (2017), ‘Recent Trends in Australian Capital Flows’, Address to the Australian FinancialReviewBanking and Wealth Summit, Sydney, 6 April.The data in Graph 2 show that the outstanding stock has fallen in overseas markets recently. These datainclude the effect of issuance and maturities of bonds, as well as exchange rate movements and bondbuybacks.If the market is accounted for by only one player, this index is 1. If, on the other hand, n participants each have anequal share of the market, the index is 1/n.Kent C (2017), ‘Fixed Income Markets and the Economy’, Address to Bloomberg, Sydney, 9 August.Arsov I, B Shanahan and T Williams (2013), ‘Funding the Australian Resources Investment Boom’, RBA Bulletin,March, pp 51–61.For example, see Davidson L (2018), ‘Taking Stock’, KangaNews, Dec 17/Jan 18, pp 12–13.

Bank of Italy – CEPR ConferenceLabour market participation: Forces at work and policy challengesWelcome address by the Deputy Governor of the Bank of ItalyLuigi Federico Signorini Centre “Carlo Azeglio Ciampi”Rome, 15-16 March 2018
   Ladies and Gentlemen, it is a pleasure to welcome the participants to the Bank of Italy-CEPR conference on ‘Labour market participation: Forces at work and policy challenges’. 1  A well-functioning labour market is essential for sustaining growth and maintaining social cohesion. The purpose of this conference is to improve our understanding of the secular changes affecting both labour supply and demand, the attendant threats and opportunities, and the policy challenges. I shall briefly discuss these changes, look at some of the policy measures already undertaken in various jurisdictions, and propose a few open issues for discussion. Trends in labour supply In Europe, labour force participation has increased considerably over the past few decades and, despite marked heterogeneity across countries, has now drawn level with the US. According to the latest data, it was equal to 73 per cent in 2017, around ten percentage points above the level recorded in the early 1980s.  There are three main drivers of this development.  The first is the growing involvement of women in market work. Female participation in the EU has increased by about 20 percentage points since the early 1980s, reaching 68 per cent in 2017. This reflects various factors: technological progress that has reduced the time required for unpaid household work, greater availability of flexible working arrangements, increased supply of affordable childcare services and more sharing of household work between men and women. With reference to the US, the contribution of female employment to the occupational structure will be the focus of one of the papers to be presented this morning.2 The second driver is increased education, a feature that is positively associated with labour market attachment. In Europe, the share of individuals aged 20-64 with academic or advanced professional education rose by around 10 percentage points in the last 15 years, reaching 30 per cent in 2017. The greater labour market attachment of persons in central age brackets has more than compensated for the lower participation of younger individuals, who now tend to remain longer in education.  1 I wish to thank Eliana Viviano and Francesco D’Amuri for their assistance in preparing this speech. 2 Cerina, F., Moro, A., and Petersen Rendall, M. (2018), ‘The role of gender in employment polarization.’                                                            
The third driver is migration. Immigrants’ labour market participation is high, and their share in the working age population has increased significantly in developed countries (e.g. in Europe from 4.4 per cent in 2002 to 8.2 per cent in 2016). Few papers in the literature have found a negative impact of migration on employment of host-country workers; on the contrary, given that foreign-born and native workers have different skill sets, their respective labour services are often found to be complementary.3  The positive contribution to labour market participation of some demographic factors is likely to slow in the future. Notably, the baby-boom bulge in the age structure, which for a long time has sustained the share of working-age population, is now starting to push up the share of retirees. For given retirement rules, ageing reduces the participation rate. According to the European Commission,4 however, the share of active individuals aged 20-64 will still increase by 3 percentage points between 2016 and 2070, owing in part to increases in the statutory retirement age in many countries.  Future trends in migration are exceedingly difficult to predict. Migration pressures are likely to increase, as more people in less-developed countries cross the threshold between absolute poverty (which affords no opportunity to move) and that condition where one has acquired the minimum amount of knowledge and resources required to pursue a better life elsewhere. On the other hand, in developed countries issues about the social acceptability of immigration loom increasingly large in the political debate and the management of migrants’ flows and their integration are highly controversial. Trends in labour demand Trends in the demand for labour are driven by the twin primal forces in contemporary economies: technological progress and globalisation. Many fear that downward pressures are deriving from both of these forces in the advanced economies. Historically, there have always been concerns that technological innovation would have negative effects on employment, especially during downturns. In this never-ending debate, views have been rather disparate, with prominent economists occasionally – and not always prudently – venturing into dismal predictions. In the third edition of his Principles of political economy and taxation (1821), Ricardo wrote: ‘The opinion, entertained by the labouring class, that the employment of machinery is frequently detrimental to their interests, is not founded on prejudice and error, but is conformable to the correct principles of political economy’.5  3  Peri, G. (2016), Immigrants, Productivity, and Labor Markets in Journal of Economic Perspectives, 30(4). 4  European Commission (2018), Ageing report 2018 - Underlying Assumptions and Projection Methodologies. 5  Ricardo, D. (1821), The Principles of Political Economy & Taxation. London: New York: J.M. Dent; E.P. Dutton, reprinted in 1911.                                                             3
In his famous essay ‘Economic possibilities for our grandchildren’ (1930), Keynes wrote: ‘We are being afflicted with a new disease of which some readers may not yet have heard the name, but of which they will hear a great deal in the years to come – namely, technological unemployment. This means unemployment due to our discovery of means of economising the use of labour outrunning the pace at which we can find new uses for labour.’6 He also thought that in one hundred years there would no longer be a need for humans to work much at all. Three hours of work per day would suffice to satisfy the ‘old Adam in most of us’, he said, that is, mankind’s innate urge to produce with ‘the sweat of his brow’. We have twelve years left to reach this goal.7 In the words of Mokyr et al.,8 ‘if someone as brilliant as David Ricardo could be so terribly wrong in how machinery would reduce the overall demand for labour, modern economists should be cautious in making pronouncements about the end of work.’ Our experience so far is that, in the long run, technological change improves living standards by boosting productivity and increasing output and consumption, without destroying jobs in the aggregate.9 Average working hours have indeed come down, but they are nowhere near the level Keynes imagined. Doomy predictions suggesting that machines would at a certain point in the future have ‘an absolute and a comparative advantage over humans in all activities’10 are likely to prove misplaced.11  However, technological advances do imply changes in the occupational structure. In recent years, many have detected one such change in the form of a ‘polarization’ of the labour market. Middle-range jobs involving routine-intensive tasks, which can be easily automated, have been hardest hit; as a share of total employment, they have fallen by about 7 percentage points in the US and 9 points in Europe.12 At the same time, increased employment opportunities have arisen at both ends of the skill distribution. The demand for high-skill professionals has increased because their skills complement technology. But the demand for low-skill workers has also increased, because jobs that are intensive in certain manual tasks (such as personal care services) are not easily replaced by technology, while greater productivity in the rest of the economy and higher incomes translate into greater demand for such services. 6  Keynes, J.M. (1930), ‘Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren’, in Essays in Persuasion, New York: W.W. Norton & Co., reprinted in 1963. 7  Ibid, Chapter II. 8  Mokyr, J., Vickers, C. and Ziebarth, N.L.

Middle-skill occupations include jobs classified under the ISCO-88 major groups 4, 7, and 8 (clerks, craft and related trades workers, and plant and machine operators and assemblers).                                                            4
Globalisation reinforces this trend. Stronger international competition favours the rise of ‘superstar’, winner-takes-all firms, thus improving the conditions of their workers (not to mention their owners or managers) over all others. At the same time, in many advanced economies delocalisation depresses the demand for intermediate-skill workers employed in the production of tradable goods.  The implications in terms of income polarisation are not always obvious. One paper that will be presented here shows that the increase in labour demand at the opposite poles of the skill distribution has also generated endogenous supply responses, such as higher female labour market participation and a rise in immigration.13 Another paper shows that more innovative firms pay higher wages not only on average, but even to low-skilled workers.14 However, while the long-run effect of technological change, based on historical evidence, is likely to be entirely beneficial, in the short run disruptions and displacements are to be expected, and many jobs will be at risk. Policies cannot ignore this. Reforms The challenge is therefore to find ways to enable economic systems to reap as many of the long-run benefits as possible, while alleviating any short-run costs of structural change. While a unique first-best solution does not exist, both theory and experience point to the usefulness of certain structural reforms to foster widespread, inclusive growth of employment opportunities.  I shall briefly mention three policies that are (or should be) on the agenda of most countries: (i) measures to sustain participation; (ii) measures to improve human capital; (iii) measures to make structural adaptation easier and fairer (‘flexicurity’). Sustaining participation – There are three main developments that can affect participation: • achieving gender parity in participation rates; • extending the working life; • managing migration flows and effectively integrating immigrants. Progress in women’s participation has been substantial in Europe, but in most countries parity remains a distant prospect. The difference between male and female participation rates is currently around 10 percentage points in the European Union and in the United States; despite recent progress, the difference is twice as large in Italy. More flexible working hours and family-friendly workplace arrangements are two ways of 13  Basso, G., Peri, G. and Rathman, A. (2017), ‘Computerization and immigration: theory and evidence from the United States’, NBER WP 23935. 14  Aghion, P., Bergeaud, P., Blundell R. and Griffith, R.

achieving more inclusive participation (and, incidentally, a more equitable distribution of household chores). In many European countries there is plenty of scope for further improvement, e.g. concerning the supply of childcare facilities. The continuing increase in life expectancy makes raising the retirement age unavoidable to ensure that pension systems are sustainable; this in turn is bound to result in higher participation rates in the older age brackets. Many European countries are revising, or need to revise, their public pension systems. According to the assessment made in the Macroeconomic Imbalances Procedure by the European Commission released one week ago, 12 members of the European Union have issues concerning the long-term sustainability of their public finances, partly due to pension expenditures.15 For those countries that adopted ambitious reforms it is important not to backtrack on them in the future.  Already legislated pension reforms will imply in Europe, between 2016 and 2070, an increase in the statutory retirement age of more than two years;16 the impact on labour force participation for the 55-64 age class will be substantial (12 percentage points). The increase will be much stronger in Italy, where radical reforms enacted gradually over the past two decades have transformed what used to be one of the least sustainable public pension systems into one of the most sustainable. Between 1990 and 2016, average age at retirement had already increased from 57 to more than 62; it is expected to have increased by a further five years by 2070. Participation rates in the 55-64 age class are projected to be among the highest in large European countries. (Let me add that we need to revise the age brackets we typically use: ‘65+’ can no longer be taken as synonymous with ‘presumed retired’.) One might think that an ageing workforce would be less productive or innovative, or that grey heads keeping their jobs for longer will displace younger workers. There can be different points of view on this. On the one hand, recent research concerning Italy17 shows that the unexpected increase in the employment of mature workers that took place after changes in public pension rules in 2012 did not reduce employment in other age classes. On the other hand, a paper18 to be presented tomorrow finds a negative impact of ageing on dynamism and growth.  Managing migration is the trickiest challenge of all. Good, dispassionate, data-based economic research may help set the stage for an informed public-policy debate. One paper that will be presented tomorrow19 on the impact of the regularisation of undocumented migrants on the labour market in Spain is very much in this spirit and provides interesting, nuanced results.  15  European Commission (2018), European Semester Winter Package: reviewing Member States’ progress on their economic and social priorities. 16  European Commission (2018), The 2018 Ageing Report: Underlying Assumptions and Projection Methodologies. 17  Carta, F., D’Amuri, F. and von Wachter, T.

Education – The improvement in the education level of the European workforce during the past ten years is partly due to targeted policies (though the latter differ greatly across countries). For all the progress that has been made, however, there is evidence that European education systems are still struggling to equip workers with the skills they need.  A recent survey20 shows that, especially in southern European countries, an increasingly large share of workers are both over-educated, i.e., they received extra education not required for the job, and under-skilled, i.e., they lack certain specific task-related abilities. This suggests that many European education systems have not quite succeeded in integrating general and vocational education in an efficient, balanced way. The former appears to be biased towards purely academic knowledge, and to neglect the adaptable, problem-solving abilities required in the labour market. The latter focuses too narrowly on specific skills, which raise employability in the short term, but rapidly become obsolete.21  In respect of education, Italy has a problem of its own. Indicators of formal education (years of schooling, levels of educational attainment at specific ages) have long been significantly lower in Italy than in other countries at a comparable level of development. For a long time this did not seem to matter much. In the 1970s and 1980s, Italy’s ‘industrial districts’ (clusters of small, specialised manufacturing firms) prospered largely on the strength of a peculiar, highly localised form of human capital, acquired in vocational schools, through on-the-job training, and through general social interaction (sometimes called the ‘local industrial climate’). In that context, the returns to formal education appeared to be low. Since then, however, the increasing global importance of technology-related skills has radically changed the picture; the ‘industrial climate’, important as it is, is no longer enough. In fact, inadequate human capital development is, I suspect, one of the reasons behind the unsatisfactory productivity growth of the country in the past couple of decades. Favoured by (piecemeal) reforms, some progress is being made along both dimensions of education: average schooling is up, and international comparisons of skills for young cohorts are now less unfavourable than they used to be. However, a gap remains, and in my opinion it receives less systematic public-policy attention than it deserves.22 Increasing flexibility, providing safety nets – Growing empirical evidence shows that greater labour market flexibility, coupled with policies that reduce labour market duality, results in better outcomes. For example, countries that entered the Great Recession with more flexible labour markets have generally shown greater resilience. 20  Flisi, S., Goglio, V., Meroni, E., Rodrigues, M. and Vera-Toscano, E.

The issue is how to balance fast system-wide reallocation with sufficiently comprehensive individual security: while not easy, this balance can in principle be pursued through flexible labour regulation accompanied by an appropriate form of protection for those who lose their jobs, by retraining, and by active labour policies. Four papers will be presented at this conference that deal with these issues: specifically, the effectiveness of short-time work subsidies in saving jobs,23 the relationship between workers’ flows in multi-plant firms and firing restrictions,24 the relevance of advance layoff notices for workers’ reallocation,25 and the effectiveness of active labour market programs.26 In the past few years, many European countries have taken steps to improve the functioning of the labour market.27 The LABREF dataset of the European Commission, which records all reforms in employment protection legislation, lists almost twice as many measures in 2008-2013 as in the previous seven years. In Italy, the number of reforms grew by a factor of seven during those years, while the reform process continued in 2014 and 2015. Reforms extended the coverage of the unemployment benefit system, enhanced active policies, and increased the flexibility of labour market rules, notably by making firing procedures simpler and less uncertain. The French reform of 2017 goes much in the same direction.  Available research has shown that the Italian reforms have contributed to creating new stable jobs after a period of prolonged stagnation, and to accelerating the conversion of temporary into permanent jobs.28 One paper along these lines will be presented tomorrow.29 The path ahead Europe has made considerable, if uneven, progress in improving labour-related regulation in the past few years. Even though the profound scars of the Great Recession are still visible in many countries, employment levels are now higher than they were before the crisis started in 2008; the share of individuals actually participating in the labour market is also at its highest level ever, reflecting both increased dynamism in our societies and the effect of policies that have reduced disincentives to work. Still, much remains to be done. 23  Cahuc, P., Kramarz, F. and Nevoux, S.

Labour markets are excessively segmented between insiders and outsiders. Due to persistent rigidities and to less favourable economic prospects than in the past, younger generations entering the labour market today face worse job prospects, in terms of stability, career profiles, and wages, than those enjoyed by previous generations.  Technological trends might reinforce the dualism between high- and low-skilled workers. Trade protection or a retreat from the technology frontier would be myopic. Increasing and improving general education and supporting (re-)training are, instead, a priority to make growth more inclusive. A difficult balance needs to be struck between cushioning individual workers from the most disruptive effects of change and fostering the active adaptation of the individuals themselves and of society at large. There is ample scope for further research. I have already mentioned some of the papers in this conference that focus on certain key subjects. Let me mention, by way of conclusion, three additional open issues:  • Do we know enough about the actual cost effectiveness of active labour market policies in different institutional frameworks? I have not yet seen much research contrasting the outcomes of such policies with alternative uses of public money, such as a reduction in the tax wedge on labour.  • Do we know enough about what drives the efficiency of the matching process between job-seekers and vacancies? Do we understand the reasons for persistent geographical and skill misalignments? What is the key to designing policies to target structural, long-term unemployment? • Finally, many are puzzled by how little wage cyclicality is normally observed, especially at the aggregate level. Can this be due to composition effects, i.e., to the fact that negative demand shocks usually hit low-skilled or low-tenured workers hardest? What is the impact of nominal wage rigidities, and of job-seekers’ behaviour?  Barbara Petrongolo, who is to deliver the first speech in this conference, will focus precisely on this last point. I do not want to encroach any further on her presentation. It is therefore high time for me to close these remarks – and to wish you all a stimulating and lively discussion. 9

Sabine Lautenschläger: Cyber resilience - objectives and toolsSpeech by Ms Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the European CentralBank and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the European Central Bank, at the first meetingof the Euro Cyber Resilience Board for pan-European Financial Infrastructures, Frankfurt amMain, 9 March 2018.*   *   *In 1903, the Italian inventor Marconi demonstrated his new invention, a wireless telegraph, to alarge audience. It didn’t go too well for him, though. The machine itself did work in the sense thatit transmitted a message. However, it was not the message the audience – or Marconi – hadexpected. The word “rats” was being sent again and again. The system had been hacked. Theculprit in this case was Nevil Maskelyne, a magician. Allegedly, he had been hired by a Britishwired-telegraph company which was worried that Marconi’s invention might ruin its business.Technology has advanced a lot since 1903. And it has created a deeply interconnected world.The financial system is a case in point. No financial institution can survive, let alone thrive, on itsown. No bank can do without the complex web of financial market infrastructures that underpinsits day-to-day business. No bank, therefore, must underestimate the associated risks. Inparticular, no bank must underestimate the IT risks, which include cyber risks. In the worst case,a single hack could compromise the entire system. So cyber resilience is a goal we all share.And anyone who sees it as just another competitive advantage is mistaken; the whole chain isonly as strong as its weakest link. And in that sense, many actors in the financial system areparts of the same chain.ECB Banking Supervision takes cyber resilience very seriously. Naturally, we focus on banksand on the euro area. In doing so, we take into account that banks are not just connected amongthemselves but also with other market participants and infrastructures. This means that oursupervision of IT risks also covers the end-points of payment systems and marketinfrastructures in the banks directly supervised by us. In short, we aim to ensure the availability,confidentiality and integrity of banks’ data and systems.What have we done so far and what are our plans for the future?So far, we have conducted thematic reviews on cyber risk and outsourcing. One result isstating the obvious: there is some concentration in terms of companies to which banksoutsource IT functions. Apart from concrete bank-specific findings, the reviews have helpedus to get a better idea of the risks. And they have made banks more aware of them.We have conducted a stocktake on how IT risks are supervised outside the euro area. Thishelped us to identify best practices; and it will help us to define our own supervisoryexpectations. Work is ongoing as part of our contribution to the work programme of theEuropean Banking Authority, the EBA.We have conducted quite a few on-site inspections into IT and cyber risks, using state-of-the-art methods. Looking ahead, our aim would be to have such inspections every three orfour years for large banks.We have set up a reporting framework for cyber incidents. Since mid-2017, banks havebeen required to report significant cyber incidents. This will help us to quickly react in a crisisand make us aware of common vulnerabilities.Drawing on guidelines from the EBA, we have developed comprehensive IT risk self-assessments for the banks we supervise, including an extensive section on IT and cybersecurity. The results of these assessments will feed into our Supervisory Review and EvaluationProcess, in which we will also challenge the information provided by banks. We will do so as aresult of our insights from on-site inspections and from reports of cyber incidents. The 1 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
information collected will then serve as a basis for a thematic review of IT risks. This review willgive us a better idea of the overall IT risk landscape in the banking industry. It will allow us toidentify blind spots early on and define areas which we need to investigate further; this willeventually feed into our plans for 2019. In addition, the review will also help us to compare banks.Partially anonymised feedback could then be shared with them.Ladies and gentlemen, there is one thing we need to keep in mind. Right from the start, hacksgained a lot of attention, while preventing them did not. In finance, as in many other fields, it ismostly just mundane work that helps to keep things safe. I wonder whether cyber risk is asunique as we are inclined to believe. I have no doubt that we need to take it seriously and that weneed to work towards making banks more resilient. In doing so, we should also welcome newways of tackling cyber risk, of course. But this I would like to do within the existing framework ofbanks’ risk management. Cyber risk needs to be part of general risk management procedures, ofgeneral crisis management, and general business continuity planning. After all, it is anoperational risk. And our experience in dealing with operational risks can help us to cope withcyber risk as well.We must keep in mind that cyber risk does not invariably arise from the technology itself but alsofrom how we use it. It is people who are behind the hacking. And often, it is people who leavedoors unlocked and gates wide open for cyber criminals to sneak in. People play a big role whenit comes to cyber resilience. Thus, it makes sense to draw on the principles we have establishedfor risk management and governance, and on the experience we have gained in these areas.Ladies and gentlemen, I am aware that this kind of work is unlikely to capture the public’sattention in the same way as Mr Maskelyne did in 1903. But it needs to be done. Whilecybercrime may have an aura of mystery and power, cyber resilience is quite the opposite: itcalls for vigilance and diligence, day in, day out.Thank you. 2 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
Yves Mersch: Interview in Luxemburger WortInterview with Mr Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, inLuxemburger Wort, conducted by Mr Pierre Sorlut and Ms Barbara Tasch on 8 March andpublished on 14 March 2018.*   *   *Mr Mersch, the Governing Council has not yet decided to raise the interest rate. Whenthat happens, the debt-to-service ratio will increase and put pressure on householdswho took out loans to buy their houses. How big is the danger?Let me say first that the bigger the imbalances, the less the economy is prepared for a monetarypolicy change. Any change in the monetary policy stance is always a shock to the economy,positive or negative.It’s not in our mandate to consider the households of any particular country when we change themonetary policy stance. That includes Luxembourg. We set interest rates for the euro area as awhole. We are not yet ready at this stage to change interest rates. We first take the non-conventional measures towards the exit. Only then will we consider the conventional ones.Today, at our press conference, we confirmed that we’re confident with the path which is leadingto our objective. The primary objective is price stability, which we have defined as an inflation rateof below, but close to, 2% in the medium term.Second, on some banks’ balance sheets, loans to the private sector are very substantial and insome there is a high concentration of mortgages. In Luxembourg there are one or two institutionsthat rank among those with the highest exposure to mortgages in Europe. If a shock affects thiscluster of assets, then they are at risk. Household indebtedness in Luxembourg is higher than inother countries – however the wealth of these households is also higher than in other countries,and disparities between the holders of assets and liabilities also have to be considered. What isspecific to Luxembourg is that the price pressure on the housing market is growing faster than inmany other countries. We’re speaking of a 7% increase while the economy is growing at onlyhalf that rate. We’re speaking of a more than 50% increase in house prices over the last eight ornine years. This is mostly explained by the insufficient supply and by the strong demand resultingfrom labour inflows. This also results in wealth per capita in Luxembourg not growing. In turn, thatcreates the impression that wealth is not being fairly distributed. To sum up, Luxembourg is notrunning into a wall but risks are clearly there and actions have to be taken, as recommended byinternational and domestic institutions.What actions?That’s up to the national authorities. It’s not a matter of monetary policy. Monetary policy is a bluntweapon. But those best equipped to deal with the situation are the national authorities, as theyare the closest. This is why macroprudential policy, as it is called, is in the hands of the nationalauthorities.What would be the room for manoeuvre?There are tools which are aimed at the borrower or the lender. You have debt-to-income ratios,loan-to-value ratios, etc. There are also tax measures. If, on the one hand, you support lending byreducing taxation, it makes no sense to tighten lending with macroprudential tools on the other.One has to be consistent.Being consistent is the first rule of governance. If monetary policy is loose, as it is now, and ontop you also have loose fiscal policy, and on the supervisory side you deregulate or have very laxsupervision, then you’re asking for trouble. That’s exactly what caused the last financial crisis: 1 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
the combination of loose fiscal policy, accommodative monetary policy and lax supervision.How exactly does the ECB assess the risk of Brexit?First, we need to know what the UK is requesting. Second, we need to know what is happeningduring the transition period – if there is one. If there is no deal and there is a hard Brexit, this willharm both sides. There will be a need for some legal clarity. For instance, will contracts still bevalid and, if so, how could they be implemented? The private sector solutions could be extremelydifficult and cumbersome. But there could also be a need for a public sector response, e.g.some recognition or grandfathering of existing contracts. When do you start this grandfathering?At the moment they declare Brexit or at the moment you start the transition? This is all unclear. Ican’t give you all the answers, but neither am I one of those who believe that the EU will go underwithout London.How would you define your cooperation with the Luxembourg regulator?I consider that the central bank side is working better because it is constructed differently. Weare a Eurosystem, while supervision is not. For the supervisors there are still a lot of nationalregulations to respect. If a supranational body like the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) wereto use only European law, things would be clear. That would be our preference. But insupervision sometimes national law prevails and there is still a lot of divergence between nationallaws that the single supervisor has to respect.How would you centralise the whole thing?Different agencies exist, such as the European Banking Authority (EBA), the European Securitiesand Markets Authority (ESMA) and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority(EIOPA). But they only have what is essentially a coordination role at the moment. The SingleSupervisory Mechanism (SSM) at the ECB has the effective supervisory function for banking. Forall the agencies, there are proposals for improvement on the table. For securities markets,another important piece of draft regulation is the European Market Infrastructure Regulation 2(EMIR2). If we have to contact 25 different regulators or supervisors in order to get a picture ofwho and what in the single market is allowed and under what conditions, it would be extremelycumbersome. From that point of view, we welcome an increase in efficiency at European level.We consider the completion of the banking union important for the single market and the singlecurrency, in other words, one market, one banking supervisor and one security supervisor in themedium term. That should be accompanied by one deposit insurance system as well. But Iunderstand those who say, “Let’s first clean up all the remaining negative elements from the pastbefore we accept a sharing of responsibility at European level. That is exactly what we are doingnow by pushing for the resolution of non-performing loans. We’re trying to put supervisorystandards on the same level. It is not enough to assign only the responsibility to the Europeanlevel, we also need a level playing field in terms of the tools and their implementation.The Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF) has recently expressedits concern about its sanctioning powers. What do you think of Director General ClaudeMarx’s statement?I don’t know this statement. According to European law, the authority for criminal cases is still anational affair. When it comes to administrative sanctioning, that’s another issue. Some proposesetting up a sanctioning authority that does nothing but sanctioning. I don’t know, and I do nothave to know, national initiatives in a national context in this respect. On the central bank side wehave sanctions at national but also at European level.You’re referring to the case of the Latvian bank ABLV...The Latvian subsidiary. I read in the media that the supervisory side of the ECB informed the1 2 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
national authorities of what happened and suggested to them to use the tools they have at theirdisposal. Since the way the national tools were used is now the subject of a court case, I cannotcomment further on it. Let the court decide. The national central bank for its part took its ownmeasures. And they suspended the bank. The ECB did not suspend the whole group [frommonetary policy operations] until later. The Banque centrale du Luxembourg (BCL) suspendedthe group before the ECB because they have the possibility to do so at national level.Would you have another example?There are some investment funds which ought to provide information and statistics to thenational central bank, which then reports to us. But some funds don’t do it. We have asked theBCL several times to initiate sanctions because we consider that the local authority has clearknowledge of the matter. I think they are now ready to do it. I would not say centralisation is betterper se. Sometimes proximity leads to higher efficiency.Another topic which is concerning the ECB and national lawmakers is virtual currencies.Luxembourg and other countries in the EU are granting more and more importance tovirtual currencies, but you seem to be really cautious. What do you see as the biggestpotential threats emanating from cryptocurrencies?One should consider various aspects. One is financial stability, the second is consumerprotection, the third is investor protection, the fourth is market integrity and the fifth is anti-moneylaundering. Concerns regarding these aspects are especially high in relation to what you callcryptocurrencies. I call them virtual tokens, by the way. They are like the tokens you buy whenyou go to a casino. Studies have shown that 50% of transactions made using these virtualtokens and 25% of users are linked to illicit activities. There are four main risks. The first risk ismarket liquidity. The market is excessively concentrated, with about 96% of transactions beingcarried out by 2% of account holders. Second is liquidity risk. These currencies still always needtransferring to the real economy because your bakery will not accept them. There wereconferences on bitcoins where they said you could pay with bitcoin. But when you tried to pay theentrance fee with bitcoin, it took so long that the conference was over by the time the paymentwas received. It is not an efficient system.The third risk is that people use cryptocurrencies to create leverage because they don’t getleverage any more in the real economy. For example, consumers could use their credit cards tomake such investments and increase their indebtedness. The higher the leverage, the greaterthe risk as well.The fourth risk is the operational and technical immaturity of the technology. We are open to thetechnology of distributed ledgers. But that is something different from bitcoin. Bitcoin itselfbelongs to no one; no one is backing it, no one is issuing it. The mining is happening to a largeextent in remote places and involves very high energy consumption. Bitcoin’s estimated annualenergy consumption has now reached more than 52 terawatt hours per year, which is more thanthe total energy consumption of Portugal. We see that, for example, when approval is sought, itsometimes takes several hours to get one block validated. The ECB, by contrast, is about tooffer instant payments in all European countries. An instant payment costs 0.2 cent and therecipient has it within 10 seconds. This is efficient and pan-European, and it is also operated bytrusted authorities as well as regulated and supervised entities.Then you have contagion channels for the risks of virtual currencies. If households are heavilyinvolved in bitcoin and the whole thing collapses, it could create a wealth effect on the economy,depending of course on the scale of the market. With official currencies, you have central banks,like the ECB, you have governments who put political capital into maintaining a currency andsupporting it. But if people do not distinguish between the two things – and this is why I don’t likethe word “currency” for these schemes – it would undermine confidence in the official currency. 3 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
And some of those who promote these new schemes want a currency which is not controlled bya government. So it’s a slightly sympathetic anarchic or libertarian approach, but unfortunatelythere is no libertarian law enforcement and there is no libertarian world government.You said in London last month that virtual currencies were not real money and that theywouldn’t be for the foreseeable future. So what would have to change for them to beconsidered money, what would need to be implemented?Without a trusted authority backing the stability of a so-called currency, an institution whoseprimary objective is to do just that, you don’t have a currency. A currency has three functions: aunit of account, a store of value and a medium of exchange. These tokens don’t fulfil any of thethree functions, as I said in London.There is another sector growing without proper authority, and that’s shadow banking. Arecent study has shown that it’s growing, and that the Luxembourg market – which is forthe first time included in the study – could represent 7.2% of all shadow banking. Howwould you judge whether activities like securitisation represent a threat to financialstability?Let me first say that you cannot call everything that is not a bank a shadow bank. Banking bydefinition means that you give credit and you take deposits. Indeed, many of these institutionsdon’t do that. But on the other hand it is certainly true that some vehicles have been created toremove risk from banks and thus reduce their regulatory capital requirements, with such vehiclesbeing used in order to escape supervision. That is what we cannot accept any more. We cannotafford another crisis of the magnitude we had.How would you manage that risk?We need to be determined and implement the rules that were agreed at the Pittsburgh G20summit. But not everything is shadow banking. For example, the World Bank – and above all itssister organisation the International Finance Corporation (IFC) – is doing a lot of financing throughLuxembourg. All the international development banks are issuing through Luxembourg becauseof its efficient legislation. Many corporations which operate worldwide cannot raise funds in eachcountry; it’s more efficient to bundle them. I would say that this is efficient international finance,not shadow banking, and it does not create additional risk for the customer but rather lowers thecost of funding.Another topic for discussion is money market funds, which to some extent can have leverageand so are much closer to being like a bank. And that is also the reason why money marketfunds are obliged to report to the ECB. Then you have investment funds from entities likeinvestment banks, private equity and other alternative investment funds (AIFs). Don’t forget thatLehman Brothers was not a bank in Luxembourg, but they sold their products to most banks atthat time. So these are areas where we have to see whether what’s involved is not in fact a bank-like activity. And if it is, then it should also be subject to the same regulations as a bank, becauseotherwise we don’t have a level playing field. The objective is to de-risk the financial world andprevent the kind of risk accumulation that led to the crisis. We should regulate risk rather thanentities according to their legal definition.How much of a risk are the Italian election results to financial stability in Europe?Italy is the third largest economy in the euro area. Italy has shown a certain amount of institutionalresilience in the past, and of course the elections have been a lesson to the established parties. Ihope that resilience will come into play in the coming weeks and months.And then on the other side of the Atlantic, President Trump has just announced an 4 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
increase in tariffs on steel and aluminium, which could start a trade conflict with Europe.How much does the ECB worry about that?Obviously, conflicts are not conducive to economic growth, but let’s take things step by step. Asthe President of the ECB said at our recent press conference, they can affect the confidencechannel. This is because confidence is so important, even at this stage of the economy’sexpansion.Some forecasts have shown a slight slowdown in growth in the euro area. How couldthat become a problem for the inflation target?Less than six months ago, some said that inflation would be below 1% in February or March, andgrowth forecasts were less than half of what they are now. All the indicators point to economicgrowth in Europe continuing, because, for example, both capacity utilisation and labour utilisationpoint to a continued need for further investment and capacity extension. Supply-side expansion isincreasing potential growth and allowing for more labour utilisation and higher incomes.To conclude on a more personal note, what are your plans for December 2020?I couldn’t even tell you where I will be spending Christmas 2020, and I have not given it anythought. Indeed, I still enjoy my work. But the older you get, the more you are unable to makeplans which are 50 years ahead.The Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier is the supervisory authority of the Luxembourg financialsector.1 5 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
Stephen S Poloz: Central Bank of the Year AwardRemarks by Mr Stephen S Poloz, Governor of the Bank of Canada, at the Central BankingAwards 2018, London, 1 March 2018.*   *   *It is an honour for me to accept the award for Central Bank of the Year on behalf of the staff ofthe Bank of Canada. And it is a real pleasure to be here to celebrate the successes andachievements of central bankers from around the globe, such as my good friend LesetjaKganyago of South Africa.Back in January, when Central Banking announced this award, you published an extensive write-up that detailed the reasons why we were judged to be worthy of it. I am very glad that you did so,because the article illustrates just how important teamwork is at the Bank of Canada. In thatarticle, every employee in every department can see how their own work contributes to a centralbank that is operating at the top of its game. From the model developers, to the currencydesigners, to the people who got us settled back in our renewed headquarters—everyonecontributed to an outstanding body of work with remarkable skill and dedication. So, this awardbelongs to all the members of our incredible team.I would like to particularly thank Central Banking for recognizing the work we have done in termsof conducting monetary policy in an era of heightened uncertainty. We have been working on thetheme of uncertainty since the global financial crisis revealed the limits of our models and ourknowledge. And we have learned that it is far better to be open and honest about the uncertaintywe face, as well as how we deal with it, rather than to just assume the uncertainty away andproject a false sense of confidence.Because profound uncertainties are everywhere, we began talking about monetary policy as anexercise in risk management, as opposed to the precision engineering that many believe thepractice of monetary policy to be. To be truly honest about the uncertainties we face, we stoppedproviding routine forward guidance, which observers and market participants had come to relyon. We took some grief for this decision. But I am certain that the best and most honestapproach is to communicate openly about the Bank’s reaction function, and the key risks wesee.  This leaves market participants to interpret the data and make their own forecasts aboutthe future path of interest rates. It has taken time, but markets and observers are increasinglyadapting to our approach.This experience shows that open communications are vitally important—even more so in a worldwhere public institutions are increasingly viewed with suspicion and distrust. We embracetransparency—as you recognized last year—and embed communications in all our plans at thestart of the planning process, rather than tacking them on as an afterthought at the end. Thisapproach led us to take on some of the projects that you have highlighted. We hosted aconference on the most fundamental questions about our monetary policy framework, andbroadcast it on the web. We encouraged unprecedented public engagement in our bank notedesign. And we gave our researchers freedom to publish their best and most interesting workwithout worrying about whether it follows Bank orthodoxy.So, let me just conclude by again thanking Central Banking for this recognition. It means a lot toeveryone at the Bank of Canada. I know I would not be here without the hard work of everyone onour team. The best employees in the world are the ones who made it all happen, and I’m gratefulto them all.Thank you. 1 / 1BIS central bankers' speeches
Mr Nestor A Espenilla, Jr: Private cryptocurrencies and lessonsfrom a red paperclipSpeech by Mr Nestor A Espenilla, Jr, Governor of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP, the centralbank of the Philippines), at the Shareholders’ Association of the Philippines (SharePHIL) GeneralMembership Meeting and Cryptocurrency "The Truth & The Myth Forum", Makati City, 12 March2018.*   *   *Officers and members of the Shareholders’ Association of the Philippines, guests from the publicand private sectors, ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon! It is my pleasure to share the Bangko Sentral’s insights and initiatives on privately-issuedcryptocurrencies.  I am hopeful that in doing so, we will, as your theme suggests, be able to cutthrough the “truths and myths” surrounding this fairly novel medium of exchange.  Notice thoughthat I make a key distinction as there’s such a thing as central bank-issued digital currency.  I’mnot going there today as that’s a different conversation all together even as the underlyingtechnology may be similar.But there it is. Cryptocurrencies are a medium of exchange. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas(BSP) recognizes this.  We have defined crypto or virtual currency as any “form of digitally storedvalue created by an agreement within the community of virtual currency users.”   As far back as2014, the BSP advised the public of the features, benefits and attendant risks in dealing withcryptocurrency. We have adopted a regulatory approach to privately-issued cryptocurrency that is balanced,open and flexible. This is to allow the market to promote financial innovation and for the industryto take advantage of all its benefits and efficiencies – with prudence. We have issued (and will be ready to issue more) responsive regulations. Last February 2017,we issued Circular No. 944. We now require businesses engaged in the exchange of privately-issued cryptocurrency for equivalent fiat money, to register with the BSP as remittance andtransfer companies. Moreover, we strongly cautioned the public against unscrupulous individualsor groups who offer virtual currency pyramid schemes disguised as initial coin offerings orinvestment products. The advisory likewise provided tips on securing virtual currency accounts (Ithink this thrust is something SharePHIL would appreciate given its mission with respect toconsumer education and protecting investors’ rights.) To be clear, we do not endorse privately-issued cryptocurrencies as a medium ofexchange. Moreover, given their highly speculative and volatile nature, we do not endorse themas investment vehicles either. Rather, our objective as a central bank is to address any risks that they may pose to the publiceven as they exist as a fact of life.  This is consistent with our goal of increasing consumerprotection.  It is also in keeping with our advocacy against money laundering, terrorist financingand other crimes  (As you know, given cryptocurrency’s reliance on the full anonymity of thosewho transact in them, there is a propensity for this mode of payment to be used for illegalpurposes).In keeping with our mandate to promote financial stability, we also aim to address any risksposed by cryptocurrency to the financial system.These risks are not imagined. They arise ascryptocurrency necessarily interplays with the non-digital world – the regular economy – whenthey are exchanged into pesos or other traditional currency.It is important to note that privately-issued cryptocurrency is not legal tender.  Unlike fiat money, 1 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
such cryptocurrencies are not backed or guaranteed by any central monetary authority.  Only theBSP has the sole power and authority to issue currency within the Philippines.  Under the law, noother person or entity, public or private, may put into circulation, notes, coins or any other objector document which might circulate as currency.  Our notes and coins are fully guaranteed by theGovernment and are legal tender in the Philippines for all public and private debts.While privately-issued cryptocurrencies do not enjoy legal tender status, they are, however, as amatter of practice, used as a medium of exchange and a store of value.  But aren’t so manyother things? The red paperclip storyThis brings to mind a story about a red paperclip that went viral. Some of you may be familiarwith it. In 2005, a Canadian blogger – Kyle MacDonald began a series of transactions which heposted on-line.  He began with a red paperclip as a medium of exchange.  He exchanged this foran interesting looking fish-shaped pen, which he traded for an odd-looking doorknob…then acamp stove…so on and so forth.  By his thirteenth barter – in a little over a year —  MacDonaldwas in possession of a movie role (a chance to act in a movie), which was finally traded for atwo-story farmhouse in a small Canadian town!  And it all started with a red paperclip!  (It’s aninteresting story.  You can google it!)This red paperclip story has uncomplicated elements that differ starkly from cryptocurrency’shigh-tech world of blockchains, miners and cryptography.  I introduce it not just to keep yourattention or to refresh you with its simplicity but because there are powerful and commonlessons to be learned from it and from the phenomenon of cryptocurrencies.These are:   First, additional participants in a transaction exponentially increase value which isdefined, measured and transferred through consent.  Second, there is power in leveraging ondigital technology as a connector of people.  Finally, people always count.  Using these points, allow me to share not only more insights on cryptocurrency, but also someinitiatives in the BSP’s exciting financial reform agenda – initiatives which  (unlikecryptocurrencies)  we fully endorse.Exponential increase in value through wide consentThe first lesson from both the red paperclip story and the phenomenal use of privately-issuedcryptocurrencies is that additional participants in a transaction exponentially increase value.  Thisvalue is defined, measured and transferred through consent.The success of the red paperclip project comes from the fact that its transactors defined anddetermined what they deemed to be valuable. On the other hand, while privately-issuedcryptocurrencies are fast gaining global popularity, we deem their acceptance as still limited. We believe privately-issued cryptocurrencies cannot completely fulfill the roles of money as astore of value and as an independent unit of account.  Until such time that such cryptocurrenciesare able to fully demonstrate stability, the prospect that they will replace today’s fiat currenciesappears to be far-off.  They are simply still too volatile.Power of technology to connect peopleThe second lesson is that there is power in leveraging on digital technology as a connector ofpeople. In the red paperclip story, it cannot be denied that the values that were traded were notjust in the objects themselves (They were, especially in the beginning, only ordinary objects andmight even be considered junk by many). 2 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
Rather, the psychic value came from the opportunity to be on-line personalities, from viralexposure as all trades were posted on MacDonald’s blog that had gained quite a following.  Aswith cryptocurrencies, the great socio-experiment could also not have been possible withoutdynamic computer-to-computer connections.In this regard, the BSP acknowledges the huge potential of digital technology, that includescryptocurrencies, to transform financial service delivery, specifically in the area of payments andremittance. High-speed digital networks allow funds to move across the globe at a much faster,cheaper and convenient way compared to traditional models. Their use is game-changing for theunbanked, given their affordability and wider reach. As far as the BSP is concerned, this is worth looking into as it is consistent with its financialinclusion advocacy.  For this reason, we continue to closely engage with various stakeholders,including fintech players, to better understand varying business models, processes andsystems.   Our priority is to develop a digital financial ecosystem that supports the diverse needs of all usersin a manner that is secure, sustainable, convenient and affordable. For the service providers –whether new or incumbent, this ecosystem enables them to tap into a wider client base, diversifyrevenue sources and secure new growth opportunities. To us, this line of pursuing financialinclusion is more in keeping with our financial stability objectives. The pillars of such an ecosystem that leverages on technology would include: an efficient retailpayment system that facilitates delivery of digital products, especially for small value transactors;an expansive network of low cost touch points to on-board new clients and facilitate the digitizingand disbursing of cash and other financial transactions; and democratized access to atransaction account, wherein every person – regardless of economic and social stature – is ableto open an account and use digital finance products.  Overall, this inclusive digital finance ecosystem will support the diverse needs of all users in asafe, convenient and affordable manner. It would have the right mix and range of serviceproviders (banks and non-banks alike) and digital platforms to facilitate the sustainable delivery offit-for-purpose and affordable financial services, especially designed for the low income market. People always countThe final lesson in all this is that, “people always count.”  This is what drives us in the BSP as wepursue game changing financial reforms to deepen financial markets, foster financial inclusion,increase consumer protection and to basically improve the quality of life of all Filipinos.  That being said, I must say that this new frontier of cryptocurrency brings up legitimate concernsthat affect people… that affect the public.  These issues are being looked into by the BSP andother financial regulators globally. One issue is private cryptocurrency as an investment option.  Its value is volatile for starters. Thus, we earnestly caution the public that before speculating or investing their hard-earnedmoney in cryptocurrencies — as with any other type of investment — prospective investorsshould first know and fully understand the risks involved.Because people matter, we at the BSP, like SharePHIL, value investor education. We have(together with the Department of Finance, Securities and Exchange Commission, InsuranceCommission and the Anti-Money Laundering Council) made plans to embark on a nationwidepublic information campaign on cryptocurrency.  The purpose is to inform and educate the publicon what cryptocurrencies are, their uses and risks, related policies and regulations in thePhilippines, and possible pitfalls. 3 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
Another serious concern is cryptocurrencies’ attractiveness to, and use by, money launderersand terrorist financiers. This attractiveness stems from the anonymous and encrypted identitiesof transactors in private cryptocurrency.  It is this very anonymity that cryptocurrency users valuemost.  It enables them to transact in the so-called “dark web.”Allow us at the BSP to offer a contrary idea:  There is power in identification. We believe that tosignificantly catalyze a digital ecosystem, there must be a reliable national digital identificationsystem. This system will address persistent customer on-boarding issues due to lack ofacceptable IDs and the highly inefficient paper-based KYC processes which make serving smallvalue transactors unattractive. The BSP therefore strongly supports the passage of the Philippine ID System bill which wasidentified by the Legislative Executive Development Council (LEDAC) in its August 2017 meetingas an urgent measure. The Lower House has already approved its version on third reading.  Atthe Senate, its version is  tentatively scheduled for sponsorship today, Monday, March 12 evenas we speak. Truly exciting!The envisioned national ID system will be designed to ensure universal coverage, data integrityand security, and optimum utility.  It will serve as an enabling platform for the efficient delivery of awhole range of government and private sector services for all Filipinos – especially the currentlyunserved.  Establishing a readily- verifiable digital identity will enable our people to open accountsand use financial services more efficiently.Closing thoughtsThis message obviously comes from a Central Bank Governor wary of currencies that do notqualify as legal tender and which are not backed by any monetary authority. But it is a message that comes too from a Central Bank Governor who has been labelled as a“disruptor” – one that leads an institution that is ready to embrace the challenges of a rapidlychanging financial and economic landscape. This message is shared with this audience, a staunch advocate of investor rights and investors’need for information.  It is a good match. As I close, to align this message better with your theme… let me summarize the truths andmyths of cryptocurrency from the BSP’s viewpoint:Myth:  Privately-issued cryptocurrencies are legal tender and shall soon replace fiatcurrency.  Truth: Cryptocurrencies, not backed by any central authority are not legal tender. Moreover, until they fully demonstrate stability, wide acceptability and other economic attributes,they will not replace fiat currency any time soon.Myth: Cryptocurrencies are bad and are only used for illicit activities.  Truth: Cryptocurrencies,like fiat currencies, are neither good nor bad.  They are neutral. But, no doubt, BSP is mindful oftheir wide use in illicit activities because of the anonymity of its transactors and is taking action inthis regard.Myth: The BSP endorses the use of and/or investment in privately-issuedcryptocurrencies.  Truth: The BSP allows the market to develop but it has also issuedresponsive regulations to uphold consumer protection and to maintain financial stability. The BSPdoes not endorse or promote privately-issued cryptocurrencies but aims to address its risks as itintersects with the financial system.Rest assured, the BSP maintains a forward-looking approach to ensure that regulatory andsupervisory frameworks are in tune with emerging trends and developments.  Through constant 4 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
surveillance and monitoring of the market environment, the BSP stands ready to adapt to futurechallenges and opportunities ahead.I hope I have delivered on the terms of reference for this forum.  You have been a wonderfulaudience.  Thank you for your attention.Maraming salamat sa inyong lahat. 5 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
Benoît Cœuré: A Euro Cyber Resilience Board for pan-EuropeanFinancial InfrastructuresIntroductory remarks by Mr Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the EuropeanCentral Bank, at the first meeting of the Euro Cyber Resilience Board for pan-European FinancialInfrastructures, Frankfurt am Main, 9 March 2018.*   *   *It is a pleasure to welcome you back to Frankfurt. Our last meeting was in June last year. Today,we will discuss the future course of the high-level cyber resilience forum for pan-Europeanfinancial market infrastructures, critical service providers and competent authorities.Establishment of the Euro Cyber Resilience Board for pan-European FinancialInfrastructuresRecent technological advances have enabled cybercriminals to conduct ever moresophisticated, precise and powerful attacks. And nobody is immune to cyber risks, includingbusinesses, financial infrastructures and public administrations. So we should avoid a “blameand shame” culture and work together.The ECB and the Eurosystem are striving to lead by example. At the ECB, overseers, operators,supervisors and IT security services are working together more closely on cyber issues. Withinthe Eurosystem, there has been close collaboration on implementing the Eurosystem oversightcyber resilience strategy for financial market infrastructures that we presented at our lastmeeting, in line with CPMI-IOSCO’s guidance on this topic. The Market Infrastructure Board,which is in charge of Eurosystem financial market infrastructures, has also scaled up itsactivities to ensure the continued cyber resilience of its systems and platforms.Eurosystem initiatives are part of a growing international effort to combat cyber threats. TheCPMI-IOSCO guidance is being implemented. In October 2017, the Financial Stability Board(FSB) delivered a stocktake report of relevant regulations and supervisory practices to G20finance ministers and governors, and G7 ministers and governors published the “FundamentalElements for Effective Assessment of Cybersecurity in the Financial Sector”. The FSB willproduce a common lexicon of important terms, while the G7 Cyber Expert Group continues towork on third-party risks, cross-sector coordination and threat-led penetration testing, and willmake proposals for G7 cross-border cyber crisis simulation exercises.In this context, the Eurosystem aims at coordinating its own activities in the field of cyber riskswith that of market participants and other public authorities to succeed in protecting the financialsystem from cyber threats. I therefore invite you today to become part of the Euro CyberResilience Board (ECRB) for pan-European Financial Infrastructures – a regular forum where wecan work together in a trusted environment.The ECRB’s objective is to enhance the cyber resilience of financial market infrastructures andtheir critical service providers, as well as that of the wider EU financial sector, in line withinternational standards. This will be achieved by fostering trust and collaboration and facilitatingjoint initiatives – whether among market players or between market players and authorities. TheECRB will thus contribute to the overall stability of the EU financial system.The ECRB will have no formal powers to impose binding measures and will not makesupervisory judgements. Its legitimacy will stem from the voluntary commitment of its membersto abide by its common positions, statements and strategic views.The ECRB will be chaired by the ECB, which will be closely involved together with national12 1 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
central banks and observers from the relevant European public authorities. This will ensure thatthe ECRB acts in the interest of Europe as a whole. Its common positions, statements andstrategic views will be adopted by consensus.To kick off the work of the ECRB, we would like to reflect with you on possible work items whichwe could address collectively. As part of this, we will also report on two of our most recentactivities.First, a cyber resilience survey, developed under the Eurosystem oversight cyber resiliencestrategy, was conducted across more than 75 payment systems, central securities depositoriesand central counterparties throughout Europe. As you will see, the survey highlighted a numberof very pertinent issues for discussion, such as cyber governance, training and awareness, andcyber incident response.Second, the Eurosystem is currently finalising the main elements of the European ThreatIntelligence-Based Ethical Red-Teaming (TIBER-EU) Framework. This is an interesting conceptwhich we hope will raise the level of cyber resilience in Europe and enable cross-border, cross-authority testing, which has not been done before.We look forward to hearing your feedback on these two initiatives. We will also update you on theforthcoming market-wide exercise, which will explore the challenges of a specific cyber scenarioand see how we can work closer together in times of crisis.I am confident that we will have a fruitful discussion. I will now hand over to my colleague SabineLautenschläger, who will make some introductory remarks from the supervisory perspective.After that, I would like to invite the European Commission representative to briefly introduce thevery recently published “FinTech Action plan”, which presents some interesting points to beconsidered with regard to the cyber resilience of the financial sector.Thank you.Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures and International Organization of Securities Commissions(CPMI-IOSCO) Guidance on cyber resilience for financial market infrastructures, availableat: www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD535.pdf Available at: www.mef.gov.it/inevidenza/documenti/PRA_BCV_4728453_v_1_G7_Fundamental.pdf12 2 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
Yannis Stournaras: The future of moneySpeech by Mr Yannis Stournaras, Governor of the Bank of Greece, at the InternationalConference &quot;The Future of Money: Trend-Alternatives-Potentials&quot;, The AmericanSchool of Classical Studies (Gennadius Library), Athens, 24 May 2018.*   *   *Ladies and Gentlemen,Thank you very much for the kind invitation to this event. I am very happy to be here today andaddress such a distinguished audience.Most people assume that all issues pertaining to “money” are an easy task for a Central BankGovernor. On the contrary. Some issues are very challenging, including present emergingtechnologies in the field of finance and mushrooming cryptocurrencies. Addressing such issuespresents a great opportunity for all interested to revisit the fundamental concepts surroundingmoney and how best to shape the monetary space in the future.More than 20 years ago Bill Gates stated: “Banking is essential, banks are not”. Please, allow meto disagree. Banks are of utmost importance, but what is true about this quote is that the distrustthat emerged towards some banking systems after the 2008-2009 global financial crisis and thedevelopment of a society-wide taste for decentralized, peer-to-peer, facebook-type, interactionsacross powerful computer networks, has dramatically altered the landscape in the financialservices. And central banking in the age of digitalization is an interesting issue for reflection in therealm of monetary economics.In my speech I will try to explore some key issues in how money evolves, what is the keyinnovation in private digital currencies, what would a central bank digital currency be like andwhat might be the impact of introducing one for the central bank monetary policy.***“Monetary space”To assess the possible paths that means of payment, and consequently monetary policy, maytake in the coming decades, discussions often focus on the definition of money, its functions andforms.So what is money?A simple answer would probably involve Adam Smith’s example of “the butcher, the brewer andthe baker”, where money is a solution that arose to address the inefficiencies of the bartereconomy. Money is quite simply an asset that everyone wants. The Greek word for money,“chríma”, means something that one uses or needs. So money as a means of payment must beefficient and safe to use.Money, as we know it today, is the result of a long process. The world’s first coins wereproduced in Lydia over 2500 years ago. They were made from electrum, an alloy, and a roaringlion head was engraved on one side, a symbol of the ruling dynasty. This innovation quicklyspread to the city-states of ancient Greece. During the classical period, Greek coinage reachedan exceptional technical and artistic level. As anyone who has visited the Numismatic Collectionat the Bank of Greece knows that money has evolved to meet society’s needs. As economicactivity increased, it became apparent that money supply needed to expand beyond the limits ofholding precious metals. Centuries later, with the circulation of paper money, minting of metal 1 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
coins was restricted to lower values.In classical economic theory, money fulfils three functions. First, it is a means of payment andtherefore has a key role in all financial transactions. Second, it forms a unit of account. Third, it isa store of value. People will only accept money as a means of payment if they believe it can beused again in the future. For all these to work, money assumes a broad trust in the issuinginstitution. The first central bank was founded to build additional trust in the currency, since theissuance by private entities led to an unstable system. Hence, the role of the central bank isrelated to trust.There are three types of money in the economy: a) physical cash, i.e. banknotes and coins.Banknotes is the form of central bank money that can be held by the general public. b) Thesecond is electronically recorded deposit account liabilities on the ledgers of commercial banks.c) The third is reserves, that is, deposits of commercial banks with the central bank.Cash nowadays is displaced in many ways and the “demonetization” of transactions hasbecome a commonplace. However, the question arises: Will there be an increased need forcash in the near future? The answer is clearly positive. For, here is the paradox of the coming“cashless economy”. According to the ECB, in 2016 around 79% of all payments at Points ofSale (PoS) in Europe were made with cash. Therefore, although nowadays most money hasbeen already digitized, cash is still world’s quintessential means of payment. Cash still remainsan important and a very popular component of money supply.Digital CurrenciesPreserving the two distinguishing attributes of cash, namely anonymity and peer-to-peerexchangeability within a digitized platform, had proven to be significantly challenging until thedistributed ledger technology offered in 2008 the key to assure in a decentralized way than onecould never spend twice her withholding (the “double spending problem”).There is a lot of excitement in the air about cryptocurrencies. Everyone has heard about Bitcoin,whose market capitalization as of the first quarter of 2018 exceeded 110 billion US$, increasingby a factor of ten within a year. The above observation raises many questions, while it is true thatcryptocurrencies represent only a negligible fraction of all world payments.There has been a raging debate about the effects on the financial system of introducing virtualcurrencies, digital currencies and related innovations. The IMF has recently recognized thatdigital currencies might offer potential benefits, including greater speed and efficiency in makingpayments and transfers – particularly across borders. Offsetting the promised benefit of lowpayment processing costs, which is expected when the technology in this field matures, is theextreme volatility of cryptocurrencies’ prices. “Crypto” means anonymity and anonymity can beabused in a world of crime, terrorism and evasion.The ECB has been considering monetary policy implications resulting from the introduction ofcryptocurrencies since at least 2012. In its recent study, it suggested that due to its high pricevolatility and low acceptance rate, the bitcoin could not be regarded as a full form of money froman economic perspective. More recently, the issue has been discussed in the G-20 meeting andin the latest communiqué of Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors (Buenos Aires 19-20March 2018) where it was stated that crypto-assets lack the key attributes of sovereigncurrencies, although at some point they could have financial stability implications.So, in the current state, digital currencies leave monetary transmission mechanisms largelyunaffected.123 2 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
However, it is almost a cliché to say that the only certainty about the future of cryptocurrencies isuncertainty. Risks to financial stability may eventually emerge since the impact of the digitalcurrencies on the monetary transmission mechanism ultimately depends on whether firms andhouseholds broadly accept them. Therefore, supervisory authorities are monitoring alldevelopments in the crypto-ecosystem, occasionally issuing warnings for crypto-exchanges andbrokers, Initial Coin Offerings, futures, exchanged traded funds etc. To this date, some countrieshave tried to ban crypto-assets altogether (e.g. Morocco) while others are fostering theirdevelopment (e.g. Malta).On the other hand, the distributed ledger technology (DLT) underlying some digital currenciesschemes, offers potential benefits that go far beyond digital currencies themselves. A distributedledger technology is used as a decentralized minting and transaction processing platform, withcopies of all the transactions ever performed distributed on a public network of computingservers. A transaction on such a network is completed when the majority of the servers in thenetwork achieve consensus that it is valid, using cryptographic identification techniques (private-public keys and hash functions), thus eliminating the need for a trusted party (e.g. central bank).DLT is likely to change mainly securities clearing and settlement operations. A key feature ofdistributed ledger networks as payment platforms is that the entire history of transactions –which is immutable - is available to all transactions verifiers in real time. A copy of the transactionledger is stored in all participating agents Data Centers and thus cannot be easily compromised;at the same time it is easily verifiable and readily auditable.Bank of Canada experimented on a DLT-based wholesale payment system (the so called“Project Jasper”) and concluded that core wholesale payment systems function quite efficientlybut there could be some benefits from the interaction with a larger DLT ecosystem of financialmarket infrastructures, including cross-border transactions. In a recent speech, the IMF statesthat DLT could be applied to various processes in cross boarder payments and gains would bemost evident in efficiency. Bank of England has expressed the view that there is scope forcentral banking and the financial system more broadly to benefit from the settlement technology.But many colleagues stress that the DLT is not perfected yet as technology and it has not beenadequately tried. To central banks it remains at an experimental stage at present.Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC)I will now move to an interrelated discussion that focuses on the desirability of central banks toprovide digital currencies through distributed ledger technologies in a decentralized fashion.Lately, the prospect of central bank cryptocurrencies is attracting attention. Central banks aredrawn to the idea of issuing a fast, efficient, digital currency that does not carry the cost ofsecuring, distributing and processing physical banknotes and coins and that can be tracked inreal time as it moves through the financial system. The development of DLT in recent years nowprovides the possibility of a supplement to physical cash in the form of central bank digitalcurrencies. The Bank of England was among the first central banks to take notice of thefeasibility of a central bank digital currency, and other monetary authorities have since followed.CBDC is a potential new form of digital central bank money. In the current banking system, onlycommercial banks hold digital money in deposit at the central bank, i.e. reserves. By introducingan universally accessible CBDC, every household and business would be enabled to hold directclaims against the central bank. In practice, the central bank would guarantee free convertibility atpar (i.e. 1:1). This practice would make the digital currency a secure store of value, incentivizingindividuals and businesses to hold the CBDC. One major issue, however, is whether the CBDCshould be an interest bearing asset or not.4567 3 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
There are two cases:A) CBDC pays no interest, just like paper currency.In this case, households and companies would be incentivized to hold most of their liquid fundsin interest bearing deposit accounts at commercial banks, keeping the use of the digital currencyfairly modest. However, this form of digital currency would constrain the ability of central banks topush interest rates below zero during periods of weak aggregate demand and deflation becausedepositors would swiftly move their funds into digital currency paying zero interest. Thus, theeffective zero lower bound on interest rates would become a more binding constraint formonetary policy.B) CBDC is introduced as an interest bearing currency.In this case, the central bank would pay interest for digital currency accounts held at the centralbank by individuals, companies and banks, similar to the deposit facility for commercial banks. Ifthe digital currency bears interest, it will likely affect the demand for physical cash out ofcirculation, at least to a large extent. In a recent working paper of Bank of England, CBDC isdefined as “a central bank granting universal, electronic, 24x7, national-currency-denominatedand interest-bearing access to its balance sheet”.Furthermore, with an interest bearing CBDC, still only if we assume that zero-interest bearingpaper currency eventually disappears, the constraint of an effective lower bound will be removedand thereby there will be no need for alternative monetary tools such as quantitative easing orfiscal interventions.Introducing CBDC as an interest bearing security has its merits, as explained above, but itcomes also with great risks. One major question is the following: if money users have access torisk free central bank money, why would they hold risky commercial bank deposits?This gives rise to Gresham’s law, namely that “bad money drives out good money”, particularlyduring periods of banking crises. Therefore, the impact on the balance sheets of the commercialbanks would be the same as in a classical bank run. Banks would increasingly lose the ability toattract deposits, creating a potential for more destructive financial crises. Moreover, without theability to attract deposits, banks would lose their ability to provide credit; hence they would losetheir core function as financial intermediaries in the economy.There are other reasons why some central banks, for example in the Scandinavian countries,might view CBDC particularly favourably. At a time of rapidly declining paper currency circulation,this could maintain the central bank’s seignorage revenues while preserving some public, trust-enhancing, element in money. The advent of digital currencies can help increase financialinclusion and thereby expand the size of the formal economy.

high standard of living we now enjoy and has made finance more “democratic”. For example,crowdfunding has enabled access to finance to a greater part of the society, while usingsmartphone apps we can now make mobile payments.Yet, digital currency is something else.I am not sure whether digital currency will become a substitute of cash in the near future sincemany important questions remain unanswered. Cryptocurrencies have no intrinsic value, onlyvalue in exchange. Their value derives from the hope, to quote Yves Mersch, “of finding a greaterfool to sell to before the inevitable crash” . There is also the crucial point which AugustinCarstens makes  that usage of crypto-assets “relies on the oxygen provided by the connectionto standard means of payments and trading apps that link users to conventional bankaccounts… [We must] not allow such tokens to rely on much of the same institutionalinfrastructure that serves the overall financial system and freeload on the trust that it provides...”.Today, banks face a strategic dilemma with the emergence of DLT. Just as the Internetdecentralized the flow of information, so has the emergence of crypto instruments decentralizedvalue. And just as postal services have not disappeared, banks are not about to disappear either.DLT might have many positive outcomes for banks, from reducing settlement risk andassociated capital costs, to reducing costs associated with back office functions, to thepossibility of reducing core banking system costs as the DLT may replace much of the need fora banking general ledger in the future. But we remain still far from this point.Digitalization in finance opens up bewildering opportunities. Central banks should capitalize onthem but without losing sight of the potential risks. The Bank of Greece and the ECB haveseveral reasons to be interested in developments in digital currencies. We cannot predict theexact direction the innovations will take but we will certainly continue to monitor developmentsand assess their implications.(1) Esselink, H. and L.

It may no longer be fashionable to say so.  Measures of economic growth, like Gross Domestic Product (GDP), can be highly imperfect metrics of how well individuals and societies are faring, their subjective sense of well-being.1  And growth in income and output is not, of course, an end in itself.    Nonetheless, it is now pretty well-established that growth is a vital ingredient, indeed pre-requisite, for meeting many of the broader societal objectives many would view as important to our longer-term health, wealth and happiness.2  While not an end in itself, economic growth appears to be a vitally important means of achieving those societal ends.  Economic growth is the main reason why global levels of poverty and rates of infant mortality have fallen spectacularly over recent centuries.  It is why longevity and educational standards have risen secularly over the same period.  And growth may even have contributed to the incidence of global conflicts and wars having fallen to their lowest levels, perhaps in human history.3  That makes growth a gift, one necessary (if not necessarily sufficient) to deliver secular improvements in living standards.  And it is what makes a good understanding of the determinants and drivers of growth so crucial for societal progress.  By understanding the forces driving growth, past, present and future, we can begin to devise and implement economic policies that support improvements in society.  I thought I understood the story of economic growth, its drivers and determinants.  But recently I have changed my mind.  I have a new story of growth.  I think this story carries important implications for understanding the future challenges of technology and for devising the future policies and institutions necessary to meet them.  That might require, among other things, a repurposing of successful institutions like this one, turning them from universities into multiversities.   The Story of Growth  The story of economic growth often begins with a chart like this one (Chart 1).  This plots the path of global economic growth, measured by Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per head, over the past 1000 years.  And what a story it tells.  It is a tale of two halves – or, more accurately, a tale of three-quarters and a quarter.4    For the first three-quarters of the past 1000 years, the global economy stood still in growth terms.  GDP growth per head of population averaged less than 0.1% per year.  Just try and imagine those rates of growth.  They meant it took more than a millennium for living standards to double.                                                          1  Stiglitz, Sen and Fitoussi (2009). 2  For example, Coyle (2014).   3  Two recent excellent books (Pinker (2018), Rosling (2018)) chart this and other dramatic improvements in societal well-being over time.   4  De Long (1998).

The average person would not see any improvement in living standards over their lifetime.  Their lived experience was imperceptibly different than their parents, grandparents or indeed great, great grandparents.  People’s lives were lived on a travellator.  Rising living standards was not a social norm.  Secular stagnation was.  You could argue, with some justification, that measures of GDP at this time might have been missing a trick.  We did not have any formal, statistical means of measuring incomes and outputs in the economy until well into the 20th century, with the development of the National Accounts.  And GDP anyway underplays important factors shaping people’s well-being, such as levels of nutrition, infant mortality and longevity.5  Yet, as best we can tell, alternative well-being metrics tell broadly the same story.6  Rates of infant mortality were unchanged over this period.  Life expectancy flat-lined at 30 to 40 years.  Levels of calorific intake stood still.  And the global population scarcely budged, held in check by unchanged food supplies, as predicted by Thomas Malthus in the late 18th century.7  Not for nothing was this called the Malthusian era.   Another example of this secular stagnation, a favourite of mine, is provided by plotting heights from excavated skeletons records.  These are a diagnostic on levels of health and nutrition.  Male skeleton heights were essentially unchanged, at 160-170cm, for at least 2,000 years prior to 1750.  Humans grew neither physiologically nor financially.  And neither, then, did the societies in which they lived.    That makes the contrast with developments in the last quarter of the millennium all the more striking.  From around 1750, GDP per head suddenly took off and has kept on rising ever since, growing by around 1.5% per year.  The magic of compound interest means these growth rates have transformed people’s living standards.  The time it takes for living standards to double has shrunk to less than 50 years.    The impact on people’s well-being, financial and psychological, has been transformational.  It has meant each generation has been around 50% better off than its predecessor.  After 1750, generational progress suddenly became visible, children to parents to grandparents.  Growth in living standards became a social norm, in a way never previously true in human history.  Life’s travellator turned into an escalator.  And not just for GDP.  Broader metrics of well-being tell a similar tale.  Rates of infant mortality have fallen by 40 percentage points since the end of the 18th century.8  The estimated lifespan of a human has risen by a factor of over two.9  And estimated male skeleton heights have risen by 5-10cm.10  Humans have grown, financially and physiologically, in lockstep.  The world has moved from a Malthusian Era to a Golden one.                                                        5  Stiglitz, Sen and Fitoussi (2009). 6  For example, Clark (2009).   7  Malthus (1798). 8  Our World In Data:  https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality 9  Our World In Data:  https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy 10  Haldane (2015a). 
  All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 4  4   A Story with One “i”   What explains this extra-ordinary inflexion point in the history of economic growth and living standards?  So fundamental is this question to so much of social and economic history that, understandably, it has attracted huge amounts of empirical, historical, social and theoretical research.  Out of this cloud of evidence, a clear sunbeam of understanding has emerged about the deep causes and catalysts of economic growth.    If you ask a schoolchild what happened in England around the middle of the 18th century, as I often do, many will give you the right answer.  It marked the dawn of the Industrial Revolution.  But what exactly was this a revolution in and what exactly caused it?  In the standard account, the catalyst for this revolution in economic growth came from a single source, from one “i” - ideas.11  In the second half of the 18th century in the UK, ideas began sprouting like morning mushrooms.  These ideas emerged seemingly spontaneously and roughly contemporaneously.  They were also relatively closely clustered geographically.  They included James Hargreaves’ spinning jenny in 1764, Richard Arkwright’s water frame in 1769 and James Watt’s steam engine in 1775.  In the fullness of time, these ideas began to revolutionise both industry and work.  After a lengthy adoption lag, they spread across sectors and across regions.  They migrated from being mere ideas to becoming “GPTs” or General Purpose Technologies.12  In the process, they generated waves of investment in new factories, machines, processes and infrastructures.  There was, in the jargon, capital-deepening.  Neo-Classical theories of economic growth are very clear what would be expected to happen next.13  When an outward shift in the economy’s technological frontier is combined with higher levels of physical capital, the fuse is lit on higher productivity among companies, higher wages among workers and, ultimately, higher living standards among societies.  So it was during the Golden Era.   Chart 2 plots productivity, wages and GDP per head in the UK since the Industrial Revolution.  All three plateaued prior to 1750.  Since then, all three have moved up in lockstep.  Ideas and innovation have borne continuous fruit in higher productivity, pay and living standards.  This fruit has been shared roughly equally between owners of companies (profits) and workers in companies (wages).  We know that because labour’s share of the national income pie is similar today to 1750.  Of course, it is not ideas and innovation from the 18th century that has sustained growth over the subsequent period.  Although the innovation process is continuous, historians often point to three distinct waves – three Industrial Revolutions.  The second came in the latter part of the 19th century with the emergence of GPTs                                                         11  For example, Romer (1990) describes a theoretical model of growth based around innovation.   12  Bresnahan and Trajtenberg (1995). 13  For example, Mokyr (2011) discusses Britain during the Industrial Revolution. 
  All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 5  5   such as electricity, the internal combustion engine and sanitation.  The third came in the middle of the  20th century with new GPTs such as computing, digitisation and the internet.14    Yet in each case the playbook was familiar from the first Industrial Revolution.  The emergence of a new strain of GPTs resulted in an outward shift in the production possibility frontier and capital-deepening.  With higher levels of investment in physical and human capital, the productivity of companies, the wages of workers and the living standards of societies continued their Northerly ascent.  The Golden Era continued.    Some people are now discussing the next innovation wave, a so-called Fourth Industrial Revolution.  The GPTs driving this are likely to include Artificial Intelligence (AI), Big Data, automation, robotics, 3D-printing and nano-technology.15  I will return to the Fourth Industrial Revolution when discussing future growth.  A Different Growth Story  As appetising as this growth story sounds, a reading of the history books make it difficult to swallow whole.  It is certainly plausible to think that a divine coincidence of Hargreaves, Watts and Arkwrights, in roughly the same place at roughly the same time, resulted in a white-hot crucible of creativity.  Indeed, we might be seeing that self-same crucible of creativity in Silicon Valley today.  But the Industrial Revolution was hardly the first firing of that crucible.  We have, through history, seen many episodes of furnace-hot crucibles of innovation, spanning most continents and most centuries.16  Successful cities, regions, countries, continents and empires of the recent and distant past were often built and sustained on ideas and innovation and accompanying investment in machines and people.  The Roman Empire is a case in point.  Some of you will remember the sequence from Monty Python’s The Life of Brian which begins with the rhetorical question:  “What did the Romans ever do for us?”  The sketch concludes:  “But apart from better sanitation and medicine and education and irrigation and public health and roads and a freshwater system and baths and public order...what have the Romans done for us?”    You do not need to go that far back for examples of big ideas which had a transformative impact on industry and society.  Immediately prior to the Industrial Revolution and running chronologically, these included the windmill in the 12th century, the mechanical clock in the 13th, the cannon in the 14th, the printing press in the 15th, the postal service in the 16th and the telescope and microscope in the 17th.17   It will surprise no-one that waves of innovation, big and small, have been lapping the shores of society for the entirety of human civilisation.  In other words, while ideas and innovation may well be a necessary condition                                                       14  Van Reenen et al (2010), for example, document the economic impact of ICT. 15  See Bughin et al (2017) and Haldane (2018), for example. 16  Flohr (2016), for example, discusses innovation in Roman society. 17  Clark (2009). 
  All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 6  6   for economic growth, the historical record suggests they may not themselves have been sufficient.  Other forces appear to have been at play, translating these ideas into sustained growth in living standards.  What might those forces be?  I want to provide two different, but complementary, lenses on the growth story.  The first focusses on a rather broader set of “capitals” – not just physical capital (plant and machines) but human (skills and expertise), intellectual (ideas and technologies), infrastructural (transport and legal systems), social (co-operation and trust) and institutional (national and civic, private and public) capital.18    History suggests each of these capitals may have played an important supporting role in the story of growth.  Ideas alone, without the support of one or more of these broader capitals, have historically run aground.  For example, in the UK many of the foundations for growth after the Industrial Revolution were laid in the centuries preceding it.  It was on this platform of “capitals”, plural, that ideas and innovation then built.  Take human capital.  The most dramatic improvements in educational standards in the UK occurred prior to 1750 (Chart 3).  So too did the largest improvements in measures of social, infrastructural and institutional capital.19  Ideas needed these foundations to flourish.  A steam engine is not much use without the skills to build it, the tracks to run it on, the institutions to oversee it, the trust of the public to accept it.  The causes of the growth inflexion in 18th century England were as much sociological as technological.   Another lens through which to view this alternative growth story has recently been provided by economic historians, Steve Broadberry and John Wallis.20  Indeed it was probably this lens on the world, above all others, that led me to change my own story about growth.  Broadberry and Wallis do two things.  First, they construct some new estimates of growth going back to 1300.  Rather than relying on period averages, they use higher-frequency measures of growth.  This changes the growth picture significantly.  Period averages conceal large, long-lasting swings in growth over time (Chart 4).  Their revised measures suggest growth did not flat-line prior to 1750, even though it averaged zero.  Rather, growth oscillated wildly.    Second, given the scale and duration of these oscillations, they decompose their growth data into “expanding” and “contracting” periods.  Chart 5 plots these for the UK over the past 700 years.  A broadly similar pattern of expanding and contracting periods can be found in Spain, France, Italy, Portugal, and the Netherlands over roughly the same period.  This decomposition changes the growth story radically.  Even prior to the Industrial Revolution, economies experienced notable periods of strongly positive growth.  Between 1300 and 1700, GDP expanded slightly more than half the time.  Over these expanding periods, growth averaged 5.3% per year.  The reason average growth was far-lower over this earlier period – indeed,                                                       18  Solow (1956), Mincer (1984), Romer (1990), Iyer, Kitson and Toh (2005), North (1990). 19  Haldane (2015a).   20  Broadberry and Wallis (2017).

They accounted for slightly less than half the period, during which growth averaged minus 5.4% per year.  So what has changed in the period since the Industrial Revolution?  Growth during expansion periods is relatively little changed.  Since 1750, it has averaged 3.2% per year.  That is in fact a bit less than growth during expansion periods prior to the Industrial Revolution.  This strongly implies it is not the greater incidence of ideas-fuelled booms after 1750 that accounts for the growth inflexion.    The explanation lies instead in the dramatic fall in both the probability and cost of GDP contractions.  Recessions have occurred only 30% of the time since 1700 and only 17% of the time since 1900.  During these periods, growth has averaged minus 2.2% per year since 1700 and minus 3.4% per year since 1900.  Since 1750, recessions have become far less frequent and less painful.  It is the avoidance of deep recessions that differentiates the Golden Era from its Malthusian predecessor.   Where does this leave our story of growth?  Well, the story that better fits the facts appears to be one in which the conveyor belt of ideas and innovation has been continuous over the centuries, causing lengthy if lumpy ideas-fuelled expansions.  But whereas prior to the Industrial Revolution this conveyor belt was regularly halted by recessions, more recently these interruptions have been far fewer and less costly.  Put differently, the real revolution in living standards after 1750 came about not exclusively, or perhaps even mainly, from the surge in ideas and technologies.  Rather, it resulted from societies having found some means of avoiding the subsequent recessionary bullets.  Prior to the Industrial Revolution, these killed expansions dead.  After it, societies appear to have found some effective means of dodging them.   A Second “i” on Growth  To understand growth, then, we need to explain why economies become less recession-prone after 1750.  For me, the explanation lies in a second “i” – institutions.  I will argue that it was the emergence of institutions that explains the rise in the other capitals that were essential pre-conditions for growth (human, social, infrastructural, intellectual etc.)  It was the emergence of these same institutions which also cushioned the damaging effects of recessions.  As with sight, to gain a true perspective on growth you need two “i"s.  This is, in one sense, not a new story.  A number of distinguished economists have, over the years, placed institutions centre-stage in explaining secular trends in social and economic development.  They include classical economists such as Adam Smith and John Stuart Mill and, more recently, Nobel Laureates such as Ronald Coase and Douglass North.21  Broadberry and Wallis themselves conclude that the most likely cause of fewer downside growth surprises since the Industrial Revolution has been the rise of institutions.                                                          21  Smith (1776), Mill (1848), Coase (1960), North (1991). 
  All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 8  8   Empirical work supports the institutional hypothesis.  Cross-country growth regressions suggest nations with high-quality institutions out-grow those without.22  Detailed country case studies reach a similar conclusion.  For example, institutional quality has been used to explain the very different economic fortunes of North and South Korea after separation.  The absence of institutions is, for some, Why Nations Fail.23    If institutions hold the key, what exactly do we mean by them and how exactly do they come about?  Douglass North’s definition is a good starting point:  “humanly devised constraints that structure political, economic and social interactions”.24  So defined, institutions are social infrastructure.  They include formal or legal institutions, like Parliaments, judiciaries, central banks, social safety nets and schools.  But they also include less formal associations and groups, such as universities, trade unions, guilds and charities.  As for their genesis, history suggests institutions emerge for a variety of reasons.  Sometimes they have been a direct response to political upheaval.  Some of the largest transformations in political institutions have resulted from revolutions:  in the UK, after the Glorious Revolution of the 17th century, in France after the French Revolution of the 18th century, in the United States after the Civil War of the 19th century.    At other times, institutions have emerged in response to the pressing financial or social needs of citizens.  Often, those times of most pressing financial and social need have coincided with sharp changes in the economic environment which have left large swathes of society worse-off.  And often, technological disruption and displacement have been the root cause of these sharp changes in the economic environment.  The three Industrial Revolutions provide a useful set of case studies.  Each caused technological disruption and significant job displacement.  Each had, as a result, a wrenching and lasting impact on the job and income prospects of large swathes of society.  Each caused a significant and sustained period of hardship for many.25  And each caused a stretching of the social fabric, often to close to breaking point.  It is now well-established that each industrial revolution caused a significant loss of livelihood for workers whose set of tasks was most susceptible to automation.  The upshot, often, has been a “hollowing out” of jobs across the skill distribution.26  Because reskilling and retraining takes time and effort, job displacement worsens pay prospects for a great many, significantly and persistently.27  And these losses were often made worse because they were concentrated occupationally and geographically.28  A second, accompanying adverse side-effect of technological disruption has often been rising levels of income inequality.  Historically, those skilling-up to keep one step ahead of the machine saw demand for                                                       22  Levine and Renelt (1992). 23  Acemoglu and Robinson (2012). 24  North (1990). 25  Haldane (2015b). 26  Katz and Margo (2013), for example, show that skilled blue collar employment in US manufacturing declined while white collar and unskilled manufacturing employment increased. 27  Autor (2017) documents lower relative wages for those in US most exposed to international competition. 28  Autor (2017).

By contrast, those at the other end of the skills distribution saw their incomes fall, due to reduced demand and increased supply of their skills.  The resulting rise in income inequality has tended, historically, to heighten popular discontent and worsen social cohesion.    A third adverse side-effect was that workers did not always benefit, fully or immediately, from  technologically-induced gains in companies’ productivity and profitability.  In the early stages of each industrial revolution, wages tended not to rise in line with productivity, causing labour’s share of the national income pie to fall.29  This, too, tended to add to popular discontent and damage social cohesion.  Labour’s income share has also fallen in a number of advanced economies over the past few decades.30  A final side-effect is that periods of technological transition were often lengthy as well as painful.  In the first Industrial Revolution, many displaced workers had still to find alternative work by the middle of the  19th century, with income inequality running high and labour’s share falling.  This period is known by historians as “Engel’s pause”.31  Subsequent industrial revolutions have seen similar, if less long-lived, pauses.  If economic hardship is widespread and social cohesion damaged, a societal response is needed.  One such response is the creation of new pieces of social infrastructure – in other words, institution building.  Each industrial revolution saw a surge in such institution-building, to cushion the adverse side-effects of technological change on jobs and pay.  In this way, the recessionary hit to workers and the economy could be shortened or dampened.   Broadly speaking, two such sets of institution emerged.    One set equipped workers with the new skills they needed to thrive in a new jobs environment.  It was only by acquiring these skills that workers could transition to where new jobs were being created.  By keeping one step ahead of the machine, technological unemployment could be avoided.  A shorter, more seamless skills transition reduced the hit to workers’ incomes and lowered the risk of skills atrophy, which might otherwise cause lasting damage to employment.  This social infrastructure might be called “enabling” institutions.    Another set of institutions provided workers with support to cushion the hit to their finances and well-being during the painful and lengthy period of job transition.  This might be financial support, in income or loans.  It might be housing or shelter.  Or it might be social or emotional support.  This social insurance ensured that lives were underpinned, inequalities held in check and the social fabric held together.  It reduced recession risk, for individuals and for societies.  These might be called “insuring” institutions.32                                                        29  Allen (2005) documents the stagnation of real wages in Britain from 1800 to 1840.   30  IMF (2017). 31  Allen (2009) discusses Engels’ pause in the context of the British economy from 1760 to 1913. 32  Of course, many other institutions played a role in the labour market beyond the “enabling” and “insuring” ones mentioned here.  For example, the ‘Poor Laws’ in the 1800s meant that the poor had to enter workhouses with terrible conditions to receive help in the form of clothes and food.   
  All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 10  10   During the first three Industrial Revolutions, the skills workers needed to keep one step ahead of the machine were largely cognitive.  Machines undertook largely manual (“doing”) tasks, which had previously used labour-intensive technologies.  Cognitive (“thinking”) tasks remained, by and large, the exclusive domain of humans.  So institutions emerged to nurture thinking skills, largely in children and young adults, to increase the chances of successful transition to the cognitively-intensive future world of work.    In children, the most important of these institutional innovations was probably compulsory schooling.  For children between the ages of 5 and 10, this was formally introduced in the UK with the Elementary Education Act of 1880.  It was extended to age 11 in 1893 and age 12 in 1899.  The Fisher Act of 1918 provided for compulsory education to age 14 and part-time education to age 18.  Compulsory full-time education was extended to age 15 in 1947 and age 16 in 1972.33    As these pieces of social infrastructure developed, so too did standards of educational attainment and cognitive skills.  The fraction of the population aged 15 and over that attended secondary school rose from 23% to 60% between 1950 and 2010.34  In the 1950s, less than 11% of the relevant age group passed five or more GCSE O levels in England and Wales.  By 2010, that had reached almost 80%.35  Beyond age 18, there was in parallel a rise in both numbers and attendance at universities.  For over six hundred years from 1209, England had only two universities – this one (Oxford) and the other one (Cambridge).  It was not until the formation of University College London in 1829 that their duopoly was broken.  And it was not until the 20th century that some of the other main cities – Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, Bristol, Birmingham and Sheffield – established their own universities.36  Today, there are around 130 universities in the UK as a whole.  Participation rates in higher education have also undergone a secular rise and, latterly, a revolution.  The share of young people attending university has increased from just over 3% in 1950 to over 8% in 1970, over 19% in 1990, 33% in 2000 and 49% by 2016.37  Having been less than 5,000 in 1920, the number of first degrees obtained at UK universities had increased to over 365,000 by 2016. 38  Through the rapid rise in school and university attendance, there was a revolution in cognitive skills in the workforce.  That provided the human capital necessary to turn new technologies and machines into higher levels of productivity among companies, higher wages among workers and, ultimately, higher living standards among societies.  Put differently, higher cognitive skills reduced the odds of a lengthy recessionary period of technological unemployment for many individuals and societies.                                                          33  Legislative dates for compulsory schooling vary from dates of enforcement. 34  Barro-Lee Educational Attainment Dataset:  http://www.barrolee.com/ 35  Bolton (2012).   36  Willetts (2017). 37  Bolton (2012) for data from 1950 to 2000.  2016 data from Department of Education. 38  Bolton (2012) and Universities UK (2017).

Providing them with access to finance or housing is another.  This support helped smooth the hit to incomes and lifestyles brought about by job displacement.  Starting in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, financial institutions began to emerge to provide financial support through bridging loans, often operating on collective or co-operative principles.  In the UK, the Friendly Societies Act of 1819 established today’s credit unions.  The Regulation of Benefit Building Societies Act followed in 1836.  Other sets of institution emerged to support workers in wider ways.  Trade unions grew in importance during the 18th century, as workers’ jobs were hollowed-out and their share of the income pie was consumed.  Unions gained rights progressively during the 19th century, culminating in the foundation of the Trade Union Congress (TUC) in 1868.  The Trade Union Act of 1871 gave unions fully-fledged legal status.    Trade unions helped workers by campaigning to protect their rights, improve their conditions and boost their bargaining power in the workplace.  They also provided direct financial support to unemployed workers, through an early form of unemployment insurance, to smooth the income consequences for workers of job loss.  The National Insurance Act (1911) and the Beveridge Report (1942) subsequently made this a responsibility of the state and put it on a comprehensive footing.  This was part of a wider-ranging shift in the role played by the state in society from the 17th century onwards.  State spending as a proportion of national income rose from around 1% in the 16th century to around 12% in the 18th, 14% in the 19th and 33% in the 20th.39  It financed social infrastructure of various kinds supporting those facing greatest hardship.  This ranged from social housing to healthcare to income support.  Its effect was to cap the downside, recessionary risk to individuals, economies and societies.40  Another form of institutional support came from the creation of state-owned and/or central banks.  The Bank of England was set up at the end of the 17th century to manage the government’s debt and safeguard the nation’s currency and finances.  Over the course of subsequent centuries, this role has expanded.  Since at least the middle of the 19th century, the Bank of England has become one of the key institutional safeguards against recession risk and financial crisis.41  Indeed, today, those roles are defined in statute.  Non-state institutions have also played an important role in protecting those facing the adverse side-effects of economic change.  This included many religious, philanthropic and charitable organisations and citizen movements that emerged from the 18th century onwards, often as a direct response to hardship brought about by technological change.  These institutions offered, and many continue to offer, a combination of financial, housing, training and emotional support to those in need.                                                        39  Clark (2009).  Figures refer to government command of output as a percentage of GNP in England. 40  Other 19th century legal changes that supported individuals from adverse side-effects of economic change included recognition of limited liability companies and constraints on the ability of courts to sentence debtors to prison.  41  Anson et al (2017), for example, discuss the emergence of the Bank of England as lender of last resort.

It was established explicitly to meet the housing and social needs of young men who had moved from rural towns and villages to find work in factories in the cities.   It soon grew into a regional, and in time global, network offering financial, housing, training and social support, to both men and women, cushioning the recessionary hit to societies.  And that remains its role today.   The story, then, is of a social infrastructure emerging to support workers and societies buffeted by technological change.  These institutions aimed either to reduce the length or to limit the costs of adjustment by displaced workers.  By enhancing skills and mitigating hardships, the incidence and cost of recessionary adjustment was reduced, for individuals and societies.  And this, ultimately, was the difference between the living standards escalator of the Golden Era and the travellator of its Malthusian predecessor.    Joseph Schumpeter spoke powerfully about the forces of “creative destruction”.42  The lesson of history seems to be that we need both to “cultivate the creative” and to “disarm the destructive” if innovation is to translate into rising levels of social, human and infrastructural capital and, then, higher living standards.  It is only by establishing strong institutional roots that technological fruit can subsequently be harvested.  Future Growth and Future Institutions  From the past and present to the future.  What lies in store for future economic growth?  It is difficult to know with any confidence.  But if history is any guide, the story of growth will hinge on the interplay between the two “i”s – the disruptive forces of innovation on the one hand, the stabilising role of institutions on the other.    There is an active debate underway on the first of these – the likely future path of innovation.  Some have recently argued that the pace of innovation may be declining.43  The argument here is that many of the  low-hanging fruit from the ICT revolution have already been picked.  Diminishing returns to R&D may have set in.  And other secular forces – including adverse demographics and rising inequality – may have acted as additional headwinds to growth.44  This view sometimes goes by the name secular stagnation.45  An alternative school of thought believes we may instead be on the cusp of a new great wave of innovation, a Fourth Industrial Revolution.46  This revolution in innovation will, it is said, be jet-propelled by a set of potentially new GPTs, among them AI, Big Data and robotics.  For technology optimists, the story is one of secular innovation, not stagnation.  And on this view, the potential gains in productivity and growth could be as large as any of the earlier industrial revolutions.47                                                          42  Schumpeter (1942). 43  Gordon (2012), Fernald (2014). 44  Summers (2013) and Rachel and Smith (2015).  45  Secular stagnation theory was originally proposed by Hansen (1938) in the aftermath of the Great Depression 46  Brynjolfsson and McAfee (2014) discuss ‘The Second Machine Age’. 47  Brynjolfsson, Rock and Syverson (2017). 
  All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 13  13   Typically, the two sides of this argument are taken to be in a secular struggle:  the dark forces of secular stagnation pitted against the dynamic forces of secular innovation.  Yet in practice, both arguments have merit.  They are certainly not mutually incompatible.  It is perfectly possible to imagine a world of rapid innovation which nonetheless leaves large swathes of society in its slipstream.  More than that, recent research suggests this is a likely outcome of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.  There are good conceptual grounds for thinking the displacement effects of the Fourth Industrial Revolution may be larger than ever-previously.  Every industrial revolution has resulted in a hollowing-out, typically of mid-skilled tasks.  Historically, that has meant largely manual, labour-intensive tasks.  Machine has replaced human in activities that are routine and repetitive.  The future could well be very different.  For example, the dawning of AI means that humans will no longer having the cognitive playing field to themselves.  Thinking or non-routine tasks may increasingly be taken up by machines.  They will be able to process more quickly, more cheaply and with fewer errors than their human counterpart, at least in some activities.  That could make the hollowing-out of human tasks, now cognitive as well as manual, far greater than ever before.48   A cottage industry has emerged over recent years manufacturing estimates of job loss that might result from this rise of the robots.  As an early contributor to this industry, I am at least partly to blame.49  The estimates of gross job loss span a pretty wide range, but lie anywhere between 10% and 50% of the global workforce, depending on whether it is jobs or tasks that are assumed to be displaced (Table 1 summarises).  Even at the lower end of this range, the societal impact would be significant.  At the upper end, they would be truly transformative.  If the truth lies in between, this could still make the jobs loss from the Fourth Industrial Revolution greater than its predecessors.  And if so, then the potential societal costs – such as rising wage inequality and threats to social cohesion – could also be as great as ever previously.50    Some of the potentially powerful effects of automation on jobs and wages are already apparent.  In the US, each industrial robot per thousand workers has been found to reduce the employment rate by  0.2-0.3 percentage points and wages by 0.25-0.5%.51  In Europe, results are more mixed.52  Research suggests that technology may have been the largest single contributor to falling labour shares over the recent past.53   Whether these effects on jobs and pay will be temporary or permanent is far harder to judge.  At this stage of the technological cycle, the evidence is more likely to be picking up the shorter-term displacement effects of                                                       48  Haldane (2015b) 49  Haldane (2015b). 50  Schwab (2017). 51  Acemoglu and Restrepo (2017). 52  For example, Dauth, Findeisen, Südekum and Woßner (2017). 53  IMF (2017).

It is the balance of these two effects, each large in gross terms, which will ultimately determine where unemployment will settle.54    No one could say with confidence today the long-run net effect will be.  What can be said with confidence is that the scale of gross displacement may be larger than ever-previously.  This means that, if technological unemployment is to be avoided, positive effects on productivity, goods and jobs will also have to be commensurately larger.  That has led some to argue that technological unemployment is more likely this time around.55   Even if it is avoided, the societal costs of transition could well be larger, in terms of rising wage inequality, a falling labour share and damage to social cohesion.  And if that recessionary impact of technological change on individuals and societies is sufficiently large, it could well call into question the merits of having pursued the creative course in the first place.  Or that, at least, is the lesson of history.  What experience since the Industrial Revolution has taught us is that this risk can be mitigated by an appropriate institutional response.  To be effective in curbing recession risk, that response should have as its objectives, first, speeding-up the process of reskilling by workers (“enabling”) and, second, cushioning the impact of new technologies on displaced companies and their workers (“insuring”).    In the face of mounting concern about the societal impact of the rise of the robots, quite a lot has been written recently on the sorts of new insurance mechanism that might be required to smooth this transition.56  Here, I will focus on two areas where new “enabling institutions” could ease the transition for workers and companies.  Both draw on one of the greatest institutional inventions of the past millennium – universities.  In 1852, John (later Cardinal) Newman published The Idea of a University, a book that has since assumed classic status as a statement of the principles by which universities should be run and organised.  There are many themes to that text.  From these, I would highlight two which have particular relevance to the debate about the future role of universities within our societies.  First, Newman emphasised universities’ role in providing a liberal education for students, by which he meant access to a range of disciplines.  Rigid specialism was to be avoided.  The capacity to think was what mattered.  Second, the role of the university was to propagate ideas, rather than necessarily generate them.  The capacity to diffuse knowledge, rather than generate it, was what mattered.   With a twist, both are relevant to the Idea of a University in the 21st century.  David Willetts, for example, emphasises the role of universities with just as much vigour as Newman in his recent book, A University Education.                                                         54  See, for example, Acemoglu and Restropo (2018) for an organising theoretical framework. 55  For example, Acemoglu and Restrepo (2017), Susskind and Susskind (2015). 56  Martinelli (2017) and Standing (2017), for example, discuss universal basic income. 
  All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 15  15   (a) Human Capital  Let me start with human capital, workers’ skills and experience.  Two fundamental shifts in the jobs and skills market are likely in the period ahead.  The first is demographic.  A young person born today can be expected to live a 100-year life.57  That being the case, it is likely they will have a career of 60, perhaps 70, years.  Given changes to the future world of work, multiple changes of career, not just job, are likely during a lifetime.  This has never before happened in human history.  The second secular shift is in the demand for skills.  In the past, this skill-shift has been uni-directional.  There has been a secular rise in demand for cognitive skills and a corresponding decline in demand for technical skills involving routine and repetitive tasks.  That is why cognitive skills have attracted a rising wage premium (Chart 6).  Put differently, demand for skills of the “head” (cognitive) have dominated those of the “hands” (technical) and, to lesser extent, those of the “heart” (social) over the past 300 years.  In the century ahead, those skill-shifts may be about to go into reverse.  To see why, we need to ask ourselves what sets of humans skills robots are likely to find it hardest to reproduce and replace in the period ahead.  My reading of the runes is that there are three areas where humans are likely to preserve some comparative (if not always absolute) advantage over robots for the foreseeable future.  The first is cognitive tasks requiring creativity and intuition (“heads”).  These might be tasks or problems whose solutions require great logical leaps of imagination rather than step-by-step hill-climbing.  Existing machine learning algorithms allow huge numbers of solution permutations can be tried quickly and costlessly.  This allows these hill-climbing algorithms to scale local peaks in record time.   Whether they scale global peaks is altogether another matter.  It is harder for machines to solve problems where it is difficult to define the solution steps in a logical sequence in advance.  Humans call solutions arrived at in this way “intuition”.  Despite rapid progress in deep learning techniques, it remains far-harder to devise search algorithms which solve problems requiring a leap into the unknown.58  Even in a world of super-intelligent machine learning, a demand is still likely to exist for people with the skills to programme, test and oversee these machines.  Some human oversight and judgemental overlay of these automated processes is still likely to be needed.  Machine design, improvement and oversight require, at least for the moment, humans and machines to operate in partnership.    The second area of prospective demand for humans skills is bespoke design and manufacture (“hands”).  Routine technical tasks are relatively simple to automate and are already well on their way to disappearing.                                                        57  Gratton and Scott (2016). 58  AlphaGoZero is one such attempt.  It is an updated version of AlphaGo, a computer programme that plays the game ‘Go’, which itself was the first software to beat a human professional player in full match. 
  All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 16  16   But the same is not true of non-routine technical tasks – for example, the creation of goods and services that are distinctive in their design, manufacture or delivery.    A rise in global wealth and income is likely to create an increasing demand for luxury goods and services of this type, whose characteristics are unique and supply constrained.  Indeed, this can be seen already in the rising demand and price of rare art and artefacts and independently-produced foodstuffs and beverages.   To meet this demand, Mark Carney has spoken about the re-emergence of a new artisan class.  If so, this would mark something of a return to our pre-industrial revolution future.59  The third, and perhaps the biggest potential growth area of all, is social skills (“hearts”).  That is, tasks requiring emotional intelligence (such as sympathy and empathy, relationship-building and negotiation skills, resilience and character) rather than cognitive intelligence alone.  These are skills a robot is likely to find it hard to replicate.  And even if they could replicate them, humans might still prefer humans to carry them out.  The future could see a world of work in which EQ rivals IQ for skill supremacy.  Professions involving high degrees of personal and social interaction – such as health, caring, education and leisure – could see demand rise.  Indeed, it is possible the balance between cognitive and social skills might alter significantly even among jobs which traditionally have been cognitively-intense.  Take medicine.  The doctor of the future might be valued far less for their clinical competence in diagnosing illness and prescribing solutions.  In a world of individual medical records and data-hungry diagnostic algorithms, much of the process of diagnosis and prescription might fall to machine rather than human.  Indeed, the UK Prime Minister has recently suggested a strategy to deliver just that.60  But that is unlikely by itself to eradicate the need for doctors.  Patients are still likely to want to discuss their diagnosis and prescription.  And they will want this advice delivered personally and empathetically.  In surveys of patient satisfaction it is a doctor’s bedside manner, rather than clinical competence, that matters most.61  In future, that balance between social and clinical skills may shift further.  And, most likely, those social skills will be demanded from flesh-and-blood rather than robo-doctors.     If both the nature of a career and the skills it requires are changing, does this carry implications for educational institutions?  That seems likely.  For decades, the primary focus of these institutions has been on providing young people with cognitive skills.  That model has worked well in meeting the needs of the  skill-shifts seen through each of the three industrial revolutions.                                                        59  Carney (2016). 60  PM speech on science and modern Industrial Strategy, available here:  https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-speech-on-science-and-modern-industrial-strategy-21-may-2018 61  For example:  https://vanguardcommunications.net/doctor-online-review-study/ 
  All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 17  17   Whether that model will meet the needs of the Fourth Industrial Revolution seems more questionable, for two reasons.  First, in future it seems very likely young and old alike will be in equal educational need – to train, retrain and retrain again through their 60 or 70-year careers.  Second, the skills these people require for the future world of work will no longer be cognitive.  Rather, they are likely to be more evenly balanced between the cognitive, technical and social - head, hands and heart.  It has become rather trite to talk of the need for “life-long learning”.  But never has the need for such learning likely to have been greater given the longer span and greater volatility in future career paths.  Making these career transitions will itself call for a particular set of skills – personal resilience, problem-solving and flexibility.  As is now well-recognised, these character attributes are best instilled in early years.    If we now turn to our existing universities and colleges, at present these do not appear to be ideally sited to meeting either of these secular shifts in educational and training need.   By and large, they are not currently configured as centres for life-long learning.  And nor, in the main, are they institutions providing a balanced educational offering of cognitive, technical and social skills.    To meet the needs of the future world of work, that might need to change.  The importance of a broad-based, Newman-style, education is likely to be greater than ever.  This might criss-cross disciplinary boundaries, as one way of increasing people’s ability to make giant logical leaps.  Those skills will be social and technical every bit as much as cognitive, with head, hands and hearts sharing equal billing.  Put this way, the future university may need to be a very different creature than in the past.  It may need to cater for multiple entry points along the age distribution, rather than focussing on the young.  And it may need to cater for multiple entry points along the skills spectrum, rather than focussing on the cognitive.  It would, in short, need to be plural rather than singular – a “multiversity”, rather than a university.   (b) Intellectual Capital  Multiversities are about spreading future skills across the workforce.  Another educational challenge is how to spread future technologies across companies.  This is crucial if ideas and innovations are to become GPTs, boosting productivity, pay and living standards.  At present, evidence on the diffusion of new technologies across firms paints a rather mixed picture.  To understand why, it is useful to recognise that two forces are at work when a new idea is diffusing through the economy.  First, there is adoption (or extensive margin) – the time it takes a new technology to first reach a country or company.  Second, there is penetration (or intensive margin) – the extent to which this technology then reshapes processes and products within a company or country.62                                                          62  Comin and Mestieri (2013a). 
  All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 18  18   Take an example like computing technology or robotics.  The adoption lag would measure the time it took for a country or company to have their first computer or robot.  The penetration rate would measure how many computers or robots the country or company had and how intensively they were used.  You would expect both to be important to the process of technological diffusion and to boosting productivity.  And, empirically, both are typically found to be important to these processes.63  So what does the evidence suggest about these twin diffusion processes?  Looking at adoption lags of a range of different technologies across countries, the time-series evidence suggests these have fallen over time.  Average adoption lags have shrunk from over a century in the 18th century, to perhaps 40-80 years in the 19th century and 20-50 years in the 20th century.64  It seems possible these lags may have fallen further entering the 21st century, with cross-border flows of information and ideas having risen to new heights.  This is a good news story for productivity.  Indeed, one of the key benefits of globalisation over the past several decades is that the freer flow of goods and services, people and capital, ideas and information, has served as vehicle for the transmission and diffusion of new technologies across borders.  Other things equal, this should have accelerated catch-up between countries operating at and inside the technological frontier.65  Other things, however, have not been equal.  Penetration rates of new technologies, once adopted, tell a different tale.  They suggest that, over time, there has been a divergence between frontier and non-frontier countries.  In other words, the intensity with which new technologies have been used has expanded more rapidly in frontier (especially Western) economies than in non-frontier (non-Western) ones.  This will have retarded catch-up between the two blocs.  It is a less encouraging story about the diffusion of innovation.  With the intensive and extensive margins of diffusion pushing in opposite directions, which has won out?  It seems to have been the forces of divergence:  slower rates of penetration of new technologies have more than counter-balanced faster rates of adoption across countries.  This has shown up in levels of productivity between frontier and non-frontier which, since around 1980, have if anything diverged.    Chart 7 illustrates that.  It compares levels of productivity across 44 countries since 1950 relative to the frontier country (the US).  Convergence prior to 1980 has given way to divergence subsequently.  That divergence in levels of productivity has, in turn, translated into divergence in levels of GDP per head across countries over the same period.66  The process of livings standards catch-up has stalled, possibly reversed.  And the reason for that appears to be a slowing in rates of technological diffusion.  If there has been a slowing in rates of technological diffusion across countries, is the same potentially true within countries?  Evidence using micro-level company data within countries suggests it is.  Research by the                                                       63  Comin and Mestieri (2013a). 64  Comin and Mestieri (2013b). 65  Baddeley (2006). 66  Comin and Mestieri (2013b). 
  All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 19  19   OECD suggests there has been a slowing in rates of technological diffusion across firms in a number of countries.67  Put differently, there is a long and lengthening lower tail of companies failing to keep pace with the technologies used in frontier companies.  Their productivity performance has fallen ever-further behind.  This widening dispersion in the performance of upper and lower tail companies appears to be a particularly acute in the UK.  To a greater extent than elsewhere, it appears that the UK is a tale (or tail) of two companies.  At the upper end, the UK seems to have as many high-productivity companies as its main competitors (Chart 8).  That fits with the UK’s standing as a global innovation hub, with world-leading companies and universities and high indices of innovation by international standards.68  That is more than counter-balanced, however, by productivity performance in the lower tail.  This tail appears to be both materially longer and lower than the UK’s main international competitors (Chart 8).  Moreover, this lower tail has lengthened by more over the past decade than in those countries.69  The already slower rates of technological diffusion in the UK, by international standards, have slowed further over the recent past.  These diffusion dynamics are important to productivity and living standards.  The wider dispersion and longer lower tail of companies helps explain the UK’s roughly 30% productivity gap with, say, France and Germany.  And the widening dispersion in productivity performance between the upper and lower tails of companies helps explain the UK’s relatively poorer productivity performance than these countries over the past decade.  These diffusion dynamics are also consistent, or at least are not inconsistent, with the dawning of a Fourth Industrial Revolution.  This will have had the effect of shifting outward the technology and productivity frontier for pioneer firms.  There is clear evidence of that having happening.  Productivity among firms in the top 1% of the distribution grew, on average, by 8% per year over the ten years to 2014.  The most-productive 0.1% of firms exhibited 12% annual growth.70    As a point of comparison, the lower 99% tail of firms have experienced annual average productivity growth of less than 1% over the same period.  In other words, looking at a cross-section of UK companies, secular innovation (for the upper 1% or 0.1%) has co-existed with secular stagnation (for the remaining 99%).  The two are engaged, not so much in a secular struggle, as a secular stand-off.  Technological diffusion, and hence productivity growth, has been the casualty.   There have been one or two recent studies which have been quoted as questioning the importance of this “long tail” issue for the UK.71  These pieces use the same data used here.  The problem arises not from the data but from the (mis)interpretation placed on them by these studies.  All of these studies show, very                                                       67  Andrews, Criscuolo and Gal (2016). 68  Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (2017). 69  Haldane (2017). 70  Productivity figures refer to the non-financial business sector, but other sectors for which data are not available over the full ten-year period are also omitted. 71  Swinney (2018), Giles (2018).

Appropriately defined, they also demonstrate that this tail has lengthened during the course of the crisis.   To give one example, my Bank colleague Patrick Schneider recently published a blog post showing that a good chunk of the slowing of productivity growth since the crisis could be accounted for by workers in the top quartile of the productivity distribution.72  This is entirely consistent with the tale of two companies.  Indeed, it is evidence of the lower tail of companies with flat-lining productivity having lengthened during the crisis and by more in the UK than in competitor countries, consistent with the long tail hypothesis.   Why might the UK’s long tail, and hence technological diffusion, problem be more acute than elsewhere?  Several reasons have been posited and probed.73  One interesting window on this issue is provided by looking at the intensive and extensive diffusion margins, to see if these provide clues.  Looking at a range of ICT technologies, the data suggests that high and relatively consistent levels of technological adoption, but low and variable rates of technological penetration, mimicking the international evidence.    Take internet access.  Almost all UK businesses – in excess of 90%– now have internet access.  But the UK ranks poorly compared to other OECD countries in terms of broadband penetration (Chart 9).74  That is true not only for standard broadband connectivity, but also for more advanced infrastructure such as optical fibre connections.  Those low rates of penetration largely reflect large/small firms differences.  As with other OECD countries, broadband usage by large firms is almost 100%.  But for smaller firms that falls to 93%.  Similarly, the share of UK businesses with a website is above the OECD average, at around 83%.  But that masks sizable large/small firm differences.  Almost 100% of UK large firms use websites, which has been the case for a decade.  Only two-thirds of small firms had a website in 2007.  One may have expected that gap to close rapidly.  Even today, however, only around four-fifths of small firms have a website.  E-commerce is another technology that has arguably been surprisingly slow to propagate through the UK economy.   In 2016, over 80% of UK individuals ordered goods or services online, more than any other OECD country.  One may have expected that to have been mirrored by a large share of UK businesses selling online.  In practice, the UK is only marginally above the OECD average.  And between 2009 and 2016, the share of UK businesses making e-commerce sales increased by only 6pp, from 17% to 23%.    If the story, then, is one of diffusion dynamics being more sluggish in the UK than elsewhere, what might be done to improve matters?  Institutions, and within that universities, may well have a role to play.  At present, a relatively small sub-set of the UK’s universities operate as innovation hubs.  They conduct world-leading research using world-leading researchers.  And, in an increasing number of cases, they are doing so in tandem with businesses in spin-off science parks, acting as incubators of innovation.                                                       72  Schneider (2018). 73  Haldane (2017), Jacobs et al (2017), Swinney (2018), for instance.   74  OECD data.

To be successful, these spokes would need to be repositories of knowledge and expertise on technologies and their application to companies.  And, ideally, these repositories would have regional and sectoral reach to enable them to touch the long tail.  The UK’s existing university network would be one institutional solution to this spoke problem.  They have regional and sectoral reach.  They also have embodied expertise and knowledge.  By working in partnership with local businesses, they could serve as repositories of expertise on good company practices – in management, organisation, logistics, robotics, AI and the like.  A new set of business parks attached to these universities could serve, not so much as innovation incubators for new companies, but as diffusion clinics for existing ones.  This idea goes with the grain of the earlier proposal;  it would broaden the scope and purpose of universities.  In future, these would develop a broader set of capitals – beyond human capital (in people) to include physical and intellectual capital (in firms).  And they would do so throughout the lifecycle of companies, not just in their early years.  As it happens, this would also be consistent with Newman’s original conception of universities as diffusion-engines, every bit as much as innovation-engines.  In Germany, a network of applied research institutes, run jointly by universities and industry, has been in place since 1949.  The Fraunhofer institutes now total 72.75  Their extensive project work means they can apply technological solutions quickly to a wide variety of firms.  Each year, they engage in between  6,000-8,000 projects, large and small, with companies.  The Fraunhofer have been found to play a vital role as both innovation hubs and diffusion spokes, boosting productivity in the German economy.76    Since they first become operational in 2011, the UK now has around 10 Catapult centres, modelled on the German Fraunhofer.  These are smaller in number and scale than their German counterparts and have far less project experience.  Their focus, to date, has primarily been on acting as innovation hubs rather than diffusion spokes.  This means the UK does not currently have the diffusion infrastructure for its companies enjoyed by Germany.  This is not unimportant in explaining its longer lower tail of firms.  The UK’s university network, repurposed, could potentially provide that diffusion infrastructure.   Conclusion  The story of growth is a story with two “i”s – ideas and institutions.  The Fourth Industrial Revolution will expand the range of ideas, perhaps more than any of its predecessors.  It may also expand the range of                                                       75  https://www.fraunhofer.de/en/about-fraunhofer/profile-structure/facts-and-figures.html 76  Comin, Trumbull and Yang (2011).

In the past, new institutions have emerged to cushion this painful transition, limiting the recessionary hit to societies.  Historically, doing so appears to have held the key to sustainable growth.  If this time’s technological transition is as great as any previously, securing sustainable growth will need new institutions to manage this transition and mitigate its societal side-effects.  I have speculated on one area where that next institutional wave might usefully break – universities like this one, as new centres of lifelong learning and technological diffusion.  In future, institutional innovation will be every bit as important as technological innovation if that gift of growth is to keep on giving.

    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 2  2   I.  Introduction In recent years, this annual Mansion House dinner has been rightly cancelled in the wake of national tragedies.  Two years ago, we were united in defiance after an attack on our democracy, and more profoundly in sorrow and admiration for Jo Cox MP, a remarkable woman who had dedicated her life to helping others.  Last year, we were united in grief following the terrible fire at Grenfell Tower which claimed so many lives and scarred so many more.  And we were united in determination that such a tragedy should never happen again. Prior to this, the only other times Mansion House had not been held since its inception in 1877 were during the World Wars. When the dinner resumed in 1920, the then Governor Montagu Norman emphasised the unity that the City needed in order to return to normal. Norman’s particular unity was around “the policy” proposed by the Bank of England.  He believed “the policy was the one and only policy which ultimately would place the City and the country again on that eminence which it occupied before the war”.   Such was his confidence that Norman mentioned only once, in passing, that “the policy” in question was to “attempt to regain the gold standard”, and he spent no time at all explaining what, apart from normalcy, would be achieved by it. Of course, this return to past certainties would eventually plunge the country into deflation and a deep recession.  The old policy was not suited to the new normal and the UK was forced to abandon it a few years later. After all, what is normal when there are tectonic shifts? This dinner may look traditional, but its attendees have always recognised that the most longstanding and revered tradition of the City is its ability to anticipate, adapt to and accelerate change for the common good.   That is why the UK’s financial system remains both a national asset and a global public good.  Domestically, there are over 1 million financial services jobs, two-thirds outside London.  Financial services run a trade surplus of 3% of GDP, while the rest of the economy runs a deficit almost twice as large.  Last year, the UK financial system channelled £300 billion in finance to UK businesses and helped 700,000 households to purchase homes.  It provides pensions to 21 million people and insures the contents of 20 million homes.  It contributed 11% of annual tax revenues or over £1¼ billion per week in 2016.1                                                                  1 Employment and tax data is from “Total tax contribution of UK financial services, Tenth edition”, City of London & PWC, November 2017.

It accounts for 40% of global foreign exchange volumes and trades in over-the-counter interest rate derivatives.  More international banking activity is booked here than anywhere else.  The UK hosts the world’s second largest asset management and fourth largest insurance industry.  The City is Europe’s investment banker, and it is leading the internationalisation of green, Islamic, renminbi and rupee finance.   Being at the heart of the global financial system reinforces the ability of the rest of the UK economy, from manufacturing to the creative industries, to compete globally.  And it broadens the investment opportunities and risk-adjusted returns for UK savers. This evening, I want to set out some of the ways the UK financial system can continue to serve the UK and the world in the face of major structural changes. II.  Core attributes of UK leadership The City’s pre-eminence reflects lessons learnt over the centuries that an effective financial system must be resilient, fair and dynamic. Resilient so that it can finance households and businesses through good times and bad.  A resilient system is anti-fragile – robust even to risks we do not anticipate.   To this end, we have comprehensively reformed the financial system since the crisis.  Both capital requirements and contingent liquidity have increased ten-fold.  The major UK banks now have the balance sheets to withstand a disorderly cliff-edge Brexit, however unlikely that may be.  A series of measures have eliminated toxic forms of shadow banking and are transforming the rest into resilient market-based finance.   An effective financial system is fair:  fair to end-users and fair to the taxpayers who provide the ultimate backstop to the system. Fairness requires markets that are professional and open, in which everyone is accountable for their actions.   That is why the UK has led the global effort to address misconduct and restore trust in financial markets.  We have sharpened incentives through compensation rules that align risk and reward.  The Senior Managers Regime has re-established the link between seniority and accountability.  And the private sector is developing standards of market practice that are well understood, widely followed and up-to-date with market developments.2  An effective financial system is dynamic.  With the foundations of resilience and fairness reinforced, the UK financial sector is innovating to serve the changing real economy just as it did during three industrial revolutions and two waves of globalisation.                                                                  2 The global FICC Market Standards Board (FMSB) is developing readily understood standards for their markets.  And the global FX Committees have published the FX Global Code, the first globally consistent code of conduct for FX markets.

The UK’s openness to foreign currency banking, beginning with the creation of the Eurodollar market, spurred a renaissance of global capital flows.  This financed enormous efficiencies through new global supply chains and unprecedented prosperity by opening up emerging markets.7 Throughout the centuries, it’s been clear that private innovation works best when it is grounded in the right public infrastructure.  That includes hard infrastructure – from liquidity facilities to payments architecture – and soft infrastructure – from the rule of law to up-to-date codes of conduct and effective regulatory frameworks. This infrastructure must be overhauled now that the economy is on the cusp of the fourth industrial revolution and our demographic challenges are intensifying.  And rebalancing of the global order is proving as dramatic as it was in Montagu Norman’s time. Such profound changes demand a new finance.  And a new finance demands a new Bank. Let me set out how we are responding.                                                                  3 Brunt, L (2006), ‘Rediscovering Risk:  Country Banks as Venture Capital Firms in the First Industrial Revolution’, The Journal of Economic History, Vol. 66, No. 1, pages 74-102. 4 Mokyr, J (2009), ‘The Enlightened Economy:  An Economic History of Britain 1700-1850’, Yale University Press. 5 Hughes, J and MacDonald, S (2002), ‘International Banking:  Text and Cases’, Pearson. 6 Mokyr, J ibid. 7 Schenk, C (1998), ‘The Origins of the Eurodollar Market in London:  1955 – 1963’, Explorations in Economic History, Vol. 35, Issue 2, pages 221-38;  McGuire, P (2004), ‘A Shift in London’s Eurodollar market’, BIS Quarterly Review, September 2004;  Hughes and MacDonald (2002) ibid.

The Drivers of the New Finance a)  The New UK Economy The economy is reorganising into a series of distributed peer-to-peer connections across powerful networks – revolutionising how people consume, work and communicate. The nature of commerce is changing.  Sales are increasingly taking place on-line and over platforms, rather than on the high street.  Intangible capital is now more important than physical capital.8  Data is the new oil. We are entering an age when anyone can produce anything anywhere through 3-D printing, where anyone can broadcast their performance globally via YouTube or sell to China whatever the size of their business via Tmall. In a hyper-connected, capital-light world, the future may increasingly belong to small and medium-sized firms, with platforms (such as taskrabbit, Amazon, Etsy, Shopify, and SamaHub) giving them direct stakes in local and global markets. The financial implications of these developments are only beginning to be realised, but they are likely to be immense.  In anticipation, the Bank is already creating the new hard and soft infrastructure that the new finance will require. For example, the Bank of England is in the midst of an ambitious rebuild of the Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system – the backbone of every payment in the UK. There are three ways the Bank’s new RTGS will provide a platform for private innovation.  Each will make it easier for people to plug in and pay, even across borders. First, RTGS is being re-built so that new private payment systems, including those using distributed ledger, can simply plug into our system.  Our new, hard infrastructure will be future-proofed to your imaginations, opening up a range of potential innovations in wholesale markets, and corporate banking and retail services. We have just opened up direct access to RTGS to a new generation of non-bank payment service providers (PSPs).  No longer will access to central bank money be the exclusive preserve of banks. Several non-bank PSPs, focused on retail and corporate services, are applying currently.  The electronic money flowing through their systems will become more like its physical relative.  Electronic payments are becoming instantaneous by using QR codes or mobile phone numbers.  Checkout can be eliminated.  The customer, not cash, will reign supreme.                                                                  8 In the UK, intangible investment rose above tangible investment in the early 2000s, and stood at 11% as a share of output in 2014 compared with 10% for tangible investment.  Investment in intangibles also exceeded that in tangibles in the US, Sweden and Finland [on average over 1999-2003], but not in other European countries including German, Italy and Spain.  See Haskel, J and Westlake, W (2017), ‘Capitalism Without Capital:  The Rise of the Intangible Economy’, Princeton University Press;  and Goodridge, P R, Haskel, J and Wallis, G (2016), ‘Accounting for the UK Productivity Puzzle:  A Decomposition and Predictions’, Economica, Vol. 85, Issue 339. 
    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 6  6   Second, RTGS is being re-configured to lower the excessive costs of cross-border payments.  To this end, two private PSPs joined earlier this year.9  In parallel, the Bank is working to connect RTGS and the systems run by other central banks.  And we have just begun collaborating with the Bank of Canada, the Monetary Authority of Singapore and several private-sector firms to improve inter-bank cross-border payments, including initiatives based on distributed ledger. The potential returns are large.  At present, cross-border payments can cost ten times more than domestic ones.10  We estimate that in the UK alone there is scope to realise annual savings of over £600 million.  Most fundamentally, the more seamless are global and domestic payments, the more UK households and businesses will benefit from the new global economy.  Third, as we overhaul RTGS, the Bank is making it easier for the UK financial system to realise the promise of big data. The new RTGS will capture much richer data on every payment made in a format that defines international best practice.  The Bank is currently consulting on how to do this, including on the desirability of embedding the best corporate identifier, the Legal Entity Identifier (or LEI), in RTGS and all the UK’s main payment systems.11  This will improve access to the domestic and global financial system, support greater choice and competition for corporate end-users, and advance anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism efforts.   The Bank is also ensuring our rules and regulations – or soft infrastructure – are fit for the new finance. We have streamlined our approach to authorising banks to make it easier for banks with innovative business models to be approved.  Since 2013, 37 banks have been authorised, of which 16 are new UK bank start-ups and four are internet-only. With the FCA we’re are exploring how artificial intelligence and machine learning could be used to make the reading of our rulebooks easier, the reporting of regulatory data quicker and the analysis of that data more efficient. And the Bank is thinking through how regulation may need to change with the investment needs of the new economy, including new approaches to risk models and secured lending in a world of intangible capital and data-based finance.                                                                  9 In April 2018:  https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2018/april/non-bank-psp-access-to-the-payments-system-announcement.  10 McKinsey World Payments Map (2016). 11 The G20’s LEI, which originated as a risk management tool for the financial sector, standardises identities for companies.

Over the past quarter century, emerging economies’ share of global activity has risen from 40% to 60% and their share of global trade from one fifth to one third.  Yet at present, their financial assets make up only 10% of the global financial system. This will quickly change.  As emerging market economies continue to open up, their share of global financial assets could treble to around a third by 2030. Maintaining the UK’s share of cross-border capital flows during this process could plausibly increase the balance sheet of our financial sector we host from the current 10 to 15 times GDP by 2030.  This will significantly boost UK prosperity – provided the associated risks of such an open system are managed responsibly. Responsible openness rests on three pillars. The first is strong global standards.  The UK has been at the forefront of G20 reforms to create a global financial system that is safer, simpler and fairer.  Implementation is now being regularly assessed and transparently reported by the FSB and the IMF. This second pillar is deep supervisory cooperation.  To manage cross-border challenges to financial stability, international authorities must share relevant information and work together.  As the home to four, and host to the other 26, globally systemically important banks, the Bank of England participates actively in all major supervisory colleges, sharing information and expertise gained from overseeing the multitude of complex risks unique to London.  We expect the same from those whose firms operate and take on large risks here.  The PRA’s open, cooperative approach to supervision means wholesale activity in London can remain globally-integrated and highly efficient, without compromising resilience.12   The third pillar of responsible openness is ending ”too big to fail”.  With enhanced resolution powers and planning, the Bank of England now has the ability to resolve failing banks.  The UK’s major banks are on track to complete this year the ring-fencing of their critical domestic high-street businesses from their riskier wholesale activities.  And they already hold loss absorbing resources of 25% of their risk-weighted assets against a 2022 requirement of 29%.  As a consequence of this progress, market discipline is returning, with the public subsidy enjoyed by the largest banks having fallen by 90%. Now is the time to reap the benefits of these enormous efforts.  Platforms are being created for deference to each other’s approaches when they achieve similar outcomes.  With the three pillars in place, an open, resilient global financial system is possible.                                                                   12 See the Bank of England’s Policy Statement 3/18, ‘International banks: the Prudential Regulation Authority’s approach to branch authorisation and supervision’. 
    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 8  8   The pillars underpin the government’s new Global Financial Partnerships Strategy.  The Bank of England will be particularly engaged in deepening our supervisory cooperation with major emerging economies and will continue to develop the infrastructure to support cross-border capital flows in their currencies. With respect to the European Union, the Bank remains of the view that an ambitious future financial services relationship, founded on commitments to achieving equivalent outcomes and supervisory cooperation, remains both feasible and in the interests of the UK, Europe and the world. The future economic and security partnership with the EU is for the government to negotiate and Parliament to approve.  The Bank’s role is to manage risks associated with the Brexit process and to provide technical support to the government as needed.   In this context, HM Treasury and the Bank are aligned on the importance of maintaining the high regulatory standards required by the world’s most important and complex international financial centre.  And we are both committed to responsible openness because it allows capital to move freely, efficiently and sustainably between jurisdictions and that supports trade, investment and jobs in the UK, Europe and the rest of the world. More broadly, building on the progress already made, financial services could serve as a template for broader services trade liberalisation.  Taking this high road could help solve the problem of persistent trade imbalances.  Bank of England research suggests that reducing restrictions on services trade, to the same extent as those on goods have been lowered over the past couple of decades, could reduce excess global imbalances by close to one half. Global partnerships also mean taking care of the global commons.  In Paris in 2015, 195 global leaders committed to curbing carbon emissions to limit the rise in global average temperatures to 2 degrees, and now many governments, including the UK with its new Clean Growth Strategy, are taking the necessary policy actions. In response, the private sector is recognising that financing the transition to a low carbon economy will be a major opportunity.  On some estimates, this transition could require investments in infrastructure, equivalent to $6 trillion per year through to 2030. Investment on this scale cannot be financed in niche markets.  It must be mainstream and global.  The City is showing the way by driving better disclosure of climate-related risks and opportunities and leading the underwriting of green bonds. The City is showing the way.  UK firms, including all of the largest banks, are driving better disclosure of climate-related financial risks and opportunities.  They join global financial institutions responsible for managing US$80 trillion of assets – equivalent to annual global GDP – that are now publicly supporting the 
    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 9  9   G20’s Task Force for Climate-related Disclosures (TCFD).13  And the City is leading the underwriting of local currency green bonds, where annual issuance could range in the hundreds of billions of dollars. For its part, the Bank of England has helped catalyse the private sector’s TCFD.  We are working closely with the People’s Bank of China to build domestic and cross-border markets to finance the transition to a low carbon economy.  And we are coordinating with fellow central banks and supervisors representing more than a third of global output and emissions to develop supervisory approaches to ensure the financial system is fit for the transition. c)  The New Demographics As the world is changing it is ageing. The ratio of the population aged over 65 to those of working age in advanced economies has increased from 15% in 1950 to 30% in 2015, and is projected to rise to 50% over the next twenty years.  Over the same period, this ratio is projected to double to over 25% in emerging markets. The macroeconomic consequences of these shifts are already evident, with the large, rapidly growing pool of retirement savings depressing interest rates and pushing up asset prices.14 The need to manage this growing pool of savings will drive further growth in the wealth management, insurance and pension industries.  And it will require new products, for example to meet the unpredictable costs of long-term care. In the process, market-based finance, which has already accounted for almost all corporate credit growth since the crisis, will become even more important. Seizing the full potential of market-based finance requires the right soft and hard infrastructure for continually open markets.  Hard infrastructure like resilient CCPs.  Soft infrastructure like the regulation the liquidity management of funds that offer daily liquidity while investing in highly illiquid underlying assets.   In particular, it requires hard infrastructure like a robust Bank of England balance sheet that can support the banking system and the broader system of market-based finance. The Bank’s new approach can be summarised in four words:  we’re open for business.  We now provide liquidity against a wider range of collateral, to a wider range of counterparties, for longer terms, and at lower fees than ever before.  And we stand ready to provide liquidity in a range of foreign currencies if required.                                                                  13 The financial sector supporters included 20 globally-systemic banks, 8 of the top 10 global asset managers, the world’s leading pension funds and insurers, the largest sovereign wealth fund and the two dominant shareholder advisory service companies. 14 See ‘[De]Globalisation and Inflation’, 2017 IMF Michel Camdessus Central Banking Lecture given by Mark Carney, and Rachel, L and Smith, T (2015), ‘Secular drivers of the global real interest rate’, Bank of England Working Paper No. 571.

    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 10  10   This new approach was tested during the EU referendum.  It passed.  With hundreds of billions of pounds of pre-positioned collateral and regular, flexible and widely accessible Bank of England liquidity auctions, markets stayed open and price discovery was smooth and effective.15 Today marks a step change in our ability to provide the liquidity that the new finance may eventually require. With the Chancellor’s announcement tonight of a ground-breaking new financial arrangement and capital injection for the Bank of England, we now have a balance sheet fit for purpose and the future.16  One that reflects the Bank’s much wider range of responsibilities including banking supervision, macro-prudential policy and resolution.  And the framework enhances our independence, transparency and accountability. The additional capital will significantly increase the amount of liquidity the Bank can provide through collateralised, market-wide facilities without needing an indemnity from HM Treasury to more than half a trillion pounds.17  This lending capacity would expand to over three quarters of a trillion pounds when, as designed, additional capital above the target level is accrued through retained earnings. The new framework will also strengthen the Bank’s ability to fulfil its monetary stability remit. In August 2016, the MPC launched the Term Funding Scheme (TFS) in order to reinforce the pass-through of the cut in Bank Rate to 0.25% to the borrowing rates faced by households and companies.  The Bank required an indemnity from HM Treasury for the loans it extended under the TFS.18 Today’s announcement increases the amount of risk the Bank can carry on its balance sheet.  As a result, the Bank plans to bring the £127 billion of lending extended through the TFS onto our balance sheet by the end of 2018/19 the financial year.  The additional capital means the MPC could, if necessary, re-launch the TFS in future on the Bank’s balance sheet, cementing 0% as the lower bound. Bringing the TFS onto the Bank’s balance sheet next year will mark the first step in winding down the Bank’s Asset Purchase Facility (APF).  After the TFS has been transferred, the APF will fall to £445 billion – the value of the government and corporate bonds purchased by the MPC as part of its Quantitative Easing programme. The MPC updated its guidance today on unwinding its asset purchases.  Previously, the Committee had noted that it would not begin reducing the stock of assets until Bank Rate had reached around 2%.  That reflected the MPC’s preference to use Bank Rate as the primary instrument for monetary policy and its                                                                  15 In the run-up to the vote, the Bank undertook extensive contingency planning which included encouraging banks to pre-position enough collateral in our facilities to enable them to draw down up to £250 billion in liquidity.  The combination of this war chest and coordinated G7 central bank action helped ensure markets functioned normally as the system absorbed a result that had been assigned a 10% probability hours before.  And it meant we could credibly communicate to the public that we were well prepared for the result. 16 See https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/letter/2018/banks-financial-framework-june-2018. 17 The exact amount that can be provided will depend on a range of factors, including the type and amount of collateral, the currency composition of the lending and the concentration to individual counterparties. 18 See https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/letter/2016/governor-apf-letter-040816.pdf. 
    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 11  11   desire to have sufficient scope to cut Bank Rate materially – relative to the effective lower bound on Bank Rate of 0.5% at that time – if necessary to respond to adverse shocks.19 Although the principles guiding the MPC’s choice of threshold still hold, with the lower bound on Bank Rate now permanently close to 0%, the MPC views that the level from which Bank Rate can be cut materially is now around 1.5%. Reflecting this, the MPC now intends not to reduce the stock of purchased assets until Bank Rate reaches around 1.5%. Any reductions in the stock of purchased assets will be conducted over a number of years at a gradual and predictable pace.  The MPC continues to view sales and reinvestment decisions as equivalent from a monetary policy perspective.  While any reduction will be solely a decision for the MPC based on meeting its objectives, the Bank will liaise with the Debt Management Office ahead of implementing any change in its asset purchase programme. As asset purchases unwind, decisions on Bank Rate will take into account any impact of changes in the stock of purchased assets on overall monetary conditions in order to achieve the inflation target.  In the event that potential movements in Bank Rate were judged insufficient to achieve the inflation target, the reduction in the stock of assets could be amended or reversed. The Bank is minded to continue to use a variant of the current floor system20 to control short-term interest rates as the stock of purchased assets is reduced, with the Bank meeting banks’ demand for central bank reserves in full at Bank Rate. The assets purchased by the MPC are currently indemnified by HM Treasury.  Once the APF has been unwound, the Bank will decide what assets to hold to back its liabilities. There is, for example, a strong case for holding some longer maturity assets, such as gilts, outright to back the stable portion of demand for banknotes.  Indeed the Bank had made this intention clear and already started to do this prior to the crisis.  The overall size and composition of the Bank’s balance sheet will be determined by private demand for reserves under the floor system, what is needed to support efficient market functioning and the financial arrangement between the Bank and HM Treasury under the Memorandum of Understanding published earlier today.  Over time, the Bank expects to learn more about the demand for reserves, and hence the likely size of its balance sheet in the medium term, including through engagement with market participants.                                                                  19 For more details, see the box on page 34 of the November 2015 Inflation Report. 20 See https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/markets/sterling-monetary-framework/red-book.pdf.

Even though there were threats of protectionism in the air, the UK had consistently positive agenda focused on openness and partnerships.    Global Financial Partnerships to take advantage of the enormous progress reforming the financial system over the past decade;  Free trade in services to address chronic trade imbalances, while promoting inclusive growth; and   Free trade for SMEs so that the many can take advantage of the new platforms, the new finance and the new economy. This eagerness reflects our confidence that the UK can seize enormous, new opportunities by building connections. The Bank recognises that a new economy, a new world and new demographics demand a new financial system. That’s why we are building the infrastructure so that UK households and businesses can transact anywhere, anytime with anyone whether around the corner or around the world.   That means connections between small businesses in Scunthorpe and their clients in Shanghai and between households in Belfast and firms in Bangalore. We now have a balance sheet fit for a new world order with greater reliance on markets in a wider range of reserve currencies. That means connections between banks, investors and markets around the world consistent with the City’s traditional global role. Having put in place the pillars of responsible, open financial system, we are ready for deeper Global Financial Partnerships with the emerging economies that will be the most important drivers of global growth in the decades ahead.   It is in this context of a confident, open and forward-looking City that the government’s discussions with Europe will take place. ------------------------------------------ 
    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 13  13   My Lord Mayor, this evening I have outlined the Bank’s priorities, but unlike a century ago, the Bank’s “policy” won’t be handed down to an unquestioning City.  The new finance will develop for the new economy, not in isolation from it.   Over the course of this year, Bank colleagues, led by Huw van Steenis, will explore these and other themes in roundtables, workshops and forums with a broad range of stakeholders up and down the UK.   While we prepare for great change, we will be guided by one constant: our mission to promote the good of the people we all serve.  
    23.05.2018 25th Financial Sector Meeting: Innovation, Transformation and Reputation Deloitte, Sociedad de Tasación and ABC Luis M. Linde Governor  

  3/6 Let me begin by thanking the organisers – Deloitte, Sociedad de Tasación and ABC – for their invitation to me to participate in this session of the 25th Financial Sector Meeting, which on this occasion turns on three ideas: innovation, transformation and reputation.   In my opinion, these three concepts accurately encapsulate the main challenges currently faced by the financial sector. The new technologies are enabling financial institutions to transform their systems and their business models, but this transformation should not lead us to forget that the keystone of any market, and all the more so financial markets, is customer confidence.     The financial sector is faced with a singularly complex setting and this conference provides an opportunity to confer with institutions’ key decision-makers on the different ways in which changes are being addressed at this time of transformation, which will be crucial for the future of the industry.   The new technologies, which have already significantly impacted various sectors, now have the potential also to substantially change the way in which financial services will be provided in the not-too-distant future. I would thus like to take this opportunity to offer my view on the opportunities and risks these new technologies pose. In this connection, I shall first briefly review the innovations I consider most significant and, secondly, I shall address the challenges posed by the new scenario for the authorities, and in particular for a central bank.   Financial market innovations   Any list of ongoing financial innovations inevitably highlights the weight of technology. The significance of the technological component in this new phase is such that it has ultimately lent its name to the process of change: Fintech. What is involved, however, is a broad and diffuse concept, which encompasses not only new highly technological firms, but any financial institution that is innovating through the application of new technologies. Occasionally, it is also used to describe new business models and even to refer to the basic technologies enabling the various innovations.   The confusion surrounding the Fintech concept is illustrative of the confusion deep-change processes can cause. In these circumstances, it is easy to be swept away by excessive enthusiasm or by unwarranted pessimism, two options with little value added. It is undoubtedly much more useful to focus on separating those innovations with the potential to improve efficiency in the provision of financial services, cutting costs and increasing security, and those seeking to adapt to the changes occurring in demand, from those spurious novelties that provide no significant improvements and which should be blocked as soon as possible. In other words, what is truly important should be separated from what is simply showy.   In this respect, cryptoassets or cryptotokens are one of the most striking developments in this area, going by the extensive media coverage some of them – such as the bitcoin – are receiving. But this does not mean that they are the most important or even the most promising innovation. Indeed, in my view, their current use poses more risks than benefits: they have a low level of acceptance as a means of payment, they are subject to extreme 
 4/6  volatility, they have numerous operating vulnerabilities and they have been related to fraudulent or illicit activities in many cases.   I shall not, however, give an exhaustive list of the risks of crypto assets, since the position of the Banco de España in this connection is well-known. But I will draw attention to how important it is to disassociate cryptoassets or tokens from their underlying distributed ledger technology.  Distributed ledger technology offers interesting possibilities insofar as it allows, in short, a ledger book to be shared securely among various agents. Although this technology is not yet sufficiently mature, it has the potential to generate efficiency gains and cost cuts in activities that require continuous reconciliations among various agents, either because such activities are relatively non-standardised, involve a high number of intermediaries or require complex processes. Areas such as securities trading and post-trading, international settlements, collateral management, trade finance and the management of digital identities might benefit from the use of this technology once it ultimately matures.   Also, the programming of smart contracts on a distributed network might add further gains in efficiency, by providing for the automation of processes. This is so, especially, in the case of complex contracts that give rise to multiple transactions distributed over time or conditional upon one another.   Other innovations receiving less media attention than cryptotokens nevertheless appear to be more mature and are, in practice, exerting a notable impact on the way in which financial institutions in general, and banks in particular, provide their services. I am referring specifically to big data, artificial intelligence and what is known as cloud computing.   Big data offer clear potential for enhancing and personalising the supply of financial services. True, financial institutions have for some time been using massive data processing techniques to enhance knowledge of their customers and to personalise their services. However, these possibilities have now been boosted thanks to the growing volume of information that is available in digital formats, cheaper storage costs and the increase in computing power.   The moves in big data are in fact boosting the development of other technologies that go beyond mere data processing. This is the case of artificial intelligence and automatic learning. They have numerous applications in the financial sector and are directed not only at end-products and customer relations, but are also transforming other financial services-provision facets, including banks’ in-house operations in areas such as risk management or regulatory compliance.  The use of virtual agents or virtual recognition is already contributing to enhancing users’ relationship with financial services-providers. But artificial intelligence and automatic learning can also be applied to tasks such as automatic information reconciliation, fraud detection, risk mitigation and regulatory compliance.   The final innovation I should like to mention in this brief review is cloud computing. In an environment in which data are configured as a strategic asset, this technique enables new 
  5/6 solutions to be offered with greater speed, cost efficiencies to be attained and business process adaptation to become more nimble. That said, this must all be done while maintaining an appropriate level of security, especially as far as critical areas are concerned.   A little historical perspective suffices to see the improvements that new technologies can bring to users. Credit and debit cards, ATMs and on-line banking are obvious examples of past innovations that have changed our day-to-day for the better. The success of these changes, however, has been closely bound up with the appropriate treatment of risks and the vulnerabilities that inevitably accompany these processes. The move to a more digital economy is accompanied by greater cyber threats, and new measures safeguarding processes, assets and customer data must be developed.   Along with paying particular attention to the management of these threats, it will also be essential to respond to the challenges stemming from the concentration of operational risk among a small number of critical service-providers, or those arising from customer protection. Financial services-providers must also meet the challenge of understanding in their full dimension the functioning and results of increasingly automated and autonomous algorithms and procedures.   Organisational changes to address the challenge of financial innovation   The role of regulators and supervisors is to contribute to harnessing in full the benefits of innovation while maintaining risks within reasonable and socially acceptable limits. As you can imagine, this is no easy task and requires the authorities themselves to undertake internal transformation processes so as to be able to appropriately meet these challenges.  As a result of this need, the Banco de España has in recent years assigned growing resources to monitoring and analysing financial innovation.   The first step was the creation, in February 2017, of an internal group with representatives from different business areas within our central bank to gain a cross-departmental view of the phenomenon and to promote coordination among these different areas.   One year on, we have deemed it necessary to take a further step, assigning specific resources to the analysis of financial innovation. To do this, a new Associate Directorate General was created last March.  This new area pursues three major aims: (i) to understand the dimension of the changes taking place, (ii) to analyse the consequences of the new developments, and (iii) to provide for coordination and contact with the market and the other authorities involved, including those from other jurisdictions since, in short, financial technological innovation is a global phenomenon. The ultimate aim is to develop an overview of the main features and challenges facing financial services-providers.   By way of conclusion, let me stress that, if duly harnessed and managed, the new technologies and the growing digitalisation of the financial sector may offer major opportunities for increasing efficiency and improving financial services as a whole.

Joachim Wuermeling: Brexit means Brexit - but what does it meanfor Europe as a financial centre?Speech by Prof Joachim Wuermeling, Member of the Executive Board of the DeutscheBundesbank, at the annual reception of the Association of Foreign Banks in Germany, Frankfurtam Main, 20 June 2018.*   *   *1 IntroductionLadies and gentlemenIt gives me great pleasure to be able to speak to you today about the future of Europe as afinancial centre after Brexit. There are three aspects which I would particularly like to address.The first of these is that banks looking to relocate their business to the EU or expand theirpresence here after Brexit will be asked to satisfy the same minimum prudential standardsthat foreign banks already operating within the Union and domestic institutions are expectedto comply with. At the same time, we will need to find solutions that prevent anyunnecessary additional expense.My second point is that in future, institutions that conduct cross-border business will beheavily dependent on how the respective supervisors oversee third-country institutions – asthey will then be – and how the authorities involved will cooperate internationally.And third, when considering Brexit, we tend to dwell on the negative side of things and thinkabout how best to cushion the impact. As important and justified as these considerationsare, we nonetheless need to continue to press ahead with our vision of a harmonisedfinancial market in the EU – a digital financial centre of Europe which offers as yet untappedpotential.2 Leaving the single market means separate supervisory regimesTwo years on from the Brexit vote, we can only assume that cross-border economicrelationships look set to face noticeable headwinds going forward. For the financial markets, thismeans one thing: the financial services passport is dead.This immediately raises the question: could it be feasible to have something like a diet version ofthe financial services passport, or to perhaps create a range of exceptions?The clear answer to this is that there cannot be, nor will there be, any permanent exceptions.Institutions that relocate operations to the EU or expand their presence here following Brexit willhave to comply with the same high supervisory standards that apply to the institutions thatalready operate here.This answer is underpinned by the fundamental belief that supervisors must be capable ofintervening in the business activities of institutions operating within their own jurisdiction at alltimes. This is a sine qua non, and it should not be up for grabs.At the same time, this credo should not prevent us from thinking about whether, and if so where,we can cushion any additional operational outlay caused by time pressure.A transitional period, at least as outlined in principle in March, could help with this. It would lowerthe long-term costs of exit by allowing firms to reflect on their options and decide which marketsthey want to operate in and which organisational structures would best allow them to strike theright balance between compliance and profitability. However, we cannot count on there being a 1 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
transitional period right now, since negotiations could break down at any time.3 Supervision of future third-country institutions: requirements and cooperationBut whether or not there is a transitional period, one thing is certain: what standards apply to thefuture third-country institutions will ultimately boil down to how they are treated by the relevantsupervisor after Brexit and how the authorities will work together in this context. To shed light onthis issue, the SSM has already adopted a whole bundle of supervisory policy stances.However, in the SSM, our baseline assumption is still the worst case, ie a no-deal scenario. Andjudging by recent developments in the United Kingdom, this seems more than appropriate.With the next meeting of EU heads of state or government fast approaching, it doesn’t look likesolutions to a number of quite fundamental issues concerning the future partnership will be foundany time soon. The border with Northern Ireland is just one of these sensitive topics. This meansthat a huge package of agreements would have to be hammered out at the next summit but onein October, which would then, in turn, have to be reviewed by the parliaments in the shortest oftimeframes. And even if this all went smoothly, it would be no more than a framework that wouldhave to be fleshed out in detail to forge a future treaty – which would itself take many years. Andbecause a breakdown in negotiations – and therefore a hard Brexit – remains possible at anytime throughout the entire process, enterprises should be prepared for this.That is why we banking supervisors are so concerned that a number of banks are easing off intheir efforts to establish a licensed and operational entity in the EU or UK in good time ahead ofMarch 2019. Let me say in no uncertain terms that these institutions cannot rely on our leniency.We expect all banks to make provisions for a hard Brexit. And that’s why I would strongly urge allinstitutions to make the necessary preparations to keep their business operations running even ifthere is a hard Brexit on 29 March 2019. Institutions that submit an application after the end of thecurrent quarter will find that the likelihood of their licensing procedure being concluded in time willdiminish considerably.We also expect these applications to satisfy our supervisory policy stances. Let us take a brieflook at the key aspects.First, there are the principles for authorisation and for governance, risk management andoutsourcing. In essence, the several hundred pages of requirements boil down to this:“empty shells” will not be permitted. Banks in the euro area must be able to manage all theirmaterial risks independently and locally. To achieve this, they need to have control over theirbooks and all their positions, and have locally independent governance and control functionsthat report to the local board of management – particularly in the areas of risk management,compliance and internal audit.That brings us to the question of booking models. Will back-to-back hedging still beaccepted? Here, the SSM expects banks in the euro area to have sufficient local capacity tomanage at least an evident portion of their euro-denominated business themselves and notto fully outsource it to other entities within the group. The local entities have to be establishedin the local market, to ensure that, in the event that other group entities fail, they canparticipate in the market autonomously. However, we at the Bundesbank naturally see theeconomic advantages of back-to-back hedging. To some extent, transactions such as theseserve as a pipeline to international capital resources at other locations.Some parties are hoping for an overarching supervisory or legal solution to the issue of thecontinuity of financial contracts. In response, I warn against relying on us for this, as it is notso much a supervisory issue as a civil law problem.One very important issue – and not just for foreign banks – is the supervision of future third-country CCPs from the UK. In the Bundesbank’s view, there have to be clear rules and 2 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
safeguards here ensuring that continental European authorities have both sufficient rights toobtain information and robust powers of intervention in respect of UK CCPs – otherwise, itseems a relocation to the EU would be all but unavoidable. The more we look at the whole issue, the more clearly we can see just how serious therepercussions will be when CCPs we consider to be systemically important leave ourjurisdiction. Volker Brühl from the Center for Financial Studies gave a systematic summaryof many aspects in a recent study on the topic. He set out and simulated with painstakingaccuracy the implications of problems at a third-country CCP for:monetary policy transmission in the euro area,the functioning of our resolution regime,having recourse to national central banks, especially the Bundesbank, as a lender oflast resort.These scenarios, over which I would have no supervisory influence whatsoever, fill me withincreasing unease. And if my colleague, Brian Bussey from US Commodity Futures Trading Commission(CFTC), stresses that a lead supervisor is crucial, but says the US has more interest in LCHthan anyone else in the world, then I think we are already back in third place. Given theCCP’s systemic importance for the euro area, this would be unacceptable. The ECON Committee of the European Parliament has recently taken an initial stanceregarding migration – and here, too, the possibility of relocation continues to play a majorrole. For us at the Bundesbank, this is not a matter of structural policy or trade issues. We arecompetitively minded and neutral. Our mandate is to safeguard price and financial stability,and these decisions affect this stability in a major way.These policy stances already stake out a clear, transparent framework of expectations in theSSM.4 The future of Europe as a financial centreLadies and gentlemen, as much as we greatly regret the United Kingdom’s decision to leave theEU, we must nonetheless look forward and consider how financial services can be delivered inthe European Union in the future.First, we need to observe the consequences of Brexit from the perspective of each individualbank. Banks have so far avoided making any major changes, not least because they are alsobusy coping with large-scale acute challenges and their financial implications. So it is easy tolose sight of strategic issues. It’s not just Brexit that’s shifting the tectonic plates under banking –digitalisation and regulation are two other key drivers of change. When traditional structures andmarkets are broken up this way, the cake will be redivided – some will lose out, but some will geta bigger slice. There is a real danger that adhering at all costs to traditional positions in London 3 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
risks missing out on new opportunities in the EU – though not by everybody: those who don’t willbe the winners. So I would urge you not to lose sight of medium and long-term strategic options.Second, we also have to consider the repercussions of Brexit in terms of its impact on the EUfinancial market as a whole. What we are looking at here is nothing less than the financing of theEuropean economy, especially at a time when the global economic and financial order isbecoming increasingly shaky. Earlier EU initiatives – the single financial market, the bankingunion, and the capital markets union – all had an inward focus. And with London, Europe had aninternational financial centre. This will now change. Hence the question of whether we in the EU27 should aspire to developing a globally competitive financial centre that is more than the sum ofits parts here in Frankfurt, Paris, Amsterdam or Dublin. François Villeroy de Galhau, the governorof the Banque de France, recently spoke of an integrated network with centres specialised invarious activities – and I am thinking along the same lines, which include major efforts to harnessdigital potential as well.I would like to help kick off a broad, forward-looking debate surrounding the concept of a digitalfinancial centre of Europe.It’s an idea based on three pillars.First, a networking pillar. Today, Europe’s financial services potential is spread over variouslocations. It does not have a cumulative effect. However, for a fully-fledged financial ecosystem totruly flourish, there needs to be enough providers and users of financial services in the localmarket. At present, no European financial centre can tick this box. The continental venues could,however, tap into an aggregate potential if they were to form a network in which any financialproduct can be bought and sold in any quantity at any time, just as you would expect from aglobally competitive financial centre.The second pillar is digitalisation. Financial centres in continental Europe need robust digitalmarket infrastructure that leverages all the state-of-the-art digital capabilities – of whichdistributed ledger technology (DLT) is but one. Only then can these centres overcomefragmentation and replicate agglomeration effects of physical proximity. The Eurosystem will alsobe expected to contribute here, seeing as it already provides a key piece of infrastructure forpayments in the shape of the TARGET system.These first two pillars create a digital network across European financial centres. But to makethe most of Europe’s potential as a “financial Amazon”, market-driven specialisation will also beneeded as a third pillar. Specialisation can help deliver economies of scale, increase the potentialfor innovation, and achieve excellence. In an environment of “coopetition” – a neologism mergingthe words cooperation and competition, European financial centres could cooperate, competeand, at the same time, hone their own areas of expertise. But this is a vision for the future.It’s a picture of the future that is also very much in our own inherent interest as a central bank,because the more that financial flows end up where our system is in force, the more we are ableto promote financial and price stability as well as a strong currency.5 ConclusionLadies and gentlemen, “Brexit means Brexit” – but at the end of the day, what this means for thefinancial centre of Europe is very much up to us.This goes for those of you who are domestic and foreign banks, for those of you who makepolicy at the regional, national and European level, and for us as central banks and supervisors.Now a change of perspective is in order: let’s see Brexit as an opportunity for us, not by naïvelywhitewashing what is a regrettable development, but by planning a sober yet forward-looking 4 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
model.Thank you for your attention. 5 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
William C Dudley: The transition to a robust reference rate regimeRemarks by Mr William C Dudley, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal ReserveBank of New York, at the Bank of England’s Markets Forum 2018, London, 24 May 2018.*   *   *Thank you, Mark, and thanks to the Bank of England for the opportunity to talk about the importantissue of reference rates.  I will focus my remarks today on reference rate reform in the UnitedStates—where we have been, where we are, and where we are headed.  In short, I will arguethat while much has already been accomplished, we still have a lot more to do—and it musthappen within a compressed time frame.  This is an important point that Andrew Bailey usefullyunderscored for us last year.  Because of the great uncertainty over LIBOR’s future and the risksto financial stability that would likely accompany a disorderly transition to alternative referencerates, we need aggressive action to move to a more durable and resilient benchmark regime.  Asalways, what I have to say reflects my own views and not those of the Federal Open MarketCommittee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.LIBOR Scandal Demonstrated the Imperative for ReformAlthough the backdrop to current reference rate reform efforts is well known here, somehistorical context is useful when considering the issues facing us today.  That history highlightswhy alternatives to LIBOR are needed.  It also illustrates the importance of continuing to focus onbank culture and proper incentives in order to support financial stability over the longer term. At its core, the problem we face today is that the financial system has built a tremendously largeedifice on a structurally impaired foundation.  While many in the industry cannot recall a timewhen LIBOR did not exist, in fact, it was only developed in the 1980s.  Since then, the use ofLIBOR as a reference rate has exploded—with the size of financial contracts referencing U.S.-dollar LIBOR today estimated at close to $200 trillion. The vast majority of these exposures arederivative obligations, such as interest rate swaps.  But, that tally also includes trillions of dollarsof cash products, such as residential and commercial mortgages, corporate bonds and loans,and securitized products.  And, with new contracts referencing LIBOR still being written, thisbalance continues to grow significantly. Broadly speaking, reference rates are vital to efficient market functioning.  They facilitate tradingin standardized contracts, which lowers transaction costs and increases market liquidity. Robust reference rates can also reduce information asymmetries and the risk of misconduct byproviding transparent, independent pricing. But, in the case of LIBOR, the foundation had serious flaws.  Most notably, LIBOR was (and is)based on submissions from individual banks—which, in turn, were based on hypotheticalborrowing rates or expert judgments, and not actual transactions.  Moreover, deficiencies existedin regulatory oversight and governance of the rate-setting mechanism.  These vulnerabilitiesenabled the manipulation of the rate for the financial benefit of individuals and institutions.  Amidprofound breakdowns in controls and compliance, individual traders conspired with ratesubmitters at their own institutions or traders at other firms to manipulate the setting of the rate toimprove their trading results.  During the global financial crisis, panel banks also reportedlysubmitted lower borrowing rates than they could actually obtain in the marketplace.  They did soto disguise their financial fragility at a time when uncertainty over bank liquidity and solvency washigh.  The resulting scandal was particularly disturbing because of its scale and flagrancy, includingcollusion by employees across firms.  It led to billions of dollars in fines, jail terms for someindividuals, and severe reputational damage to the financial industry as a whole.  The global123 1 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
financial crisis exposed excessive risk-taking and a long series of lapses in judgment, and theLIBOR scandal further undermined trust in the ethical standards of the banking industry. The scandal provides many cautionary lessons, including the ways in which poor technicaldesign can be exploited, the limitations of self-regulation, the problems that arise when loyalty isto one’s trading co-conspirators rather than to one’s institution, and the need for robust controls. It also underscores the power of incentives to drive individuals and firms to do things that areimprudent and/or unethical. And, the governance and control framework that the banks and theLIBOR administrator had in place proved woefully insufficient to prevent misconduct thatstemmed from poor incentives.  In this context, one could say it was a situation ripe forexploitation. The openness and brazenness of misconduct as captured in the recorded transcripts also pointto serious deficiencies in bank culture.  My New York Fed colleagues and I have commentedfrequently on the need for sound culture and incentives as a complement to effective regulationand supervision.  While there has been some progress on this issue in recent years, the LIBORand other rate-rigging scandals—not to mention more recent breakdowns at individual banks—point to the need for further strengthening of bank culture.   I look forward to the discussion withMinouche and Andrew on improving culture in the fixed income, currency, and commoditymarkets in the following panel. One of the key lessons from the financial crisis was that critical pieces of financial systeminfrastructure must be both strong and resilient, and the LIBOR scandal underscored this need.  The essential problem with LIBOR is the inherent fragility of its “inverted pyramid,” where thepricing of hundreds of trillions of dollars of financial instruments rests on the expert judgment ofrelatively few individuals, informed by a very small base of unsecured interbank transactions. Moreover, that base has contracted further in recent years, due to many factors, includingregulatory reform and the quantitative easing programs initiated by central banks in many of themajor advanced economies.  Relative to the vast sums of U.S.-dollar LIBOR contracts Imentioned earlier, the median daily volume of unsecured three-month U.S.-dollar wholesaleborrowing is minuscule, at around $1 billion, and many days see less than $500 million involume.   This lack of market liquidity means that these rates cannot be sufficiently transaction-based to be truly representative, and rates that are not transaction-based are more at risk to bemanipulated. So, despite efforts to improve LIBOR in recent years—and there undoubtedly have beenimportant changes that have strengthened its administration and governance—the lack ofunderlying market liquidity for nearly all currencies and maturities remains a problem, and thereis no obvious solution.   The setting of LIBOR still depends heavily on expert judgment.  Even forU.S.-dollar LIBOR, actual transactions are the basis for only about one-third of the ratesubmissions for tenors of one and three months.  This is noteworthy because these are thematurities that are referenced by the bulk of financial contracts.In light of the history of LIBOR—and in the context of more than $320 billion in overall misconductfines since the crisis—banks are naturally reluctant to assume the legal risks associated withsubmitting quotes based on very shallow markets.   Indeed, that is why some banks have leftindividual LIBOR panels in recent years.   Andrew Bailey drove home this point in his July 2017speech.  He explained that the Financial Conduct Authority had to press hard to persuade banksto remain on the panels and voluntarily submit LIBOR quotes through the end of 2021.  LIBOR’s potential cessation after 2021 poses a clear risk to financial stability, and prudent riskmanagement means that all of us must prepare for a world without LIBOR. The Official Sector ResponseIn recent years, international and domestic authorities alike have actively worked with the private456789101112 2 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
sector to address LIBOR’s shortcomings and to find alternative rates.  One notable developmenthas been the publication of an international set of principles for financial benchmarks, developedby the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) in 2013.   Theseprinciples—which include 19 specific standards across governance, benchmark quality,methodology, and accountability—have emerged as the international standard.  IOSCO hasrightly focused on tying benchmarks more closely to observable, arms-length transactions. Thisrepresents an important step toward eliminating excessive reliance on expert judgment.The Financial Stability Board (FSB) has been a galvanizing force at the international level.  TheFSB and its members have published proposals, plans, and timelines for reference rate reformand have promoted the strengthening of the major interest rate benchmarks.  The FSB has beencarrying out work on the development and introduction of alternative benchmarks, developing aplan to accomplish a transition to new benchmarks, encouraging work by the private sector oncontract robustness, and reporting regularly on the progress made.  The Federal Reserve has played a lead role in the development of these recommendations asapplied to U.S.-dollar LIBOR, working closely with the other major financial regulatory agencies inthe United States.  This effort has also involved coordinating with the official sector sponsors ofsimilar efforts around the world.   In late 2014, in response to FSB and Financial StabilityOversight Council recommendations, the Federal Reserve convened the Alternative ReferenceRates Committee (ARRC)—a group of market participants established to identify more robustalternative U.S.-dollar reference rates that are risk-free or nearly risk-free, fit the needs of thederivatives market, and are compliant with IOSCO principles.   This effort paralleled similarones in other jurisdictions to find reference rates that are well-suited to local conditions andmarket needs—including the UK’s Working Group on Sterling Risk-Free Reference Rates.  TheARRC was also tasked with developing a transition plan to facilitate the adoption of these rates ina voluntary and orderly manner, and with considering best practices in contract design to preparefor the possibility that LIBOR ceases to be published. Publication of Alternative Reference Rates by the Federal ReserveThe ARRC has made important progress in achieving its mandate.  Notably, in June 2017, itselected the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, as its preferred alternative to U.S.-dollar LIBOR.  SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight using U.S.Treasury securities as collateral, and is thus relevant to a wide range of market participants.  Therate is entirely transaction-based, and the underlying market is robust, with current daily volumeof more than $700 billion.  (By comparison, unsecured three-month U.S.-dollar wholesaleborrowing totals roughly $1 billion per day, as I mentioned earlier.)  SOFR moves closely withLIBOR and other money market rates over time, and because it covers multiple segments of therepo market, it provides scope for future market evolution.   Besides being more resistant tomanipulation, this nearly risk-free rate should also prove much more resilient during periods offinancial stress, because the U.S. Treasury repo market is likely to remain deep and activeduring such episodes. The New York Fed administers and produces SOFR in cooperation with the Office of FinancialResearch.  We began publishing this rate on April 3 of this year, along with two other repo rates:the Tri-Party General Collateral Rate and the Broad General Collateral Rate.   This workcomplements steps by the Federal Reserve to promote greater transparency in rates inunsecured markets through enhancements to the calculation of the effective federal funds rate(EFFR) and the launching of an entirely new rate, the overnight bank funding rate (OBFR).  I have long been a proponent of the idea that central banks are well suited to take on thisresponsibility.  Reference rates have strong public good properties, and the private sector facesnotable coordination challenges in this area.  Central banks have a long history in producing suchmeasures—recognizing that traditionally this has been for purposes related to monetary policy—13141516171819 3 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
and are trusted independent parties.  In my view, central banks also ultimately “own” the financialstability risks that are present when key reference rates are flawed.  Better to recognize thisresponsibility and move proactively to mitigate such risks than to step aside and hope thatsomeone else will take up the mantle of reform. The Federal Reserve has designed these benchmarks to be compliant with IOSCO principles,with regular review by oversight bodies and comprehensive ethics and conflict-of-interest policiesfor staff.   Best practice also dictates that administrators periodically review the rates theyproduce to assess whether changes in the underlying markets require changes in how thoserates are administered.  We have dedicated significant resources to these efforts, and arecommitted to the continued production of rates so that market participants can have confidenceabout their long-term viability. For these reasons, the Federal Reserve concurs with the ARRC that SOFR represents acompelling alternative to U.S.-dollar LIBOR—particularly for most derivatives transactions, wherea near risk-free rate is more appropriate than a rate that incorporates a bank credit riskpremium. Nevertheless, market adoption of SOFR faces its own challenges, such as the development ofsufficient liquidity in derivatives that reference SOFR, and the establishment of a term referencerate, which I will discuss in a moment.  These elements will have to be built over time.  TheARRC’s Paced Transition Plan lays out a timeline for the milestones that must reached over thecoming quarters and years for a successful transition.   I am confident that the ARRC willsucceed, but it will take considerable attention and effort.Progress is already evident.  The Chicago Mercantile Exchange began offering SOFR futurescontracts earlier this month, and trading activity has gotten off to a good start.  Development ofSOFR derivatives, in turn, will support the creation of a term reference rate.  Although theARRC’s transition plan anticipates that this will be completed by the end of 2021, it would bebetter for this to occur more expeditiously.  The good news is that is broadly appreciated.  In thisvein, the Committee’s second report discussed some of the term rate alternatives, anddevelopment of proposals for a term reference rate was recently added to its mandate.  In thisregard, I would also encourage market participants, academics, and other interested parties tocontribute to the effort to develop a term reference rate.Another key area of focus—further motivated by Andrew’s warning—is the development offallback contract language in the event that LIBOR ceases to be published.  The absence of suchlanguage creates the potential for large-scale disorder in global financial markets should LIBORgo away.  Put simply, this is an unacceptable risk.  The International Swap Dealers Association(ISDA) has been working on this issue for the derivatives market and is expected to issue aconsultative document soon that should prove instrumental in making further progress.  TheARRC has also been coordinating a similar effort across cash products of all types.  The goal isto achieve consensus on a consistent approach across markets whenever feasible. Looking AheadAs I have noted previously, LIBOR continues to have significant shortcomings despitestrengthened governance in recent years, and uncertainty about its future will only grow overtime.  This uncertainty reflects the limited liquidity underlying LIBOR and the corresponding legalrisks I discussed earlier.  But, I am also skeptical about whether LIBOR can ever be adequatelytransaction-based.  As Andrew highlighted, there is no guarantee that LIBOR will continue to existbeyond December 2021.  In my view, LIBOR is likely to go away—and it should, because it is notsupported by a sufficiently robust regime.  The LIBOR countdown clock should provide animpetus for action, but it should also make market participants and regulators increasinglynervous as we approach the deadline—especially if longer-term solutions are not in train or in2021 4 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
place.  Time is of the essence, and we must manage it well.  The ARRC and others have laid outvaluable transition plans, and we need to ensure that they are executed expeditiously and well. Of course, I do not mean to minimize the costs involved.  This is a monumental and complicatedeffort—one that the industry has never undertaken—and it will entail overcoming manyobstacles.  It requires collective action by a wide variety of market participants, some of whommay not be fully convinced of the need for change.  And, there may be others with a directinterest in the preservation of LIBOR—such as its administrator—who may not support movingaway from the status quo.  There also undoubtedly will be those who seek a free ride on theefforts of others.  And, of course, the effort will encounter inertia and wishful thinking.  All of this isto be expected in such a large undertaking with significant upfront costs.  Nevertheless, delay isnot a viable option. This task is borne out of necessity.  Financial crises typically result when we fail to identifyvulnerabilities, and then unexpected triggers turn those vulnerabilities into points of weaknessthat can lead to catastrophic failure.  The discontinuation of LIBOR, however, is different.  Wecan see it coming, and we know the impact of a disorderly transition would be huge.  Therefore,a half-hearted effort or a failure to act would be inexcusable, especially after all we have learnedfrom the experience of the financial crisis.  Moving this core piece of the global financial systemto a firm and durable foundation is essential and worth the cost. This task is admittedly hard, but I am optimistic given our past successes.  We havedemonstrated that effective collective action can provide solutions to longstanding structuralvulnerabilities in the financial system.  A key lesson from the crisis is that structural vulnerabilitiesmust be addressed continually.  If they are ignored, larger problems eventually will result.  Forexample, through collective action over the past decade, we have successfully addressedstructural weaknesses in the tri-party repo market, the over-the-counter derivatives market, andmoney market mutual funds. Each of these challenges required a tailored solution that relied on different tools—including adiverse mix of market, regulatory and supervisory measures—to get the job done.  Everythingisn’t a nail, and the best tool is not always a hammer.  You have to identify the problem thatneeds fixing and select the right tool for the job.  This is likely to require both official sectorengagement and private sector initiative. In the case of LIBOR, the official sector has taken a multi-pronged approach: strengthening theLIBOR regime, developing reference rate principles, using its convening authority to marshalprivate sector participation, supplying robust alternative reference rates, and using the bully pulpitto educate and spur action.  International coordination has featured strongly in these efforts, andshould continue to do so.  This approach has achieved a great deal to date, but, in light of therisks and potential implications, will it be sufficient? The transition away from LIBOR represents a significant risk event for firms of all sizes, and theyshould actively manage this transition through their existing frameworks for identification,management, and mitigation of risk.  Supervisors should continue to support this objective byensuring that all firms are aware of the transition and that LIBOR-related issues are beingaddressed in a way that is commensurate with a firm’s exposures and risks.  More broadly, theofficial sector will continue to push market participants to take all necessary steps to mitigate therisks to financial stability from a disorderly transition. In closing, the LIBOR scandal certainly was one low point among many during the financial crisisand its aftermath.  It highlighted the need for reform of a critical area of the global financialsystem.  We have made considerable progress since then, but reform still has a long way to go. The remaining work, by necessity, will involve purposeful collective action and engagementacross the financial industry to address market-wide issues.  It also will require firm-specificaction to manage individual risks.  The challenge is that the window for action is narrowing.  5 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches

The basis of the strategy is that the Riksbank shall strive towards an annual change of 2 per cent in the consumer price index with a fixed interest rate (CPIF). Given that there is confidence in the inflation target, monetary policy shall also support good growth in output and employment. The Riksbank therefore conducts what is generally referred to as flexible inflation targeting.  This is the basic framework for monetary policy. Within this framework, the Riksbank must cope with the fact that the economy and the way it works change over time. My intention here today is to discuss some of the challenges facing monetary policy and economic policy in general as a result of changes that have occurred over the last decade. In brief, it is a question of surprisingly subdued wage increases, the apparent difficulty in reducing unemployment further via expansionary policy alone, and the apparent deterioration in matching on the labour market. I intend to discuss this with the help of a simple survey, in which I look at how five key variables covary. The time period I’m studying is 2007–2018 and I’m using monthly data. The five key variables are:  • inflation, measured as the CPIF, the target variable for monetary policy • wage increases, according to short-term wage statistics from the National Institute of Economic Research (NIER) • unemployment, according to the Labour Force Surveys (LFS) • job openings, according to statistics from the Swedish Public Employment Service (Arbetsförmedlingen) on remaining job openings                                                            ∗ I would especially like to thank Mikael Apel and Emelie Theobald for their help with this speech. Meredith Beechey, Charlotta Edler, Jesper Hansson, Ann-Leena Mikiver, Åsa Olli Segendorf, Cecilia Roos-Isaksson and Ulf Söderström have all submitted valuable comments. 
       2 [16]  • the krona exchange rate, according to the trade-weighted KIX index. In order to focus on the trends in these five variables, I remove seasonal variations and general noise in the series by using moving averages over twelve months throughout. We will follow the time series for these variables two at a time. By doing so, we can see the covariation between inflation and unemployment, for example.  Looking at data is a good place to start It is important to understand that covariation between two variables does not necessarily mean that there is a causal relationship, a causality, between them. Instead, the covariation may, for example, depend on a third variable that is not shown. A classic example is the strong correlation between sleeping with your shoes on and waking up with a headache. But this presumably does not imply that the shoes cause the headache. There is instead an underlying variable explaining why a person both sleeps with their shoes on and wakes up with a headache. We should also be aware that when plotting two variables against each other, it is very rare to expect to find a clear-cut correlation of the type we see in textbook illustrations. The reason is, of course, that the variables are not just linked to each other but are also constantly influenced by a number of other factors. For example, inflation can be affected by changes in energy prices that do not have any significant impact on unemployment. Unemployment can, in turn, be affected by reforms on the labour market, for example, which do not have any significant effect on inflation, at least not immediately. In other words, we cannot expect to see an exact relationship but often have to be content with just barely being able to detect one.  On the other hand, the absence of a correlation that is visible to the eye does not mean that there isn’t one. It may still be there and be detectable only if we control for variables other than just the two we are studying. To gain a better understanding of what happens behind the scenes, therefore, we often have to delve deeper into the data, consider more variables and use more sophisticated analytical methods than “eyeball econometrics”. But studying exactly what the data looks like is always a good starting-point. So let’s now look at the figures! The Phillips curve – central but controversial Allow me to begin with the correlation that is normally called “the Phillips curve”. The name comes from the New Zealand economist, William Phillips, who, in an article in 1958, showed that there was a negative correlation between unemployment and wage increases in British data for the period 1861–1957. High unemployment tended therefore to be associated with low wage increases and vice versa, as in Figure 1. When many people compete for jobs, demand for higher wage increases falls while a shortage of labour leads to greater wage increases.    
       3 [16]  Figure 1. The Phillips curve  Subsequently, the Phillips curve concept was broadened to accommodate slightly different, though similar, correlations. In 1960, two American economists, Paul Samuelson and Robert Solow, both awarded the Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, reformulated the curve in terms of unemployment and inflation rather than unemployment and wage increases. As there is a close relationship between unemployment and output, the Phillips curve was also often formulated in terms of the correlation between inflation and output – or, as it is commonly expressed nowadays, resource utilisation. But it is basically the same thing we want to identify, namely a correlation between economic activity and the rate of increase in prices and wages. For a time, the Phillips curve was interpreted as economic policy-makers being able to choose a combination of inflation and unemployment. This was thought to be possible if the aim was a more permanent reduction in unemployment and there was a willingness to accept higher inflation in return.  But about ten years after the launch of the Phillips curve, Milton Friedman and Edmund Phelps, Nobel laureates in economics themselves, each lay the foundations for the so-called “expectations-augmented Phillips curve”. In brief, this implies that there is a short-term negative correlation between inflation and unemployment, but no long-term relationship. In other words, it is not possible to choose a certain combination of inflation and unemployment and then expect it to last. The reasoning behind this can be illustrated using Figure 2.    UnemploymentWage increase
       4 [16]   Figure 2. The expectations-augmented Phillips curve   The short-term correlation basically depends on the fact that higher inflation is often unexpected inflation. An expansionary policy can lead to lower unemployment and higher inflation; we move from A to B. But gradually, agents in the economy realise that inflation has risen and demand higher wage increases as compensation. In other words, the higher inflation is incorporated in the expectations and becomes the norm, and the higher wage increases cause unemployment to rise. The short-term correlation shifts upwards and we move from B to C. We are then back to the same unemployment as when we started, but with higher inflation. If the same thing were to be repeated, we would move in a similar way from C to D to E. Once again, unemployment is the same but inflation is higher. This unemployment is normally referred to as “equilibrium unemployment”.  A consequence is thus that an expansionary monetary policy cannot permanently create high employment and low unemployment. The long-run Phillips curve is therefore assumed to be vertical, as shown in the figure.  It’s good to keep this in mind, but I won’t discuss the long-run Phillips curve any more here. Instead, I will concentrate on the short-run Phillips curve, as it is an important piece of the puzzle for economic policy-makers, not least central banks. It is the link between demand in the economy, which central banks are assumed to be able to influence with their policy rates, and inflation.  Negatively sloped Phillips curve with inflation – but flat with wage increases So what does the correlation look like in Swedish data? As I mentioned in my introduction, I will look at data for the last decade. To make the figures clearer, I have marked the period 2007–2010 in blue and the period from 2011 in red.

       5 [16]  Figure 3. Inflation and unemployment Annual percentage change and as a share of the labour force  Note. Moving averages over 12 months. Sources: Statistics Sweden and the Riksbank As we see in Figure 3, there is a reasonably clear negative correlation during the whole period. The following additional observations can be made if we look a little closer: (i) During the period 2015–2017, inflation rose while unemployment fell.  (ii) Over the last six months, unemployment has fallen while inflation has remained on a level consistent with the inflation target. (iii) For a given level of unemployment, inflation has tended to be lower in recent years than it was during the period 2007–2010. As I noted, the original Phillips curve was formulated in terms of wage growth and not inflation. So what does such a curve look like for Sweden over the last decade? Seen over the entire period, the correlation also seems to be negative in Figure 4. But if we look at developments since 2011 in particular, there does not appear to be a correlation – The Phillips correlation seems to be more or less horizontal. Despite good economic developments especially in recent years, and many believe we are in the midst of an economic boom, wage growth has not increased.

       6 [16]   Figure 4. Wage increase and unemployment Annual percentage change and as a share of the labour force  Note. Moving averages over 12 months. Sources: Statistics Sweden, the Swedish National Mediation Office and the Riksbank First of all, we should remember here that we are, after all, talking about a rather short period of time. In other words, it is still slightly too early to draw the conclusion that some form of structural change has taken place on the labour market that will affect developments in the future. But obviously, it is nevertheless interesting to reflect on the causes of the development. It is also worth pointing out the fact that the unusually low wage growth, given the activity in the economy, is not a specifically Swedish phenomenon. The situation is much the same in most other industrialised countries and the underlying reasons are currently the subject of rather intensive discussion.1   A more flexible labour supply a possible explanation  In my view, an important overarching explanation is that the labour supply has probably become more flexible and elastic than previously. In other words, the supply curve on the labour market is flatter. This implies that greater resource utilisation does not necessarily lead to higher wage increases. When demand in the economy rises, it can be satisfied by labour being drafted into the production process, without much of a pressure to increase wages.   As I see it, there are primarily three probable causes behind the more flexible and elastic labour supply. The first is globalisation and increasing economic integration. Globalisation, and hence rising trade, increases labour supply in an indirect way. By this, I mean that products previously manufactured inside the                                                            1 See for instance Leduc and Wilson (2017). 12345123455.566.577.588.59Wage increaseUnemployment201120072018
       7 [16]  country by domestic labour can now often be manufactured abroad, often more cheaply, and then be imported. This implies that global labour supply affects domestic wage increases, especially regarding the less educated workforce.  Economic integration within the EU affects labour supply in a direct way as a result of the free movement of labour within the Union. Many utilise the opportunities provided by free movement – some by moving permanently, others by working temporarily in other countries within the Union. The other cause is technological development. The electronic revolution has made it possible to organise work in a different way than previously. For example, it has made teleworking much more possible. This occurs not only inside Sweden but also in the form of teleworking from other countries in organisations that are located in Sweden. Teleworking makes it possible to use the labour force more flexibly over the business cycle, so that the work can be part-time when economic activity is low and full-time when activity is high.  The third cause has to do with changes of institutions in a broad sense. A concrete Swedish example is that more and more collective agreements contain agreements on working time “banks”. According to these agreements, the number of hours worked for an employee can be redistributed over the business cycle. Another example is the emergence of temporary employment agencies in Sweden. From once upon a time being illegal, the industry is currently about 80,000 strong. In 2017, 250,000 were employed by the temporary employment industry in the areas of temporary staffing, career transition and direct recruitment.  In Sweden, we have also seen greater labour supply among older people. According to the LFS for the first quarter of 2018, almost four per cent of those employed were between 65 and 74 years old. One can assume that their labour supply is very flexible. If we add all these explanations together, it is perhaps not so strange that the correlation between resource utilisation and nominal wage increases seems to have weakened in recent years. Other explanations also feasible  But there are also other feasible explanations for the observation in Figure 4. One is that what is normally referred to as “structural unemployment”, the unemployment level in a situation with normal activity in the economy, has fallen.2 An overestimation of structural unemployment implies that there is more spare capacity in the economy than originally thought and it is thereby possible to stimulate demand more before wage growth kicks in.  The fact that structural unemployment cannot be observed and also varies over time obviously makes it difficult to verify the hypothesis. Purely theoretically, the observation that wage increases are unexpectedly low is well in line with an overestimation of structural unemployment.  Personally, I am a little sceptical                                                            2 For example, Bell and Blanchflower (2018) think this is the case in the United Kingdom. 
       8 [16]  about this hypothesis as far as Sweden is concerned. I will come back to this later on.  Another possible explanation for the low wage increases has to do with how inflation has developed after the financial crisis. For about six years, between 2011 and 2017, CPIF inflation was below and often well below target. It would not be particularly surprising if this has had a certain impact on what economic agents generally believe about inflation.  It is true that inflation expectations, as they are measured in surveys, indicate that economic agents are now once again expecting inflation to remain on target in the long term.  It also appears that employee organisations are increasingly seeing the inflation target as the basis for wage negotiations. At the same time, however, employers are claiming that the inflation target is no longer an obvious starting-point. According to the Swedish Association of Industrial Employers, it is instead competitiveness and wage outcomes in the euro area that constitute their benchmark.3 The implications of this are not obvious. Ultimately, the outcome depends on each respective party’s negotiating strength. But since wage increases in Germany, for example, have tended to be quite modest and since the industrial sector’s wage agreements in turn constitute a benchmark for other collective agreements in Sweden, it is conceivable that this could have contributed to the flat Phillips curve since 2011 in Figure 4. In the long term, however, this should not be a major problem as the euro area has an inflation target of “close to 2 per cent”, i.e. very close to our own target.  This should imply that wage increases will also be higher in the euro area going forward.  But tensions may arise periodically, of course. All in all, therefore, there are numerous feasible explanations for why wage increases have been relatively low despite good economic development. But so far we have no definitive answer to why it is like this nor to how permanent the phenomenon is.  Research on the Phillips curve ongoing  As I mentioned, the discussion about the Phillips curve is international to a high degree. Quite lively debate has been taking place in various countries recently centred on intensive estimation of Phillips curves, using slightly different specifications and different methods.4 This is what I mean when I say that we need more advanced methods than studying pairwise plots, in order to try to come to grips with what the correlation actual looks like.  In this context, it can be interesting to mention that a few fresh contributions to the debate originate from the School of Business here at Örebro University, where Sune Karlsson and Pär Österholm have estimated Phillips curves for the US and Sweden respectively in terms of inflation and unemployment. For Sweden during the period 1995–2017, the Phillips curve has, perhaps not so surprisingly, been found not to have been stable over time. It is also found that the Phillips curve,                                                            3 See, for example, Kinnwall and Rune (2018). 4 See for example Blanchard (2016), Cunliffe (2017) and Murphy (2018). 
       9 [16]  specified in this way, has not become flatter in recent years. The Phillips curve has also been found to have been unstable for the US. It appears to have been flatter in 2005–2013 but thereafter to have had a clearer negative slope.  It should be understood that economic research helps to improve our knowledge in that findings from many different quarters are thrashed out and hopefully eventually all point in a particular direction. Findings have so far varied a great deal. Off and on, the Phillips curve has been said to be dead, still alive but flatter than before or about the same as usual. My interpretation is that “the jury is still out” but that the most common finding in the studies performed seems to be that the correlation between the economic situation and inflation or wage increases has weakened, but is still there. Correlation between job openings and wage increases The number of people unemployed is a measure indicating an unsatisfied labour supply, i.e. the number of people who would like to have a job but have yet to obtain one. The unsatisfied labour demand, i.e. job openings that remain unfilled, can also be measured in a similar way.  The unsatisfied labour demand, or labour shortage as it is normally referred to, is normally measured in terms of job vacancies.  In the statistics, the discrepancy is made between job vacancies and job openings. The fact that an employer has a job opening means that the employer has started the external recruitment of an employee but has yet to employ someone. This is a wider concept than vacancy, which is defined as a “vacant, unstaffed job that can be taken up immediately”. The difference is that a job opening can be staffed, for example by a supply worker performing the work temporarily. But it can also be unstaffed without it necessarily being possible for someone to fill it immediately. One reason can be that the employer has planned well in advance and starts recruitment in good time before the needs become acute. As I noted in my introduction, the fact that I am pointing out these rather subtle and technical discrepancies is only because I have chosen to highlight various correlations over the past decade by using monthly data. In Swedish statistics, there are monthly data on job openings, while job vacancies are only reported quarterly. Even though it would be desirable in many ways to use vacancies, I therefore have to use job openings as an approximation. If we look at the data, it does not make much difference in this context, but it can still be good to know that I am simplifying a little here as job openings and job vacancies are not really the same thing. If we now view job openings as a measure of labour demand, we could see the relationship between job openings and wage increases as a kind of inverse Phillips curve. In the same way as the relationship between wage increases and unemployment can be expected to be negative, the correlation between wage increases and job openings should be positive.   
       10 [16]  Figure 5. Wage increase and job openings Annual percentage change and as a share of the labour force  Note. Moving averages over 12 months. Sources: Swedish National Mediation Office, Swedish Public Employment Service and the Riksbank Figure 5 indicates that this is not really the case during this period. Seen over the entire period, the correlation, if anything, is negative. If we look again at developments since 2011, the curve is almost horizontal, once again reflecting that wage increases have been low and stable. We have now looked at the correlations between wage increases and unemployment and between wage increases and the number of job openings. Let us complete the cycle and also study the third possible combination, that is, the correlation between the number of job openings and unemployment. The Beveridge curve shows how well the labour market is functioning   The correlation between job openings, or job vacancies to be exact, and unemployment is another well-known curve within economics. It is called the Beveridge curve and like the Phillips curve was developed in 1958. In contrast to the Phillips curve, however, William Beveridge was not the originator of the curve, but a British economist who gave his name to the curve as a result of his commitment to labour issues such as unemployment and skills matching. The Beveridge curve is a way of measuring how well the labour market is functioning. It is reasonable to assume that when demand in the economy is high, the number of job openings rises while unemployment falls, and vice versa. The correlation should therefore be negative. But it is above all the position on the Beveridge curve that is interesting. If there is a large number of job openings at the same time as unemployment is high, it suggest that those who are 123451234500.511.522.5Wage increaseJob openings201120072018
       11 [16]  unemployed cannot for some reason fill the openings. In other words, there are problems matching job-seekers to the job openings on the labour market, i.e. the labour market is not functioning particularly well. What then does the Beveridge curve look like in Swedish data over the last decade? As we see in Figure 6, the correlation is negative, exactly as expected. But we also see that the correlation from 2011 is higher than previously, i.e. for each given level of unemployment, there is a greater number of job openings. In other words, it seems as though matching on the Swedish labour market is now worse than it was before. Figure 6. Job openings and unemployment Annual percentage change and as a share of the labour force  Note. Moving averages over 12 months. Sources: Swedish Public Employment Service, Statistics Sweden and the Riksbank What overall conclusions can we therefore draw from these simple correlations I have presented? Well, if we look merely at the data, lower unemployment has not led to higher wage increases. It has, on the other hand, been associated with a rise in the number of job openings. It is not altogether easy to interpret this development. One interpretation could, however, be that companies after the financial crisis have, to a greater extent, been looking to recruit workers with different types of cutting-edge expertise. This is unfortunately a type of labour that is often difficult to find. This is also the impression I get when I have travelled around the country and talked to different companies. If higher wages are offered, it is for this type of labour, but this nevertheless does not appear to have prevented a shortage of labour from emerging in this segment of the labour market.  00.511.522.500.511.522.55.566.577.588.59Job openingsUnemployment201120072018
       12 [16]  On the increasingly dominant “traditional” labour market, however, labour shortage does not seem to have been such a major problem. There, a flexible labour supply has helped to restrain wage increases, in the way I described earlier. Why has inflation risen? The Phillips correlation measured in terms of inflation has been negatively sloped since 2011, while in terms of wage increases, it has been completely flat. How then has inflation risen despite wage increases not having done so?  Inflation rose steadily between 2014 and 2017, measured in terms of the CPIF, from around 0.5 per cent to a level consistent with the inflation target of 2 per cent. It is of course difficult to identify the exact impact of individual factors on inflation, but it is nevertheless possible to highlight some things that have played a part. One factor that affects the CPIF in rather a direct and straightforward way is changes in the international market prices for energy. Particularly in 2017, higher energy prices helped fuel CPIF inflation. Earlier in the period, the contribution from energy prices was instead negative.  Another factor, which is more difficult to capture and had an inhibitory effect for a long time, is international economic activity. In Sweden, resource utilisation has been rising for quite a long time, which should have made it easier for companies to raise their prices. At the same time, however, a weak and uncertain economic situation abroad has contributed to lower external price pressures. Recently, however, increasingly strong international economic activity has pushed inflation upwards in many countries. More inflation impulses from abroad should also have further improved the conditions for an inflation rate in line with the target. A factor that has probably also contributed to higher inflation is the rise in both short- and long-term inflation expectations, as they are measured in surveys, since 2015. Since the end of 2016, more long-term inflation expectations have been close to the inflation target of 2 per cent. Actual inflation obviously affects expectations, but the converse is also true. When confidence in the inflation target is strong, it becomes easier to reach the target, as price and wage formation are adapted to these expectations. The development of the exchange rate has also contributed to the upturn in inflation. In a simple theoretical framework, the change in price level, i.e. inflation, is affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate.5 But such a correlation is difficult to find. If we compare exchange rate fluctuations and inflation during the same period, the correlation is zero. However, the exchange rate influences inflation with a time lag. The correlation between inflation and exchange rate fluctuations twelve months previously is 0.19 in my data material. If we lag the exchange rate fluctuations a further twelve months, the correlation increases to 0.43. The maximum correlation (0.46) occurs when the time lag is 27 months. It now becomes clear that there is a positive correlation between exchange rate                                                            5 In models where prices are rigid, the inflation rate is instead affected by the level of the exchange rate, or by the real exchange rate’s deviation from its long-term value. 
       13 [16]  fluctuations and inflation, see Figure 7. When the krona weakens, i.e. when the KIX-index increases, inflation also rises. Figure 7. Inflation and exchange rate fluctuations, 27-month time lag Annual percentage change   Note. Moving averages over 12 months. Sources: Statistics Sweden and the Riksbank Of course, the correlation between the exchange rate and inflation is neither clear-cut nor straightforward. It depends, for example, on what has caused the exchange rate to fluctuate and how long it is expected to last.6 But the fact that there is a correlation, insofar as a weakening of the exchange rate tends to result in rising inflation and vice versa, is obvious. Finally, it should be emphasised that monetary policy has of course been important in this development. From the ongoing debate, the impression can sometimes be that monetary policy does not play such a major role and that economic activity had been just as strong and inflation had been on target regardless of the policy conducted by the Riksbank. This is of course not the case.  No causal relationship between wages and prices What then does the fact that inflation has risen but not wages actually signify? To begin with, and for the sake of completeness, we can also plot inflation against wage increases (see Figure 8). As we see, there is a tendency towards a positive correlation, at least periodically.                                                               6 See for instance the articles “The impact of the exchange rate on inflation” in the December 2016 Monetary Policy Report and “The exchange rate and inflation” in the April 2018 Monetary Policy Report. 00.511.522.500.511.522.5-10-5051015InflationExchange rate fluctuations20182011
       14 [16]  Figure 8.  Inflation and wage increase Annual percentage change   Note. Moving averages over 12 months. Sources: National Mediation Office, Statistics Sweden and the Riksbank But what about the causal relationships? There sometimes appears to be a tendency to see wage increases as the source of all inflation. The perceived chain of events is that an increase in inflation is always preceded by a tighter labour market pushing up wage increases and companies then passing on the increased costs in the form of higher prices. Can we therefore expect modest wage increases to push down inflation going forward?  No, such an unshakeable causal relationship between wage increases and inflation does not exist. It can just as easily be the case that stronger demand can allow companies to increase their prices. This increases their profits and margins, which in turn provides scope for them to raise wages. The interplay between prices, wages and activity in the economy – and of course a number of other variables, not least productivity – is complex.  There are quite a few studies that have examined the links between wage increases and future inflation and whether wage increases tend to precede or lag behind inflation. Not unexpectedly, the findings vary somewhat, but a fairly common finding seems to be that wage increases are not particularly informative when it comes to forecasting inflation.7 The fact that wage increases have been modest for a while need not therefore signify that inflation will fall in the period ahead. Personally, I believe that both inflation and long-term inflation expectations will remain close to 2 per cent going forward, even if monetary policy is made slightly less expansionary.                                                              7 See for instance Peneva and Rudd (2017). 00.511.522.5300.511.522.532.02.53.03.54.04.5InflationWage increase200720112018
       15 [16]  With inflation on target – new challenges So allow me to summarise. I think this survey presents three important economic policy challenges. An important starting-point is that inflation is on target. It has now been around the target of 2 per cent in outcomes and expectations for some time. Target attainment is good. Occasional monthly variations by the odd tenth of a percentage point around the 2 per cent mark must not determine monetary policy, as I see it. And given that inflation is on target, there is scope for considering other important macroeconomic variables.  The first challenge is that for several years there has been no correlation between unemployment and vacancies on the one hand and wage increases on the other. Unemployment has fallen but wage increases have remained steady at around 2 per cent as an annual rate. Inflation has indeed climbed back to target without any help from wage increases, which shows that inflation does not necessarily have to be wage-driven. But there is still reason to ask oneself how permanent the subdued wage increases are. The second challenge has to do with unemployment. The key question is: Has unemployment bottomed out? Or can it fall further with an expansionary monetary policy? My assessment is that it will not be possible to bring unemployment down much further with monetary policy alone. In my view, the increasing demand for labour that we are currently witnessing is more likely to lead to increased labour supply than to lower unemployment. This is also what Labour Force Survey flow statistics show. Further reduction in unemployment requires measures from other policy areas. The third and final challenge is the fact that skills matching on the labour market has deteriorated. This implies that output and employment are not as high as they could have been without the matching problems. Monetary policy can scarcely improve matching on the Swedish labour market. Here, too, measures in other policy areas are required. It is a question of increasing productivity among unemployed persons and reducing the cost of employing them. Labour market policy has a crucial role to play here.

1  “THE EU (ONCE AGAIN) AT THE CROSSROADS: THIS TIME MAY BE DIFFERENT?”  Keynote speech by Professor John (Iannis) Mourmouras* Bank of Greece Senior Deputy Governor Former Deputy Finance Minister at the National Bank of Romania - OMFIF Economists Meeting entitled “The state of the euro area and conditions for accession:  lessons from the past, tasks for the future”  Bucharest, 22 May 2018   Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,  Allow me first of all to thank the Governor of the National Bank of Romania, Mugur Isarescu, and the OMFIF Board of Directors for the kind invitation to deliver the keynote speech at today’s National Bank of Romania-OMFIF Economists Meeting. It is a great pleasure and honour to be in Romania, a country in which the 1821 Greek Independence Revolution has its roots. Prominent Greeks originating from here helped to free Greece from four hundred years of Ottoman rule. Your country today hosts a vibrant Greek business community, which I will be addressing at the Greek-Romanian Chamber of Commerce at a dinner event tonight.  In its history of six decades, the EU has been faced with multiple crises; it came close to breaking point, but managed to overcome, for instance, the ‘empty chair crisis’, when De Gaulle refused to take part in Council meetings, the rejection of the Maastricht Treaty by the Danes or the Nice Treaty by the Irish. The solution then and now is to move continuously pedalling forward, for instance, with the adoption of the single currency, the enlargement to Central and Eastern Europe after the end of the Cold War, and the completion of EMU today.  My speech today will be structured in four sections. After a brief introduction presenting the current economic juncture around the world, I will very briefly discuss the state of the euro area economy. In the second section, I will take a look into the incomplete architecture of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) and where we stand today, highlighting the downside risks of the lack of progress on the necessary reforms and, more particularly, the populist rise. The third section will be focused on the countries of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) as candidates for euro area accession and also present the benefits of EU membership, taking a look into the EU funds received under the current EU budget and how EU financing will evolve under the European Commission’s new proposals on the new budget for 2021-2027. I will also offer my view there on Romania’s prospective euro area accession. In the final section, I will offer some remarks about my own country, Greece, which seems to be finally coming out of the woods after three adjustment programmes within the eurozone.                                                            * Disclaimer: Views expressed in this speech are personal views and do not necessarily reflect those of the institutions I am affiliated with.  
2  1. Introduction and a few remarks on the state of the euro area economy   At a global level, as I was the official representative of the Bank of Greece to IMF/WB Spring Meetings last month in Washington DC, I would like to share with you my takeaways: caution and scepticism are the two catchwords I got from the Meetings. For instance, the heightened fears about an escalation of tensions between the US and China, in light of the US decision to impose tariffs on imports on national security grounds and the US stance in the negotiations over the revision of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), more specifically, the US demands to limit imports from Canada and Mexico. Markets are sceptical about the upturn since, on top of the threat of a global trade war, there are important risks (including geopolitical ones, breeding again in the US and I am referring to the US Administration’s decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal undermining global stability and threatening to disrupt the global order – the oil price has risen by almost 15% in the last month). Trade wars may be avoided, but trade tensions have been having an impact on market sentiment, posing risks for the upturn in the global economy.  In Europe, expectations for near-term euro area reforms are now very low. France has been putting pressure on Germany to come to concrete decisions on deepening EMU at the June European Council, including on the Banking Union. I will come back to EMU reform in more detail shortly.  Turning now to the state of the economy in the euro area, headline inflation was 1.3% in March, while core inflation was just 1%. Euro area GDP is expected to grow at 2.4% in 2018 and 2% in 2019 and to slow down to 1.6% in 2020 and this is worrying of course for the dynamics of output growth in the eurozone. Nothing lasts for good! The unemployment rate was 8.5% in February, the lowest since December 2008. The April 2018 Bank Lending Survey for the euro area concluded that credit standards eased considerably for loans to enterprises and housing loans, and loan demand increased across all categories, thereby continuing to support loan growth. As far as the ECB’s QE programme is concerned, ECB holdings amount to €1.96 trillion under the Public Sector Purchase Programme (PSPP), while total purchases under the Asset Purchase Programme (APP) amount to €2.39 trillion, and the APP is expected by the majority of economists to come to a close by year-end. The pace of APP purchases was reduced to €60 billion per month as of April 2017 (from €80 billion previously) and to €30 billion per month as of January 2018. 2. EMU reform and the risks from the lack of progress 2.1 EMU reform I would now like to discuss the concerns about the EMU setup, especially in the aftermath of the euro area debt crisis. The crisis brought to the surface major flaws in the euro area’s functioning, which had been building up over time and did not emerge overnight. The eurozone remains a job half-done and, without a doubt, the completion of the EMU architecture could further facilitate and motivate Member State reforms in view of euro area accession. 
3  On the positive side, one has to mention the establishment of a permanent rescue fund, the European Stability Mechanism, which provides financial assistance to euro area countries experiencing, or threatened by, severe financing problems, which can no longer borrow money on financial markets as a result. A Banking Union is on track to be completed, ensuring centralised supervision of systemically significant credit institutions subject to a single rulebook applicable across the European Union and also ensuring centralised resolution in the event of failure of such a credit institution. A Capital Markets Union is also under way, creating a new financial system that is less dependent on bank financing with the potential to increase risk-sharing via the private sector and address economic shocks. Although the EMU is now stronger, it is not yet fully shock-proof.  Table 1 Elements to complete an Economic and Monetary Union  Source: European Commission. I will stay a bit longer on the Banking Union which is of direct interest also to non-euro area EU Member States. It is currently still lacking key components that would ensure risk-sharing across the euro area and break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns. A reflection paper by the European Commission on deepening the Economic and Monetary Union proposed concrete steps that could be taken by the time of the European Parliament elections in 2019, but progress has fallen short of the European Commission’s ambitions.    
4  Figure 1 The three pillars of the Banking Union  Source: Single Resolution Board. There is still no agreement on the Commission’s proposal for its third pillar, consisting of a European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS), a banking union-wide scheme to be introduced by 2025, pooling funding from banks across the Banking Union to provide stronger and more uniform insurance cover for all retail depositors in the euro area.  Figure 2 The evolution of EDIS  Source: European Commission (2017), Factsheet “A stronger Banking Union”, p. 4. The existing Directive (2014/49/EU) on national Deposit Guarantee Schemes guaranteeing deposits of up to €100,000 also covers CEE Member States. Of course later, once EDIS is in place, a single deposit insurance fund would be of interest to CEE countries to offer deposit guarantee also through their national schemes, supported by a common pot. As you understand, this is a strong incentive to join the euro ultimately. 
5  Table 2 Deposit Guarantee Schemes in the EU and the US (EU 2012 figures in euro, US 2014 figures in US dollars) Source: European Commission, “Towards a European Deposit Insurance Scheme”, 9 November 2015. EDIS requires only €12 billion on behalf of Germany to create the common pot of €38 billion, a country that is dragging its feet on the issue. French banks account for the largest contributions to EDIS, as France – keen to the idea – has the largest banking sector in the euro area, followed by Germany. If we look at these sums, we should see them as a tiny hedging against the risk of systemic bank runs.  
6  Remember that what is at stake is a mass withdrawal of deposits in the case of a bank failure, which can create systemic financial instability. Even the announcement of establishing this common pot, would have a strong confidence-building effect on European depositors in the sense of avoiding risks of self-fulfilling prophecies on bank runs. It is one example par excellence showing how risk sharing may contribute to risk reduction. But, of course, EDIS approval is ultimately a question of political will, subject to national sensitivities. This number (€38 billion) is not even half of the one percent of the total eurozone deposits (worth more than €10 trillion today). 2.2 The risks arising from the lack of progress on reforms There are significant risks posed by the lack of progress towards completing the EMU architecture. So far, actions have not matched the rhetoric on completing EMU with the risk of missing what may be a limited window of opportunity to introduce fundamental reforms at a time of prosperity. The euro area recorded its fastest growth rate for a decade and has been expanding robustly for more than five years, but the fog of uncertainty thickens, when it comes to growth prospects in the years ahead. The Jean Monnet principle applies: “Europe is the sum of the solutions adopted to address the crises it is faced with”. If the flaws in the design of the euro area are not addressed at this opportune time, given that the next crisis may be around the corner and the job of fixing the EMU remains unfinished, this will come with a heavy price for the single currency. The collective memory tends to remember the costs rather than the benefits of European integration.  Many people, including myself, feel that we need to strike a balance in the classic struggle between solidarity and national responsibility, or the ‘new wine in the same old bottle’, namely risk-sharing (namely mutualisation of costs) versus risk reduction. Especially in the South of Europe, there is a strong feeling that this balance is unstable and in order to make it more stable and more symmetrical; what we need are stronger European institutions. To quote Winston Churchill, a great European, “to do our best is not enough; sometimes we must do what is required”. The ultimate risk is a rise in populism and anti-Europeanism. There is a rising populist trend across the world, as the following Figure (Figure 3) shows. Populism is no longer a marginalised trend, but is coming increasingly into the mainstream.   
7  Figure 3 The global rise of populism  Source: Rodrik, D. (2018), Populism and the economics of globalisation.  We can identify two major root causes of populism in Europe. First of all, it may be attributed to the failure of globalisation to reach some segments of the population, which have been left behind in terms of its economic benefits, for instance in Europe through chronic unemployment. Secondly, increased migration flows which triggered immigration fears and a stronger anti-euro sentiment and broader support for populist forces.  In Italy, the eurozone’s third-largest economy, two anti-establishment parties, the 5 Star Movement and the Northern League, which won 55% of the popular vote at the March general election, defeating the country’s traditional centrist political parties, have struck a deal to form an all-populist government with an anti-European sentiment. We should not take this prospect lightly, as Italy can be seen as a miniature representation of the whole of Europe.  Another disguised version of populism taking advantage of the Brexit prospect can be seen in the promise for broad-scale renationalisation, so-called Corbynomics, which would mean a return to the 1970s, by the British main opposition party leader, who has announced his intention to return to the model of nationalisation of banks, water industries, transport, etc., through the back door. Based on the pretext of market failures identified in their privatisation, full government control of such industries would be disastrous for the UK economy and the world, with a ‘megatone’ effect: 10 times bigger than Brexit.  Despite all this, a majority of EU citizens harbour a favourable opinion of EU membership, which has recovered to levels close to those recorded prior to the crisis. 57% of respondents to the European Parliament’s Parlemeter survey feel that the EU membership is a good thing for their country, almost as many as before the crisis (see Figure 4 below).   
8  Figure 4 Public opinion on EU membership  Source: European Parliament, “Parlemeter 2017 – A stronger voice. Citizens’ views on Parliament and the EU”, p. 17. In view of the upcoming European Parliament elections in June 2019, there are heightened fears of a further surge in populism in the form of protest votes, amidst the ongoing migration crisis. As the clock ticks down to the critical June European Council, European leaders must rise up to the challenge of introducing brave reforms and give to the people more reasons to trust the European Union as an endeavour and especially its institutions, because ultimately what the people want is jobs, growth and stability. 3. The candidate countries for euro area membership and the benefits from EU membership 3.1 The candidate countries Following the accession of Lithuania on 1 January 2015, the process of euro area enlargement has stalled and none of the 8 EU non-euro area Member States (see Figure 5 above) has so far actively pushed EMU accession. Out of the two Member States, whose national currencies are linked to the euro, Bulgaria has stated its intent to join the interim Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM2) and Denmark has opted out of euro area accession.  
9  Figure 5 Euro area and non-euro area member countries Source: European Commission, COM (2017) 821 final, “Further steps towards completing Europe’s Economic and Monetary Union: a roadmap”, p. 2. We do not expect any proposal for eventual euro area membership to be made in the ECB’s new Convergence Report, due to be published tomorrow (23 May), despite the progress made with regard to compliance with the five economic indicators, well-known as the “Maastricht criteria”, designed to ensure nominal economic convergence between interested non-euro area countries with the Member States of the euro area (see Table 3 below).  Table 3 Maastricht convergence criteria  Source: European Commission. 
10  The ECB publishes convergence reports every two years, or when there is a specific request from a Member State to assess its readiness to join the euro area. The new Convergence Report should point out that none of the countries under review, that is, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Croatia, Poland, Romania and Sweden (given that Denmark has an “opt-out”), is under an excessive deficit procedure and point out that progress has been made in addressing imbalances in their economies and further improvements of their fiscal positions.  As you are aware, crucial to the ECB’s Convergence Report is the notion of “sustainable convergence”, which is not automatic upon fulfillment of nominal convergence criteria prior to the adoption of the euro, but also requires policy efforts and appropriate national reforms following the entry into the euro area. President Juncker said in his State of the Union speech on 14 September 2017 that: “Member States that want to join the euro must be able to do so.” This is why he proposed the creation of “a Euro-Accession Instrument, offering technical and even financial assistance”. As shown in the following table, some of the CEE countries outperform the euro area average, for instance on the government budget deficit or general government debt thresholds of 3% and 60% respectively (see Tables 4 and 5 below).

Unlike some autocratic leaders (no names please) who want to be lonely riders in an era of globalisation and also want to rule their central bank and make decisions on interest rates: just look at what has happened with the Turkish lira last week. The European Union is a soft power and a community of values that has become a strong regional pole promoting shared prosperity, democracy, independent institutions, the rule of law and transparency across the European continent. Following the CEE countries’ EU accession, reform efforts have had to be sustained, as the EU has the potential to act as an external constraint by imposing common rules on its Member States and discipline on profligate politicians, through the transposition of the European acquis (for instance, combatting corruption).  3.2.2 EU financing to CEE Member States CEE Member States have been net recipients from the EU budget, as shown in Figure 6, and also in per capita terms, as shown in Figure 7. 
12   Figure 6 Net contributions to the EU budget by Member State (2016, in billion euro)  Source: European Commission, EU expenditure and revenue 2014-2020. 
13  Figure 7 Per capita net contributions to EU budget by Member State (2016, in euro)  Sources: European Commission, EU expenditure and revenue 2014-2020, and Eurostat. After EU accession and entry into the Single Market of 500 million consumers, the region has been recording rapidly improving economic growth rates offering an attractive environment for foreign investment, stronger demand, easy financing conditions and of course making the most of available EU funding, mainly through the EU’s structural and cohesion funds. Under the current EU budget (formally known as the Multiannual Financial Framework or MFF) for the period 2014-2020, the 6 CEE EU Member States (that are not members of the euro area) are allocated €157 billion or 45.4% of the total amount earmarked for the EU’s two structural funds (European Regional Development Fund - ERDF and the European Social Fund - ESF), and the Cohesion Fund. Among 6 CEE Member States, Poland is by far the largest recipient of EU structural and cohesion funds (22% of total allocations), followed by Romania (6.4% of total allocations). By way of comparison, Greece has been allocated €15.8 billion, which represent 4.6% of 
14  total allocations. The CEE economies enjoy around 4% of GDP gross inflows from the cohesion and CAP funds on average during the current 2014-2020 EU budget cycle. Table 6 EU funds allocated to CEE Member States and Greece under the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) 2014-2020  Country In € As % of total allocations Greece 15,774,066,781 4.6 Bulgaria 7,312,413,787 2.1 Croatia 8,245,993,253 2.4 Czech Republic 21,501,038,980 6.2 Hungary 21,444,582,271 6.2 Poland 76,345,205,832 22.0 Romania 22,283,994,996 6.4 Total 346,289,772,498 100 Note 1: The figures refer to the two structural funds, namely the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF), as well as the Cohesion Fund (CF). Note 2: EU funds allocated to other countries are estimated at about €160 billion. Source: European Commission.  This may drop by 0.2%-0.7% of GDP during the next seven-year period. Under the new MFF 2021-2027, for which the European Commission presented its proposal to the Council of Ministers on 14 May. The total budget is worth €1.28 trillion and amounts to 1.11% of EU gross national income, which is about 1/50th of most EU Member State government spending. The aim is for the new budget to be approved by spring 2019, but the proposal has several contentious parts and difficult and long-drawn negotiations are expected between the Member States especially given the large budget gap to be left by the UK’s exit from the EU which may be addressed through additional funding from the EU-27, on which there is already strong opposition. 3.2.3 Current status on Romania’s prospective accession into the euro area Romania has repeatedly pushed back its target dates for euro area accession from 2014 to 2015, then to 2019 and now to 2022. Between 2009 and 2013, the country had been subject to an excessive deficit procedure. Romania is currently experiencing an economic boom, with real GDP recording a post-crisis peak growth rate of 6.9% in 2017. This growth rate was driven by a boom in private consumption boosted by an expansionary fiscal policy and is expected to remain robust in the current year. According to the ECB’s previous Convergence Report, Romania now also meets the convergence criterion of price stability, which it did not fulfil according to earlier reports, along with the criteria on public debt and government deficit. So far, no decision has been made for the Romanian leu to enter the ERM2. I am not here to advise when would be the right time to enter the euro area. Any decision to adopt the single currency is up to the people and their democratic institutions. But I would like to give you a word of caution concerning the conversion rate between your currency and the euro and my remarks apply to all candidate countries for euro area membership, not only to Romania. This conversion rate is the key to euro area accession and, once fixed, it is irrevocable for each participating currency. With the benefit of hindsight, I could share with you the Greek euro area accession experience, where it is debatable even today if the entry to the euro back in 2001 was made on the valid conversion rate (overvalued); also many people claim that 
15  the country needed more time to put its economy in order. Ex post, this is evident by the country’s economic devastation triggered by the global financial crisis back in 2008, which turned into a full-blown double crisis, namely sovereign and banking crisis, in my country. In the case of Romania, things are quite simple. You don’t have to look at EU forecasts or Convergence Reports to find out. All you have to do is listen to the wise man that you are very lucky to have in this country: ask your Central Bank Governor Mugur Isarescu who, as you are aware, is widely regarded as one of a handful top central bankers in the world! 4. Post-MoU Greece Finally, a few words about my country: Greece’s economic recovery is finally gaining traction after an unprecedented depression, where the country lost 25% of GDP in the space of 10 years. Real GDP in 2017 increased by 1.4% with strong positive contributions from exports of goods and services (2 percentage points) and gross fixed capital formation (1.2 percentage points). This positive outcome creates a strong carry-over effect of 0.5 percentage point for GDP growth in the current year, which supports the outlook for a growth rate of around 2% and 2.5% in 2018 and 2019 respectively.  Indeed, this is a fortunate moment for Greece. After 9 years of economic hardship, we can say with confidence that there is light at the end of the tunnel for the Greek economy. The economy’s progress during the last eight years of adjustment has been really impressive, both in terms of fiscal and external adjustment of more than 15 percentage points of GDP. The huge twin deficits turned into surpluses. Last year, the primary surplus was 4.2% of GDP, outperforming the target of 0.5%. The current account during the last two years had effectively been in balance, from a 15% deficit eight years ago. And last year: an all-time record of 30 million tourists visited the country. Throughout this period, sweeping structural reforms have been implemented, covering the pensions system, the health system, labour markets, product markets, the business environment, public administration, etc. Moreover, there is evidence that the economy has been undergoing a rebalancing towards the tradable, export-oriented sector: the share of exports of goods and services in GDP increased from 19% in 2009 to 28% in 2016, with most of the increase coming from exports of goods. Two weeks ago the results of the Greek banks’ 2018 stress tests conducted by the ECB were published, pointing to no capital shortfalls. Of course, despite the positive outcome of the stress tests, the major challenges are still there: for instance the drastic reduction of the non-performing loans and the ability to provide liquidity to the Greek real economy (new loans to businesses). In view of the end of the current programme in August 2018 and a return to European normality, the Greek people look into the future with optimism, which I also share, provided that there is no complacency, no slackening of effort, and authorities do not let up on reforms, especially in the public sector, cutting red tape, etc. The overwhelming majority in Greece still want to be within the core of Europe. This is our legacy as a nation that goes back to our history and our tradition. After all, the 
16  name of our continent Europe comes, in the first place, from an ancient Greek mythological figure, a beautiful young lady with whom Zeus, the father of the twelve Greek Gods, fell in love, but since she was refusing his advances, he decided to transform himself into a bull to catch her and bring her to Mount Olympus, the mountain of Gods in northern Greece, where I come from!  Concluding remarks In closing, I understand that public sentiment in Central and Eastern European countries is not very strong right now in favour of joining the single currency and that euro area accession is seen by some as a byword for the loss of sovereignty. The crisis has certainly made the euro area look less attractive for future members. In my view, the issue is ultimately, on the one hand, for the eurozone to persist with completing the EMU project and, on the other hand, for candidate countries to be at a par with the rest of the eurozone on all fronts (sustainable convergence). After all, CEE Member States have considerable discretion over the timing of their accession into the euro area. Amid the uncertainty about the euro area’s architecture, a wait-and-see approach for final outcomes is perhaps the safe-bet policy, given that any decision to adopt the single currency, once made, is irreversible, since the costs of exit by far outweigh the benefits. Thank you very much for your attention. 
Jessica Chew Cheng Lian: Launch of FSPB Professional Code forthe Financial Services IndustryWelcome address by Ms Jessica Chew Cheng Lian, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank ofMalaysia (Bank Negara Malaysia), at the Launch of FSPB Professional Code for the FinancialServices Industry, Kuala Lumpur, 24 May 2018.*   *   *I am delighted to be here to witness the launch of the Financial Services Professional Board(FSPB) Professional Code for the Financial Services Industry. Thank you for allowing me anopportunity to offer some brief remarks this morning on the importance of this initiative from BankNegara Malaysia’s perspective.   Let me begin by saying that the launch of the Code comes at a time when issues of culture andconduct in the financial industry have become an important focal point for financial regulators.After a hive of activity largely focused on strengthening prudential rules and standards, there is anacknowledgement that behaviour is ultimately regulated by something that runs deeper thanrulebooks. It is not an easy thing to put your finger on. Regulators have talked about “the waythings get done” in an institution, or “the human element in everyday decisions”. We like to thinkof it as how one behaves when no one is watching. On this score, the financial industry could do better. Despite much publicity and widespreadefforts to tackle the issue, incidents of misconduct continue to cast a dark shadow over thefinancial services industry across the world. This is worrying, because misconduct erodes trustin the system. If investors, depositors and policy holders stop believing that their interests arebeing safeguarded, the entire system quickly comes unraveled at significant costs to society.These costs can arise from failures of financial institutions, a misallocation of economicresources, or simply steep fines that destroy shareholder value and employment prospects foraffected workers. Since the global financial crisis, banks have paid more than USD320 billion in fines and legalcosts and have been the subject of numerous Government financial inquiries due to misconduct.In Malaysia, in the last 5 years, Bank Negara Malaysia has imposed fines on financial servicesproviders to the tune of RM116 million. A survey conducted by the Bank revealed that almost two-thirds of reported losses by banks in 2016 were associated with internal fraud, regulatory non-compliance and operational lapses. We have examined these incidents in some depth. Our observations lead us to conclude thatbehaviour is very much influenced bycontextual factors such as organisational values, incentivesand management responses to misconduct or non-compliance. The rightcontextual setting canexert a powerful influence on individual behaviour. We believe this begins with setting and clearlycommunicating expectations of desired behaviour. Without clarity on what is acceptable in thefirst place, it would not be possible to encourage, much less enforce, these expectations.The FSPB serves an important role in this regard through its work in defining and developingcodes of behaviour for financial institutions.Given the stronger focus of financial regulators on conduct and culture, such professional codeswill matter greatly going forward as an important complement to regulatory standards.The FSPB is well placed to lead and support initiatives to establish standards of conduct for thefinancial industry. Its standards not only serve as useful frameworks for financial institutions andprofessional bodies to develop specific guidance for their own employees and members; theyalso serve to embody the industry’s collective commitment to socially responsible values and 1 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
ethics. For example, I noted with interest that the Professional Code being launched today commits todealing with counterparties, including suppliers and agents that “subscribe to sound ethicalprinciples”. Matters such as the environmental footprint or human rights record of third partyproviders are not typical obligations currently found in regulatory standards, yet, these arematters of great importance. They are a reflection of the values of the industry, and they matter tomany conscientious consumers in this age of increasingly accessible information.Given the central role of financial services in any economy, these are issues likely to move fromthe periphery to increasingly important business considerations. At the global level, we arealready seeing greater attention given to sustainable and responsible finance. In many cases, itwill require the industry to draw on experience beyond the traditional core competencies of mostfinancial services providers. The industry, through FSBP, can demonstrate much neededbusiness leadership in addressing broader ethical questions that will increasingly confront us asa society and as global citizens.Apart from what ends up in written codes, there is also important value in simply having frankconversations about shared ethical challenges. In the United Kingdom, senior bankers gottogether to discuss ways to reform organisational culture following the widespread PPI mis-selling scandals, but some would consider this “too little too late”. We need to bring suchdiscussions forward and actively encourage a process that would allow the industry to get in frontof emerging issues around professional conduct and ethics. These include examining issues likehow institutions might go about gaining a pulse on culture at various levels within theorganisation, and the effects of incentive structures on behaviour.With the digital revolution, there will be an increasing need for the industry to come together toset standards for novel areas of practice. Already now there is much buzz about the use ofartificial intelligence and big data in finance. This creates opportunities for innovation, efficiencyand growth, but also new risks, challenges and – without a doubt – difficult ethical questions onlines that should be drawn to prevent unfair, systematic, discrimination against specific groups,(for instance as a result of algorithmic programs) the inappropriate use of personal data andexcessive volatilities from high-frequency trading.As the industry navigates these issues, a shared commitment to a common set of values hasnever been more critical to build trust – with customers, with employees, with other financialinstitutions, and with the public at large.  There are compelling economic, not just social or moral,reasons to do so. It encourages healthy competition, more efficient and sustainable markets, andconsistently high levels of performance over the long term.The FSPB, however, cannot achieve this alone. Deliberate and sustained efforts by the industrywill be needed to engage, to communicate, to educate and to internalise these shared values. By pooling inputs across the industry, richer worked examples can be developed to shed light onhow ethical principles should apply in practice. The consequences of misconduct should also beclear and unambiguous to firmly entrench behavioural norms – both within individual financialinstitutions and at an industry level. As you are aware, moves in this direction are already beingtaken with the requirement financial institutions to capture and share information on employeemisconduct to inform hiring decisions beginning from July this year.  The Bank on its part will continue to provide a credible deterrent against misconduct throughenforcement actions.  With the enactment of the Financial Services Act 2013, the Bank has nothesitated to use wider enforcement powers that include stiff administrative penalties providedunder the Financial Services Act to bring institutions to book for serious conduct breaches, andbarring individuals from holding senior roles in financial institutions. We will continue to pursueinvestigations and enforcement actions into serious conduct breaches to the full extent of powersprovided under laws administered by the Bank.  Beyond the limits of the Bank’s powers, the Bank 2 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
maintains close cooperation with other authorities to facilitate investigations and enforcementactions. ConclusionBuilding trust is not easy. It takes hard work, a determination to do the right thing and confidenceto make judgements in situations that are not always well-defined. Taken in this context, the workof the FSPB serves as an important anchor for decisions and actions that will engender trust inthe financial industry.  In a fast moving world, a strong commitment to a professional code ofconduct provides the assurance that the public seeks – that financial institutions and employeesare held to and will consistently demonstrate high standards of professional and ethicalconduct.  I hope that the industry will continue to lend its strong support to the FSPB’s work. Followingtoday’s launch of the Professional Code, the Bank would urge financial institutions andprofessional bodies to reflect the standards set out in the Code in the values and conduct thatyou demand of your staff, agents and members. This needs to move beyond symbolic gestures,to the diligent implementation of policies and programs that promote the desired culture. TheBank is confident that the FSPB will continue to play an important role in supporting these efforts– including through its work to identify implementation challenges, develop solutions andintroduce improvements to reflect emerging issues.The financial industry has demonstrated leadership in so many areas – surely none can be asimportant as leadership in something as fundamental as professional and ethical conduct. Onthat note, let me once again commend and congratulate the FSPB on this important, andcertainly most relevant initiative.  3 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
Benoît Cœuré: Interview in Die ZeitInterview with Mr Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank,in Die Zeit, conducted by Ms Lisa Nienhaus and Mr Mark Schieritz on 16 May 2018 and publishedon 23 May 2018.*   *   *Mr Cœuré, we need to talk about Italy, where two populist parties are currently trying toform a coalition. In a draft paper they demanded debt relief of €250 billion from theEuropean Central Bank. They have since withdrawn that demand, but it’s still a shock,isn’t it? The political discussion is still ongoing in Italy. The ECB will assess the new government’s planswhen they are made public.So, to make the question more general: can the ECB relieve a euro area country fromthe debts owed to it by that country?No, it cannot. European treaties prohibit any such debt relief. Central banks cannot financegovernments.The coalition agreement includes tax cuts and spending increases that add up to morethan €100 billion according to estimates. Italy is already a heavily indebted country. Areyou concerned?Again, it’s too early to comment on plans we don’t know. On fiscal policy in general, the ECB’sview is well known: Europe has fiscal rules and they should be respected. This is a matter oftrust in our common currency.The ECB’s large-scale purchases of government bonds are highly controversial,especially in Germany. Many of your critics now feel vindicated. Wouldn’t it be true to saythat if you were not buying those bonds, then nobody would be able to call for debtrelief?It’s not that simple. The purchase of government bonds is within our mandate. It proved decisivein enabling the euro area economy to overcome the crisis and in restoring growth and pricestability in Europe. That is why I will always defend our actions. And we designed the assetpurchase programme in such a way that it is not in breach of the treaties. How did you do that? For example, we set a strict limit on how much we buy, so as to safeguard the functioning of thebond market. Moreover, the purchases are mainly made by the national central banks, which buytheir national government bonds at their own risk: the Bundesbank buys German governmentbonds, the Banca d’Italia buys Italian government bonds, and so forth. They would have to bearthe bulk of the losses if a government could not service its debt. I have always supported thisarrangement because it ensures that the ECB does not introduce a fiscal union through thebackdoor.That means that if the Italians failed to repay their debt they would in the first instanceharm themselves. The Italian central bank would then bear the heaviest losses.I can’t comment on hypothetical scenarios.The euro area Heads of State or Government want to launch a reform of Monetary Union 1 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
in June. As you said yourself, the economy is growing, the crisis is over. Why the needfor yet more reforms? Indeed, the euro area expansion is strong and broad based. But as Christine Lagarde, the headof the International Monetary Fund, often says [quoting JF Kennedy]: the time to repair the roof iswhen the sun is shining. Europe has been made more stable over the past few years, but we arenot there yet and now is the right time to complete the job. Have you honestly ever met a politician that fixed the roof when the sun was shining?Most only start repairing it when it’s raining.That is understandable, but if you’re right, it means that when the next crisis occurs Europeanleaders will once again have to improvise a wobbly solution during a hectic late-night meeting inBrussels. I don’t think that’s how citizens expect Europe to be governed.But isn’t that precisely how Europe has always been governed?It was at the height of the debt crisis, because the situation at the time was unprecedented. Theproblem with late-night meetings is that, while we can get things done and indeed succeeded indoing so then, this type of improvised decision-making sows the seeds of mistrust – betweengovernments, between citizens and politicians. It is not a tenable situation. Europe needs stablerules and institutions. In this connection, the ECB has called for a European deposit insurance scheme. SoGerman banks would have to pay towards reimbursing savers in Italy and Spain if banksin those countries failed. How would that make Europe more resilient to crises?Let me put this discussion in perspective. We need three lines of defence for our MonetaryUnion. The first is to have well-functioning private markets, which are not yet fully in place. TheSingle Market needs to be completed, particularly in the services sector. Capital markets are alsostill too domestic. The second line of defence is to have sound fiscal policies in the MemberStates. Most countries have now reduced their deficit, but that is mainly thanks to favourablecyclical conditions. Fiscal improvement should be made structural, otherwise governments won’thave fiscal space when the next recession hits. Euro area-wide protection mechanisms such asthe European Stability Mechanism, the Single Resolution Fund for banks, or a new depositinsurance scheme are only the third line of defence. All existing currency unions have such orsimilar mechanisms to safeguard the stability of their currency.What exactly does deposit insurance protect us against?For one, it can enhance confidence in the banking system by preventing savers from emptyingtheir bank accounts in a crisis situation. History has taught us that such bank runs are highlydangerous.That all sounds fine, but Germany has a different perspective: a common depositinsurance scheme means that Germans would also be affected if, say, a bank in Italyfailed. To return to the metaphor: if it rains, the roof would be in a worse state after therepair than before. Why should we agree to that?With a proper European deposit insurance scheme, Germans would have fewer problems ratherthan more. A deposit insurance scheme should be seen as an insurance against economicrisks, just as you take out liability insurance to protect yourself against the risk of an accident. Ifrisks are properly priced, it’s not a system of transfers between countries and still less from the“North” to the “South”, as is too often argued.  Of course, banks would need to further reducerisks before the deposit insurance scheme is introduced. Much has been done recently in thatrespect. 2 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
And if the reforms can’t be managed by June? At the moment, all parties seem to be busy drawing their red lines. It would send a more positivesignal to think about what they can achieve together. Let me give you two reasons why this isurgent. First, who knows what the next crisis will look like? If our Monetary Union is not madestronger now, then the ECB will have to come to the rescue again the next time there is a crisis,and this may then lead us to test the limits of our mandate. Who knows what the next crisis willlook like?  That’s not what Germans expect of a central bank, and rightly so. Second, the world isin disarray, and many expect Europe to show the way. Failing to decide on our own future wouldsend a signal that we don’t know what we want.Germany is being very cautious on Europe at the moment. Olaf Scholz says that aGerman finance minister is first and foremost a German finance minister. Do you find thatdisappointing?Absolutely not. Mr Scholz is doing his job. And he also said that strengthening Europe is veryimportant to the German government. What surprises me about the debate in Germany is thatthe impression is often given that half of Europe is after Germany’s money.Isn’t that the case? No, above all it’s about putting the right rules in place, strengthening the euro area’s institutionsand making sure that goods, services and capital markets work better. All of this is in Germany’sinterest. And not just because other European countries buy German products, but also becauseGerman savings are invested in Europe. But the French government is also arguing for a European budget and a Europeanfinance minister. That is about the money.  I believe that a euro area fiscal capacity can be useful to finance investment, including ineconomic downturns – provided, of course, that Member States respect Europe’s fiscal rules inthe first place.   Many politicians don’t like to be told by the ECB what to do or what not to do.  I know that we central bankers sometimes get on politicians’ nerves. But it is our job to keep thecurrency stable, and that requires stable political foundations. The conditions for improving thesefoundations have rarely been as good as they are now, because the economy is doing well.And what if the trade disputes escalate?  A fully fledged trade war would have a very negative impact. At the ECB we’ve analysed theimpact of an increase in tariffs worldwide. The results are pretty bleak. But that’s not where weare right now. Economic growth has moderated recently, but from exceptionally high levels. So,we are not too concerned at the moment. We expect the economic expansion to continue, andwe are increasingly confident that inflation will rise towards our aim of below, but close to, 2%.  So you will soon be able to end your asset purchases? At the end of last year I said that I didn’t expect that our asset purchase programme would needto be extended again. I see no reason to change my view.What do you mean exactly?The programme is currently expected to run until September. We still need to have a discussionabout exactly how it will end. 3 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
Oh, and we thought that ending it meant ending it, i.e. stopping in September.The baseline expectation is, as Mario Draghi has said, that there will be no sudden stop. This is atechnical discussion. 4 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
Yannis Stournaras: Sources of financing of the Greek economySpeech by Mr Yannis Stournaras, Governor of the Bank of Greece, at an event organised by theFoundation for Economic and Industrial Research (IOBE) and the Athens Stock Exchange,Athens, 19 March 2018.*   *   *Ladies and gentlemen,It is a great pleasure for me to be here with you today for the presentation of a verycomprehensive IOBE report, which draws on a wealth of information to discuss, among otherthings, the impact of the distorted growth model of the past and the pressing need to adjust it. Iam also glad to see that the findings of IOBE and its proposals on how to achieve thisadjustment are in line with the recommendations made by the Bank of Greece in successivereports. It is also encouraging that, even as a forced response to the crisis and with small steps,this adjustment has been underway for a few years now.The protracted and deep crisis that Greece experienced over the past ten years has broughtabout three major changes that are relevant to its growth model. First, bank lending, whichused to be the main source of financing for households and businesses, collapsed. Second,private investment, residential investment in particular, shrank. Third, the production structurebecame more extrovert against a background of recession in the domestic economy.Starting with the changes in the real economy, the transition to a new, more extrovertgrowth model has already begun and can be expected to continue. Businesses, adaptingto the new conditions of declining domestic demand, have strengthened their export orientationand, as a result, the percentage of output that is exported has increased in all sectors. Exports ofgoods and services as a percentage of GDP rose from about 19% in 2009 to 33% in 2017, i.e. by14 percentage points. This improvement has been driven by goods exports and, to a lesserextent, by services exports. A case in point is the refinery industry, which has become one of themost extrovert among manufacturing sectors.Developments in productive investment as a driver of growth have been lessencouraging. Overall, gross capital formation in the private sector has declined over the last tenyears, from 22% of GDP in 2007 to 8% in 2017 at current prices. Of this total 14 percentage pointdecline, the largest part (11 percentage points) is attributable to a contraction of householdinvestment, chiefly in housing. Business investment, on the other hand, showed a smallerdecrease, but remains alarmingly low (4.8% of GDP in 2017, compared with 8% in 2007).Excluding depreciation, net capital investment by businesses has remained negative since 2009,standing at about €4.3 billion or –2.4% of nominal GDP in the third quarter of 2017. However, inorder for the capital stock and potential growth of the Greek economy to increase, positive netcapital investment is crucial. For this to happen, private investment must rise by 50% in thecoming years. Therefore, the Greek economy needs an investment shock, with a focus onproductive and extrovert business investment, to avoid output hysteresis and foster a rebalancingof the growth model in favour of tradeable goods and services.One of the obstacles to the adjustment of the economy is the scarcity of investment finance.In recent years, the household saving ratio has been negative. Businesses, on the other hand,have used up part of their own resources in recent years in order to service liabilities, in theabsence of profitability and access to market-based financing, also as a result of capital controls.Turning to external financing, i.e. from banks and capital markets, bank credit remains subdued,while alternative market financing sources are still underdeveloped. Businesses’ market-basedfinancing virtually collapsed during the crisis years and turned negative from 2011 to 2015. It has 1 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
since rebounded, but remains well below pre-crisis levels, while it has deteriorated anew sincethe last quarter of 2016.In an environment, post-crisis, of bank lending scarcity and tighter credit standards, businesseshave sought to cover their financing needs through alternative types of external financing, inaddition to their own resources. These alternative types included non-bank loans, i.e. loans fromdomestic financial institutions other than banks, as well as foreign borrowing, mostly intragrouploans and corporate bonds issued on international markets. They also raised unlisted equityfinancing, while particularly muted was the domestic issuance of corporate bonds (€600 millionin 2017) and listed shares. Improved economic conditions helped Greek businesses with positivegrowth prospects to regain access to international markets, with bond issuance coming to €1.1billion in 2017, relatively more moderate compared with €6.3 billion in 2012–2014.Small and medium-sized enterprises, which make up the vast majority of Greek businesses,were disproportionally hit, compared with large businesses with high credit ratings, by thecontinued contraction in domestic bank lending, given their almost exclusive reliance on banklending for their external financing.The supply of bank credit, traditionally a key source of financing for Greek businesses,inevitably decreased during the crisis, as banks faced strong pressures on their liquidity,profitability and capital adequacy from the combined impact of: (a) their inability to accessinternational markets; (b) continuous deposit outflows; (c) the public debt restructuring; (d) therecession, as well as strategic default practices, on the quality of their loan portfolios; and (e)capital controls.The ECB’s interventions were crucial in supporting and restoring smooth monetary policytransmission to the real economy. At the European level, credit growth turned positive long ago,whereas in Greece it would have been far more negative in the absence of these measures.The improvement in confidence in the Greek banking system and the tackling of theproblem posed by the high stock of non-performing loans can be expected to further boostbank lending. On a positive note, the annual contraction in credit growth observed during thecrisis seems to have eased considerably, in particular with respect to credit to non-financialcorporations, which rose in 2017 relative to 2016, as reflected in disbursements of new loanswith a defined maturity.The completion of the two pillars of the Banking Union, i.e. the Single SupervisoryMechanism and the Single Resolution Mechanism, has already contributed significantly torestoring confidence, as the supervisory authorities uniformly and strictly assess banks’soundness and require banks to maintain high capital adequacy ratios and, at the same time,improve the quality of their balance sheets. The completion of the third pillar, the Europeandeposit insurance scheme, will bolster confidence even further.Reducing the high stock of non-performing loans will exert a beneficial effect on economicactivity and productivity via two channels: (a) increased supply of bank loans; and (b) therestructuring of the productive sector. According to Bank of Greece estimates and research, areduction in non-performing loans will help reduce banks’ financial risk and drive down theirfunding costs, while also boosting their capital adequacy.This will gradually translate into higher loan supply and lower lending rates to businessesand households. Meanwhile, business and household financial risk will decline as the economyrecovers, producing valuation gains on their existing assets and higher returns on capital and realestate property. The creditworthiness of households and businesses will therefore increase,enabling further support to investment demand. Finally, the resolution of non-performing loanswill free up resources which, if allocated to more productive businesses and sectors, will lead to 2 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
higher total productivity. Crucial will be the financial support to business start-ups, which have astronger growth potential than well-established businesses and can prove to be big job creators.Today, the domestic banking system is clearly stronger than at the start of the crisis. Banks’capital adequacy ratios are satisfactory, higher than the EU average; profitability, ROE and ROAindicators have improved; and the actions taken to tackle the problem of non-performing loansseem to be bearing fruit, as the NPL stock is continuously falling in line with the targets set.During 2017, the outstanding balance of banks’ non-performing exposures decreased by some€11 billion, but still remains high (about €95 billion as at end-2017).In addition to the NPL-reducing impact of solid recovery, further NPL reduction can also beexpected to come from the acceleration of real estate e-auctions, which will help improve thepricing of collateral undergoing liquidation that inevitably loses value so long as its sale isdelayed. These delays hamper the development of a secondary loan market, as well as theimplementation of other measures that would speed up judicial proceedings and facilitate theactive management of at least part of non-performing loans under legal protection, in particularthose presumably owed by strategic defaulters.It is worth noting that, even in the cases where banks have agreed on multi-creditor workouts,several months are needed to complete the relevant legal procedures before these workouts canbe implemented, obviously depriving the economy of resources. Following the publication of therelevant guidelines by the European Commission, the possibility of transferring NPEs to one ormore central entities to be set up for this purpose could be considered.However, despite the important role that banks will continue to play in Greece and the EU, inparticular for small and medium-sized enterprises, market participants have, for years now,pointed out the pressing need to expand long-term financing sources.Apart from the traditional forms of investment financing, e.g. bank credit and guaranteeinstruments, more active use could be made of the capital markets or alternative financinginstruments such as the following:(1) equity funding, including venture capital, equity crowdfunding and specialised platforms forpublic listing of SMEs;(2) hybrid instruments, such as convertible bonds and mezzanine finance, typically involvingdebt instruments that, subject to a trigger, can be converted to equity;(3) non-bank debt financing, such as corporate bonds, securitised debt and covered bonds.With the exception of corporate bonds, market-based financing is virtually non-existentin Greece for small and medium-sized enterprises, as shown by the present IOBE study, and isalso very limited at European level. In the EU, market-based financing of small and medium-sized enterprises accounts for less than 15% of their total financing, and is very costly. A keyproblem is that investors lack information on small and medium-sized enterprises. In this regard,around 25% of all companies and around 75% of owner-managed companies in Europe donot have a credit score, according to the European Commission’s Green Paper on Building aCapital Markets Union.The extent of the problem across the EU led the European Commission, in 2015, to drawup and launch an ambitious plan for building a single EU-wide capital market by 2019. Theplan aims to improve access to financing for all businesses across Europe, increase anddiversify the sources of funding, and make markets work more effectively and efficiently, byremoving obstacles that make investor and business access to capital markets harder andcostlier. 3 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
Well-developed capital markets deliver considerable benefits to market participants andeconomic activity in general. First, they enable businesses to diversify their financing sources,thereby reducing their reliance on bank credit, and create an environment that is more resilient toshocks. Second, they help to improve the allocation of capital in the economy and risk sharing,by offering investors a broader array of options and enabling them to make their investmentdecisions in line with their risk appetites and therefore finance even businesses that would havebeen seen, by banks, as too risky to lend to. Third, equity financing in particular boostsinvestment without necessarily increasing private debt in the economy.Progress towards the creation of a Capital Markets Union has been steady, but ratherslow. Of the eight legislative proposals submitted by the European Commission before earlyMarch 2018, three have been approved so far by the European Parliament and the Council andconcern: simple, transparent and standardised securitisation as an additional source of financingin particular for small and medium-sized enterprises and start-ups; the European Venture CapitalFund and European Social Entrepreneurship Fund Regulations, aimed to facilitate investment ininnovative companies; and the revision of the Prospectus Directive with a view to facilitating theaccess of small and medium-sized enterprises’ to capital markets. The five remaining proposalsare still being negotiated. Meanwhile, during the past two weeks, the European Commissionreleased five new proposals on: an Action Plan on how to harness the opportunities presented bytechnology-enabled innovation in financial services (FinTech) and crowdfunding; an Action Planon sustainable finance for a greener and cleaner economy; common rules on covered bonds asa stable and cost-effective source of funding for credit institutions, especially where markets areless developed, which would translate into lower borrowing costs for the economy at large; aproposed Directive aimed to reduce barriers to cross-border distribution of investment funds,making it simpler, faster and less costly; and the clarification of the law applicable to cross-border transactions in claims and securities, promoting cross-border investment.Once finalised and implemented, this legislative package can be expected to remove barriers tothe geographical diversification of investor portfolios, which reduce market liquidity andhamper business expansion. Private investors in the EU usually keep their funds in bankdeposits with short-term maturities. Moreover, institutional investors, in particular insuranceundertakings and pension funds, with traditionally long investment horizons, have reduced theirequity investment to 5-10% of their total portfolios. The Capital Markets Union, by facilitatingaccess to attractive investment on competitive and transparent terms, is expected to encouragesuch investors to invest in equity instruments within the EU. This will help tackle the challengesthat population ageing and low interest rates pose to the viability of social security funds, while atthe same time opening up financing opportunities for businesses.Overall, however, as bank credit and the recourse to alternative financing sources are notexpected – at least in the short term – to increase enough to bring about the quantum leap inbusiness investment needed for sustainable growth, an aggressive policy for attractingstrategic foreign direct investment is necessary. This need becomes all the more pressingconsidering that the saving-to-GDP ratio of the domestic private sector dropped dramaticallyduring the crisis, from 15.3% of GDP in 2007 to 3.8% in the first three quarters of 2017.If the country is to attract foreign direct investment, priority must be given to eliminating majorcounterincentives, such as red tape, an unclear and shifting legislative and regulatoryframework, an unpredictable tax system, inadequate protection of property rights, and delays incontract enforcement. Although foreign direct investment in Greece has been on an upward trendfor the past two years, starting, true, from low levels, its share in GDP is still well below that ofGreece’s South-eastern European trading partners, as well as the EU and euro area averages.Emphasis should also be placed on promoting co-financed projects and systematically utilisingthe resources of European Structural Funds under the new Strategic Reference Framework2014–2020, as well as under other programmes such as those of the European Strategic 4 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
Investment Fund and the European Investment Bank. The active utilisation of theseinnovative financial instruments and of the advantages they present over traditional grantscan maximise the growth impact of EU resources available for investment in the Greekeconomy.These financial instruments provide opportunities for: mobilising and blending funds from variousEU, public or private sources; revolving funds for the financing of other investment; andleveraging additional public and private resources. In this manner, the final amount of financingcan turn out to be much larger than the initially available EU resources, creating a multipliereffect for the real economy. According to a European Commission report published inDecember 2017, Greece has committed 9% of the total resources under the European RegionalDevelopment Fund and the Cohesion Fund through financial instruments, compared with 19%for Slovenia, 18% for Portugal and 8% for the EU as a whole. However, several of these financialinstruments, despite having been activated, remain untapped.Bank of Greece research also indicates the important role of public investment in boostingbusiness investment. Higher public investment is expected to have a favourable effect onaggregate demand and total productivity in the private sector and to create incentives forinvestment initiatives.Most importantly however, what is needed is a continuation of reforms andprivatisations, starting with the elimination of obstacles to large investment projects that havealready been agreed upon, but are lagging. Greece must consolidate investor confidence in thecontinuation of reforms and convince that fiscal policy will not relapse once again in the wrongdirection, succumbing to clientelism and to a stifling by the State of private initiative. This wouldhave a positive impact on the terms of Greece’s return to the markets, improve market sentimentand help attract investment. It would also encourage the return of deposits to banks, therebyenhancing banks’ lending capacity. The above would set in motion a virtuous circle for theeconomy and the banking system and create the necessary conditions for investment financingand a return to sustainable growth.If consolidating confidence is a sine qua non for the above, i.e. for the increase of both domesticand total investment, Greece must also take full advantage of the possibilities arising fromEU and euro area membership to create a financial safety net that would convince of itsability to cope with any headwinds that could make its financing costs unsustainable, in particularin an international environment rife with financial and geopolitical challenges.Ladies and gentlemen,Today, Greece faces the historic challenge of returning to normality and to a path of convergencewith its European partners. A return to strong and sustainable growth calls for maintaining andimplementing the structural reforms already legislated, as well as further crucial reforms in areasthat are still lagging behind, such as the tax system, public administration, the judicial system,the link between production, research and education, the legislative and regulatory framework,especially as regards the use of land, and the goods and services markets. It is obvious that onlyon this condition can Greece once again become a friendly place for doing business, effectivelysupport productive investment and make a successful leap in total factor productivity.In closing, I would like to underline that, in the long run, increasing investment require an increasein private sector saving (by households and non-financial corporations), which, as I pointed outearlier, has declined dramatically, dropping by 11.5 percentage points as a ratio of GDP, in tenyears. The fall in saving was particularly sharp in the years 2015–2016, for households andbusinesses alike. Admittedly, the capital controls combined with higher taxation led householdsand businesses to tap their savings, in order to meet their current needs. 5 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
However, there can be no investment without domestic saving or, alternatively, without continuedforeign financing. This is why it is so important in the long run to restore the saving capacity ofthe private sector. In this context, the development of the second and third pillars of the socialsecurity system will not only ensure the system’s viability, but will also encourage households toincrease their saving and open up a new channel for the financing of business investment. Thiswill enable Greece, in a self-reliant manner, to increase its productive capacity and build the newgrowth model on sound foundations. 6 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
Stephen S Poloz: Release of the Financial System ReviewOpening statement by Mr Stephen S Poloz, Governor of the Bank of Canada, and Ms CarolynWilkins, Senior Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada, at the press conference following therelease of the Financial System Review, Ottawa, Ontario, 7 June 2018.*   *   *Governor Poloz:Good morning, and thank you for being here today. Senior Deputy Governor Wilkins and I arepleased to be with you to talk about the latest issue of the Bank’s Financial System Review(FSR), which we published today.Let me quickly remind everyone about the purpose of the FSR—to identify key vulnerabilities inthe financial system, which can interact with and magnify economic shocks. We monitor theevolution of these vulnerabilities, and then apply a set of risk scenarios to look at the potentialimplications for the financial system and economy if a significant shock were to occur.The main vulnerabilities that we see today are the same as those in the last FSR in November. Iwill begin with a few words about two of these: elevated household debt and imbalances inhousing markets. These vulnerabilities are expected to persist for some time, although we haveseen continued signs of easing.Several factors are helping to lessen the vulnerability related to household indebtedness.Importantly, there has been a series of changes to mortgage lending guidelines. We have alsoseen a slowdown in credit growth along with higher interest rates. As well, a solid expansion inthe Canadian economy is leading to strong growth in employment and income and, over time,this will support Canadians’ ability to manage their debt, even at a time of rising interest rates.The changes to mortgage lending guidelines are driving a steady improvement in the quality ofnew loans. We have seen a decline in the share of mortgages that have a loan-to-income ratioabove 450 per cent. In fact, the share of new insured mortgages that have a ratio above thisthreshold has been cut in half since the middle of 2016. This is an important improvement,because we know that households with this level of debt are more vulnerable to an economicshock, such as a recession.However, I will point out two reasons for continued vigilance. First, because the total amount ofdebt carried by Canadian households is so large, we know that it will be with us for a long time.Second, it is still too soon to fully assess the impact of the newest changes to mortgage lendingguidelines. These guidelines, which came into effect at the start of the year, were aimed attightening standards for uninsured mortgages. It is not yet clear whether the guidelines aredriving a significant amount of activity away from federally regulated institutions and towardprivate lenders and credit unions, who may not follow the federal guidelines.This is an issue that we will monitor. We are looking forward to lending data from the secondquarter, as well as the latest information from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporationabout mortgage underwriting practices, which we will receive later this year.In terms of housing market imbalances, we have also seen some lessening in this vulnerability,though it remains elevated. The annual rate of house price growth peaked in April 2017, at justunder 20 per cent on a national basis, and is now below 2 per cent. This slowdown is due to thedeclining affordability of housing in some markets, as well as the combined impact of higherinterest rates, macroeconomic policies such as the new mortgage lending guidelines, andhousing policy measures taken by various provincial governments. 1 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
Of course, that figure is a national average. Outside of Toronto, national house price growthremains above 5 per cent. A decline in prices for single-family homes in Toronto is a major factorpulling down this national average. In contrast, prices for condominiums are still growing rapidly,particularly in the greater Toronto and Vancouver areas. This is a reverse of the dynamics thatwe saw until early 2017, when price growth for condos trailed the pace for single-family homes. Itis possible that the guidelines are having an impact here by limiting the amount some buyers canborrow and increasing the demand for condos relative to single-family homes. It is also possiblethat speculative activity is helping to push prices higher.The third main vulnerability we are watching is the possibility of a major successful cyber attackon a financial institution or market infrastructure, such as the payment systems that we all rely onevery day. Given how interconnected our financial system is, there is concern that a successfulattack on one institution could have wide-ranging effects. The Bank has been working with majorbanks and Payments Canada to make sure our country’s key payment systems can recoverquickly from a successful cyber attack.Overall, when we look at the three vulnerabilities and our risk scenarios, we judge that the overalllevel of risk is roughly unchanged from November, and our financial system remains resilient.I also want to point out that in this FSR, we report the results of a survey we conducted withfinancial system participants. Respondents identified the threat of a cyber attack, geopoliticalevents and a pronounced decline in property prices as among the most important risks facingtheir firms’ own activities and the broader financial system.Before we answer your questions, I will turn it over to Senior Deputy Governor Wilkins, who willsay a few words about the Bank’s plans for communications on financial system issues.Senior Deputy Governor Wilkins:Thank you, Governor.As many of you know, for over a decade, the biannual Financial System Review has been ourmain vehicle for communicating our analysis and research on developments related to stability ofthe financial system. The financial crisis taught us, the hard way, just how important it is to keepon top of financial system risks. That’s as true today as it was then.I am pleased to tell you about some changes we are making to improve the accessibility andtimeliness of our work in this area. The first is that this autumn, we will launch the Bank ofCanada’s financial system hub on our website. The hub will offer up-to-date analysis and articleson financial system issues, presented in an engaging way and aimed at a broad audience. Thegoal is to help more Canadians better understand developments in the financial system withouthaving to wait for publication of the full FSR.The second change is that we will publish the FSR once a year, in June. This recognizes that themain vulnerabilities facing the financial system tend to evolve very slowly. As the Governor said,the top three vulnerabilities in our financial system are unchanged from the previous report, as isthe overall level of risk.The third change is that we will introduce a speech each autumn by a member of GoverningCouncil that will give an update on the Bank’s views about the evolution of the main vulnerabilitiesand risks to the financial system. This speech will draw from the analysis that is published on thehub. The concept is similar to the regular economic progress report speeches that we havebegun doing.We will also use our quarterly Monetary Policy Reports to discuss relevant financial systemissues when they have a bearing on the outlook for economic growth and inflation. The bottom 2 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
line is that we are modernizing our financial system communications, to be more nimble and togive these issues the greater visibility that they deserve.With that, Governor Poloz and I would be happy to answer your questions. 3 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches

In the MPC’s May Inflation Report we are forecasting that it will remain subdued over the forecast period. If our forecast materialises, annual growth will have been between 1¼ and 2% for five consecutive years from 2016 to 2020. To give some context, annual average GDP growth has been in this range in only eight of the 50 years before that period, and three of those were since the financial crisis.   It’s been said before but it bears repeating: the UK economy is in an unusual position.  Over the past few years, meanwhile, unemployment has fallen from a high of 8.5% to a forty year low of just 4.2%. Employment has similarly picked up to record highs. Usually you would expect faster growth to be accompanied by stronger employment growth, and vice versa (Chart 1) – an empirical fact so robust that economists know it as Okun’s Law.1 Since the financial crisis, however, this law has, if not broken down, at least started working rather differently than before. Unemployment has fallen far more, and employment growth has been far stronger, than might have been expected given the subdued pace of GDP growth  (Chart 2).   Chart 1: GDP and employment growth                                                          1 Okun, Arthur M. "Potential GNP, its measurement and significance".

     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 3  3   Chart 2: Okun’s Law and the financial crisis  Arithmetically this is accounted for by a fall in the rate of labour productivity growth. Having grown steadily for a number of decades, the level of productivity fell sharply following the financial crisis. That was in line with historical experience.2 What there is much less historical precedence for is the failure of productivity growth to recover to its pre-crisis growth rate. A cottage industry of economists – including me – have tried to explain the so-called productivity puzzle.3                                                         2 Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff (2009), “This Time is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly”. Princeton University Press 3 I set out my views in more detail in a speech in February. See: Ramsden, D. “The UK’s productivity growth challenge”, speech at Babraham Hall, Cambridge, 23 February 2018. Many other members of the MPC have also given their attention to the question – see for example: Tenreyro, S., “The fall in productivity growth: causes and implications”, speech at Queen Mary University of London,  15 January 2018; Haldane, A.

The existence of a wage Phillips Curve, its stability, its slope and its identifiability in the data are collectively one of the more contentious subject areas in economics – and for some of you my next chart (Chart 4) may not do much to persuade you of any of these. Nevertheless I think most practising economic policymakers would expect to see at least some link between falling unemployment and rising wages.4 Indeed one reason for the fall in the curve over time is arguably policymakers’ success at using that link to control inflation and bring down nominal wage expectations. At any rate, the stubborn failure of wage growth to rise much above 2% - that is, above half its pre-crisis rate – and workers’ surprising willingness to absorb that in real wages represents one more surprising feature of the British economy.                                                       4 The original observation was made in: Phillips, A. W. (1958). "The Relationship between Unemployment and the Rate of Change of Money Wages in the United Kingdom 1861-1957". Economica, 25 (100): 283–299.

     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 5  5   Chart 4: The wage Phillips Curve    I want to use my speech today to focus on the implications of the UK’s unusual economic position for inflation and for monetary policy, both in terms of what has happened over the recent past and of what I expect to happen in future. I will focus on three aspects of the economy in particular. First, the ongoing consequences of the vote to leave the EU, and what those have meant and could mean in future for monetary policy. Second, the continued evolution of the labour market and how I expect that to affect inflation and monetary policy in future. And third, developments in the economy at the start of this year: the unexpected weakness of GDP and evolution of inflation.   These aspects of the economy are unusual in terms of what they imply for the UK outlook. But as a policymaker I feel reasonably confident, even with the uncertainties, that, together with my colleagues on the MPC, I have a reasonable understanding of what’s going on, and in particular what the implications are for inflation. Let me explain why in more detail, and then conclude with where that leaves my policy thinking.  The Brexit vote  Turning first to Brexit.  The vote to leave the EU leaves the UK in a position which is not just unusual but unique. As my colleague the Governor said recently, the Brexit negotiations are the biggest challenge as well as the biggest opportunity facing the country at this moment. And the outcome of those negotiations remains the most significant influence on the economic outlook, as well as the greatest source of uncertainty about the future. As a member of the MPC, my task in the face of this uncertainty is to balance any trade-off between the speed at which inflation returns sustainably to target and supporting employment and activity, in line with our -505101520253035357911Unemployment (per cent) 1971-19971998-20122013-2017Wage growth (per cent)

What does that mean in practice?  In the MPC’s assessment, consistently held since before the referendum, Brexit is affecting the UK economy via three main channels – that is, through its effects on supply, demand and the exchange rate.  On the supply side we expect Brexit to have both a long and a short run effect on productivity.   The long run effect comes about through the effects on the UK’s openness.5 We know that on average being more open to trade makes an economy more productive. That comes about through a range of channels. For example, greater competition encourages UK firms to operate more efficiently. Access to larger export markets enables them to take more advantage of economies of scale. And the ability to trade allows the UK to specialise in sectors where it has a competitive advantage. To the extent that leaving the single market or the customs union makes it harder to do business with the EU, that will reduce the economy’s productive capacity. (Equally if leaving the EU allows the other economies to trade with and invest more openly in the UK then these same channels are likely to support UK productivity). We don’t know whether these long-run channels are already in operation. But it is possible that they have been contributing to reinforce the continued weakness of productivity growth.6  In the short run what we do know is that uncertainty about the eventual outcome of the Brexit negotiations, and perhaps the expectation that Brexit will lower economic growth over time, has been depressing business investment. Businesses are waiting for more clarity before embarking on new capital projects, and that reduces their productive capacity relative to what it could have been, as well as hampering resource  re-allocation across the economy.   We see this most clearly in business surveys. Brexit has consistently ranked at or near the top of the list of the risks identified in the Deloitte survey of Chief Financial Officers.7 In the Bank’s own quarterly Decision Makers’ Panel, around 40% of firms consistently identify Brexit as a major source of uncertainty, with less than 20% viewing it as unimportant (Chart 5). Bank staff analysis of the results points to a drag of between  3 and 4% on nominal investment growth since the referendum as a result of this uncertainty8.                                                        5 For more detail on these mechanisms, see the Box on “Factors affecting the prospects for long-term supply following the EU referendum” on pages 29-30 of the August Inflation Report. 6 It is also possible that actual or anticipated changes in institutional arrangements due to Brexit might affect the outlook for net migration and therefore population growth. 7 Specifically, it has been at the top of the list for two years, falling back for the first time to second place in Q1, with its place at the top taken by weak UK demand. 8 For more information on the Decision Maker Panel, see Bloom, N. et al (2017), “Tracking the views of British businesses: evidence from the Decision Maker Panel”, Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, 2017Q2.

In addition to its effects on investment, it has had a significant impact on real household incomes and therefore on consumption. The main vehicle for this impact has been the fall in the exchange rate, which remains some 15% below its pre-referendum peak. The rise in import prices caused by sterling’s depreciation has had a material and persistent effect on incomes: real household income has only risen by 0.2% in the seven quarters since the referendum, compared with averaged growth of over 1½ % per year in the five years prior to it (Chart 6).   Given that slowing in real income growth, you could argue that it’s surprising that households haven’t adjusted consumption even more. Consumption growth has certainly slowed: it has averaged around 0.3% per quarter since the referendum, compared to 0.6% in the previous five years and nearly 0.9% in the  pre-crisis decade. But households have also in aggregate reduced their savings – the household saving rate has fallen by some two per cent of income (Chart 7). Whether households will maintain that lower rate of saving, as in the MPC’s central forecast, remains to be seen – there must be a risk that consumption could adjust further.                                                       9 Question: “How much has the result of the EU referendum affected the level of uncertainty affecting your business?” 01020304050Not importantOne of many sources2 or 3 top sourcesTop source ofuncertaintyAug-Sep 2016Feb-Apr 2017Aug-Oct 2017Feb-Apr 2018Share of respondents (per cent)

One reason is that the fall in the exchange rate, while dampening consumption, will also have supported net trade. Another is the policy actions that were taken in response.10 In addition, demand has been helped by an unexpectedly strong global recovery, which will have boosted trade and investment, as well as by more supportive financial conditions, particularly                                                       10 The MPC’s policy package in August 2016 – which consisted of a cut in Bank Rate, the introduction of the Term Funding Scheme to ensure that that cut was passed through, and an additional £60bn of asset purchases including corporate bonds – will have provided stimulus, as will the mild loosening in the fiscal stance in the subsequent Budget. In addition, the FPC amended the leverage ratio framework for UK banks by excluding central bank reserves, cut the counter-cyclical capital buffer to zero, and emphasised that banks’ liquidity reserves are usable, while the PRA Board decided to use regulatory flexibilities to smooth insurers’ transition to new regulatory standards in a very low interest rate environment. -3-2-1012320002004200820122016Quarterly consumption growthQuarterly household income growthPer cent Referendum Dashed lines represent averages over the period 02468101220002004200820122016Per cent of income Referendum

I have already discussed its effects of the recent depreciation on demand, where it has contributed to a rotation away from consumption and towards net trade. Equally important for the MPC has been its effect on inflation.   I hardly need to remind an inflation conference that CPI inflation has overshot the MPC’s 2% target for over a year now, peaking at 3.1% last autumn. That overshoot has almost entirely reflected the effects of the depreciation. UK non-fuel import prices have risen 7% since the referendum, a direct result of the lower exchange rate. If anything that is a little less than we had been expecting based on past experience, and we revised down our inflation forecast slightly in the last Inflation Report to reflect that. But it has nevertheless been enough to generate a significant overshoot.  Why did the MPC not act to prevent that overshoot? After all, the Committee knew it was coming.   One reason is that the lags from raising Bank Rate and lowering inflation are long enough that we would have been unlikely to be able to offset the full effect of import prices. But a more substantive reason is that we were faced with a trade-off between growth and inflation.  The MPC’s remit gives us two very clear objectives. The first objective, is “to maintain price stability”, defined as an inflation target of 2%. Importantly that target is symmetric: there is no bias towards keeping inflation above or below the target. The second objective is “to support” – subject to the first – “the economic policy of Her Majesty’s Government, including its objectives for growth and employment”.  Economic situations like the one the UK has been in create a conflict between these two objectives. Monetary policy can reduce inflation, but only at the cost of reducing output and increasing unemployment. If inflation is above target and output is below potential (or vice versa), there is a fundamental trade-off between achieving the two objectives. Since 2013 the MPC’s remit has required us to manage significant trade-offs when exceptional circumstances cause them to arise. And that has been the basis for the Committee’s assessment of the UK situation since the referendum.12  To explain how our position on this has evolved, let me turn to the second unusual aspect of the economy that I want to focus on this afternoon: the UK labour market.                                                        11 For more details see Box 5, “How has the economy evolved relative to the February 2017 Report”, in the Prospects for Inflation section of the May 2018 Inflation Report. 12 For a detailed explanation see: Carney, M (2017), “Lambda”, speech at the London School of Economics, 16 January 2017. 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 10  10   The labour market  I said at the start of this speech that wage growth has been surprisingly weak. That wasn’t a figure of speech. This chart (Chart 8) shows the MPC’s wage growth forecasts from the past few years against the actual data. As you can see, the MPC have been consistently surprised by the continued weakness of wage growth.  Chart 8: MPC wage forecasts   Why have wages been so persistently weak?  One reason is weak productivity growth. How much companies are prepared to pay their workers depends ultimately on how much those workers are able to produce. Weaker productivity has meant weaker wage growth.   But wages were weak even relative to productivity. Statistical models that take account of the effects of slack and productivity struggled to explain the full extent of the weakness in wages. “Missing wage inflation” and the question of whether the Phillips curve was dead became a hot topic among economists. As with the productivity puzzle itself, there are a wide range of candidate explanations for this “wage puzzle”. I won’t go through the full list now. But I do just want to mention three that I find relevant.  One candidate explanation is that there may be lags between unemployment falling and wage growth starting to pick up. That might be the case for instance if wage expectations take time to adjust to a tighter labour market – any lasting effect of the post-crisis downward nominal wage rigidity should have worn off, but could re-emerge if 2% wage inflation has become accepted as more typical following the financial crisis. Or it -10123452012201320142015201620172018February 2014February 2015February 2016February 2017February 2018May 2018Total pay growth, per cent 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 11  11   might be that pay initially only rises for workers moving jobs, and that pay for workers staying in the same job doesn’t pick up until the stock of unemployment workers is used up. That would be consistent the fact that pay growth for “switchers” has recovered by much more than pay growth for “stayers” (Chart 9). In the more recent period it might be that this is another effect of Brexit: as I argued last autumn, workers might have responded to uncertainties about the outlook by showing even more flexibility in their wage demands, or employers might be acting in a more precautionary way.   Chart 9: Pay growth for “switchers” and “stayers”  This chart contains statistical data from ONS which is Crown Copyright. The use of the ONS statistical data in this work does not imply the endorsement of the ONS in relation to the interpretation or analysis of the statistical data. This work uses research datasets which may not exactly reproduce National Statistics aggregates.  A second explanation would be if technological or other developments have reduced individual workers’ bargaining power. This would be a continuation of a long run trend rather than a development specific to the financial crisis. It would be consistent with those studies which find a longer-term flattening of the Phillips Curve that predates the crisis. But it might have intensified with the “Uberisation” of, and other influences on, the UK labour market, which may have left workers more atomised. Greater contestability across international labour markets and the greater integration of the global labour pool would also fall into this category.13  Finally, a third explanation would be that headline unemployment might be understating the amount of slack left in the labour market. At the same time as actual unemployment has been falling, there have been a number of structural changes in the labour market that are likely to have shifted the equilibrium                                                       13 For more detail, see: Carney, M (2017), “[De]Globalisation and inflation”, 2017 IMF Michel Camdessus Central Banking Lecture, 18 September 2017. 024681012200120032005200720092011201320152017Workers moving jobsWorkers staying in jobsMedian pay rise, per cent

For example, higher educational attainment, increased use of online job advertising, and increased flexibility in the labour market are likely to have increased matching efficiency and lowered job destruction rates. That would have been consistent with the fact that broader measures of domestically generated inflation also remained below levels that would be consistent with inflation at target in the medium term.  The idea that there was more slack than headline measures of unemployment were suggesting was one that I put particular weight on when I started on the MPC last autumn – in other words that there was more room for the economy to grow without generating inflation above target in the medium term. That was one reason why I voted (in the minority) for no change at the November policy meeting.14  During the MPC’s annual supply stocktake in February we made a judgement to revise our estimate of the economy’s equilibrium unemployment rate from 4½% to 4¼%: in other words, a judgement that there was indeed some more slack in the labour market. That left me more comfortable with the balance of risks around the MPC’s central assumptions than I had been previously.  At the same time, by the February Inflation Report, annual wage growth in the data had picked up materially relative to what we had been expecting at the November meeting. In November the most recent observation for whole economy regular pay had been of just 2.1% growth (in August). And we were forecasting it to only pick up very slightly over the next six months. But by the February Report it had picked up to 2.4% growth (in November) and we were forecasting a further pick-up to 2.8% over the next few months. That was corroborated by our Agents’ pay survey which was pointing to a ½ percentage point increase in settlements this year, from around 2½% to around 3%, with the ability to recruit and retain staff the number one factor driving growth.  Since February the picture has remained the same. Wages did indeed pick up to 2.8% by the May Inflation report. And the very latest observation, of 2.9% regular pay growth in March, was slightly higher than our expectation even in May. Wage growth has now been rising steadily over the past six months, and unit labour costs have been rising towards growth rates consistent with overall inflation at target.  The period of unusually subdued growth in wages appears to be coming to an end.   The year so far  That brings me to the third unusual situation that that we have had to contend with – developments in the economy so far this year, and how the MPC have responded to them – most recently at our May policy meeting. At the time of the February report we judged that the trade-off between managing slack and controlling inflation was much diminished. We went so far as to say that “were the economy to evolve broadly in line with the February Inflation Report projections, monetary policy would need to be tightened somewhat                                                       14 See: Ramsden, D (2017), “Monetary Policy from End to End: Define, Decide, Deliver”, speech at King’s College London, 20 November 2017. 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 13  13   earlier and by a somewhat greater extent over the forecast period than anticipated at the time of the November Report”. Given that, why didn’t we vote in May to raise Bank Rate?  The key thing to note here is the dependence on the data. Did the economy evolve broadly in line with our February projections?  The simple answer to that question is no. Instead from early April we were faced with a string of much less encouraging data for the early part of the year. The March PMIs fell sharply and only partially reversed in April. Inflation surprised on the downside. GDP growth in Q1 was 0.1%. Consumer confidence fell. And consumer credit growth slowed sharply in March.   Of course as always with data, there were more layers to the story. Most importantly, our staff analysis suggested the low GDP growth figure was likely to be heavily influenced by the bad weather we had in March. That was partly because the weather is likely to have had a dampening effect on activity – and the pattern of activity was consistent with this. And partly because GDP is typically revised up more than usual after periods of heavy snow: this chart (Chart 10) illustrates the size of revisions in previous periods of snow. From an economic perspective it was also hard to find other factors that could have contributed to such a sharp slowdown: the world economy had continued to grow, and financial conditions had remained accommodative.  Chart 10: Snow effects on GDP revisions   At the same time, the labour market continued to perform robustly. Employment continued to rise, which – given its correlation with GDP, which if anything has become more contemporaneous in recent years – would 2009 Q4 2010 Q1 2010 Q4 2013 Q1 -0.6-0.4-0.20.00.20.40.60.8Preliminary estimateLatest estimatePercentage changes on a quarter earlier 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 14  14   suggest all else equal that GDP was also growing. Underlying regular pay growth continued to pick up in line with our forecasts.   Given all this, it seemed to me and to the MPC that the most likely explanation for the apparent weak data in the run up to our May meeting was that it was a temporary, weather-related softening. And we continued to see the trade-off between slack and inflation as much diminished. In fact last month as part of our continuing efforts to make our thinking more transparent, we published our estimate of excess supply (or slack) in the economy for the first time. If you look it up in the Report you will see that according to our estimate only a very small amount of excess supply – ¼% of GDP – remained in the economy.  But we couldn’t be certain of this. Even in the most benign interpretation the economy had gone through a temporary soft patch. The majority of indicators were pointing in one direction. And it felt like there was at least a risk that, perhaps reflecting the unusual position of the UK, something more material was going on – perhaps one of the risks I highlighted earlier was crystallising. That was why I, along with the majority of the Committee, decided to vote again to leave Bank Rate unchanged.  How do I see the economy evolving from here?  It is still early days. We are still only two thirds of the way through Q2, less far through the Q2 data cycle, and only a month has passed since our last MPC meeting. Even so, the data we have had so far suggests our interpretation of the slowdown in Q1 as temporary looks to be being borne out. Consumer confidence and consumer credit both picked up in the latest data, as did retail sales and several business surveys. That included the latest services PMI output balance, representing 80% of the economy. So far at least our May judgement looks on track.   Looking ahead, my central expectation for the economy is in line with the MPC’s best collective judgement as expressed in our inflation report forecasts. Global growth still looks solid, albeit a bit less rosy than it did before. The labour market is still robust. I expect GDP growth to resume at a steady but unspectacular pace (Chart 11), and demand to continue to rotate away from consumption and towards trade and investment. Of course all this is conditional on a smooth transition to the eventual post-Brexit arrangements.

Unemployment falls to 4%, below our estimate of equilibrium, and a small margin of excess demand opens up. And so we expect wage growth and domestic inflationary pressures to continue the pickup we saw at the end of last year (Chart 12): wage growth eventually picks up to 3½% – which given our productivity growth forecast implies unit wage cost growth of 2¼%.   Chart 12: Measures of domestically generated inflation  This is an important thing to bear in mind when looking at the current wage data. Before the financial crisis we were invariably in a “two plus two is four” world, with two per cent productivity growth and two per cent -0.500.511.522.533.520132015201720192021Per cent 0.00.51.01.52.02.53.0Services CPIServices PPIUnit labourcostsPrivate sectorULCsUnit wagecostsGVA deflatorexcludinggovernmentGDP deflator2017 Q32017 Q4Per cent 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 16  16   inflation yielding four per cent wage growth at least. Today we seem to be in more of a “one plus two is three” world: given one per cent productivity growth, wage growth only needs to reach three per cent, not four, to be consistent with the two per cent target. In our central forecast wage growth achieves that. And so although imported inflation falls back as the upward pressure from sterling’s depreciation comes to an end, domestic cost pressures keep inflation close to target in the medium term.   Relative to this central forecast I can see risks in both directions. I have already mentioned the possibility that consumption growth might take a further leg down as households continue to adjust to lower real incomes. In that case GDP growth would be lower, spare capacity could open up and inflation could drop below target. But there are also risks from the supply side. On the one hand, productivity growth has serially disappointed and could continue to do so in future. In that case excess demand could build more quickly and inflation could stay above target. That said, I am optimistic about the potential for Fintech and other new technologies to lead to productivity gains, either directly or by driving competition, and in turn to potentially higher, and non-inflationary, wage growth.15   One thing to emphasise about our central forecast is that it is conditional on the market yield curve. At the time of the May Inflation Report that yield curve was pricing in roughly three rate rises over the three years covered by our forecast. And those three rate rises were one of the forces preventing excess demand rising faster in the forecast and inflation from remaining persistently above target.   To demonstrate what would happen without those rate rises, we also publish a version of the forecast in the Inflation Report showing what would happen if Bank Rate remained unchanged (Chart 13). In that version of the forecast inflation does not fall back to target. Instead excess demand and domestic cost pressures build much more rapidly. And so inflation stays persistently at around 2.4%, little changed from where it is now and materially above our inflation target.                                                       15 I set out my views on the opportunities presented by Fintech in a speech in March – see: Ramsden, D (2018), “The Bank of England – Open to Fintech”, speech at HMT’s International Finance Conference, London, 22 March 2018. 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 17  17   Chart 13: May IR central inflation forecast   This does not seem a desirable outcome. Inflation persistently above target and a sustained period of excess demand would represent a failure to meet our remit. This is one of the reasons why I signed up to the Committee’s collective judgement that “were the economy to develop broadly in line with the May Inflation Report projections, an ongoing tightening of monetary policy over the forecast period would be appropriate to return inflation sustainably to its target at a conventional horizon”.   Despite the backdrop of uncertainty, and despite the unusual things going on in the economy, I am actually reasonably confident about our understanding of what’s going on. Forecasts are never going to be perfectly accurate. But over the last year I think we have got the broad narrative, and our understanding of the key moving parts, about right, with the slowing in GDP growth, the rotation of demand and the overshoot in inflation.16 Students of the UK labour market – and I have been one for over thirty years – should always expect surprises. But I feel my knowledge of what’s going on has developed over the last year. And, lastly, while it is still early days, our judgements on the behaviour of the economy so far in 2018, and the effects of the snow, appear to have been borne out.  Nevertheless, our view of the outlook and the prescription for monetary policy remains conditional on the data, how they evolve and what pointers they give to the future. It is likely that supply, demand and the exchange rate will continue to move around as Brexit negotiations progress and external conditions change.17 And the data and the outlook will change to reflect all of these.                                                        16 Again, for more details see Box 5, “How has the economy evolved relative to the February 2017 Report”, in the Prospects for Inflation section of the May 2018 Inflation Report. In fact inflation overshot by a little more than we had expected, partly reflecting the rise in oil prices over the previous year, demand rotated by a greater degree than we had expected, and productivity growth slowed by more than we had expected. And, as discussed above, demand fell back by less than we had initially predicted in the August 2016 Inflation Report. But the broad shape of the economic response to Brexit was in line with what we had forecast in February 2017.  -0.500.511.522.533.520132015201720192021Policy following market ratesNo change in Bank RatePer cent

1  “Post-MoU Greece: Five proposals” Speech by Professor John (Iannis) Mourmouras  Bank of Greece Deputy Governor Former Deputy Finance Minister at the 2nd International Conference organised by the Economic Chamber of Greece at the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center Athens, 31 May 2018  Your Excellency, Mr. President of the Hellenic Republic, Ladies and Gentlemen,   Introduction  After 8 years of hardship and thanks, on the one hand, to the big sacrifices of the Greek people and, on the other hand, to the solidarity of our European partners as this is manifested by the unprecedented amount of loans given to our country on truly concessional terms (very low rates and long maturities), Greece is finally coming out of the tunnel with optimism. Although the international economic environment and indeed the situation in our neighbourhood is pretty unstable right now, I believe the Greek case is manageable for an exit from the MoUs in late August without a precautionary credit line – which would be effectively a mini-fourth MoU. Such an exit, after all, would be similar to the cases of Portugal, Ireland and Cyprus. I will seize the opportunity of this conference organised by the Economic Chamber of Greece, thriving under the leadership of Konstantinos Kollias, taking place in this magnificent masterpiece of world architecture named after a global business leader, Stavros Niarchos, to make 4 new proposals, and repeat an old one, towards achieving this sort of exit and beyond, and the emphasis is on the “beyond”. Then I will briefly ask what went wrong in the case of Greece. I have written extensively on this subject during the period 2010-2014 with my previous hats, including the professorial one. The important thing is to look forward, but history matters and the lessons drawn with regard to member countries of monetary unions are of paramount importance. And finally I will look at the significant role that the ECB played in the adjustment programmes in the four countries and, more generally, in the South of Europe (including Spain and Italy), among other things in providing liquidity and effectively saving the euro, because, as you know, that was at stake in the end.  Before coming to the main topic of my speech, five proposals on post-MoU Greece, a digression may be in order on Italy.  
2  Italy What’s happening in Italy right now is not a surprise for some. For a lot of analysts it has the potential to trigger the next global financial crisis after 2008, markets’ first reaction was really dramatic, although the following days they seem to be calming down a bit. US and European equity markets fell by around 2% on the very first day, the Italian 2-year government bond rose by 230 basis points, the Italian 10-year government bond rose by 70 basis points, a trend not seen since the euro area crisis in 2012 and dragging down all other europeriphery government bonds. The unstable political situation caused by populists, which has left the country without a government since March, goes back to two major root causes. First of all, it may be attributed to the failure of globalisation to reach some segments of the population, which have been left behind in terms of its economic benefits, for instance through chronic unemployment of around 11%, with youth unemployment at a devastating 35%. Italy’s per capita income is lower today than on the eve of the country’s euro adoption in 1999 and over the past decade, the country has experienced a triple-dip recession. It is expected to be at the bottom of the euro area’s growth league this year. It is no wonder that the 5 Star movement won more than 50% of votes in the troubled south, where poverty rates have increased by half since the crisis.Secondly, increased migration flows in the last three years, triggered a strong anti-European sentiment and broader support for populist forces.  Italy is too big to ignore. Its GDP is 10 times bigger than the Greek one. Italy is the eurozone’s third-largest economy and it has systemic importance to the world economy. Italy has the world’s third largest sovereign debt market, after the US and Japan, with total public debt of more than €2.3 trillion, of which more than 36% is held by foreigners, so contagion is really an issue here. It also has the worst public debt-to-GDP ratio (133%) in the eurozone after Greece and a weak banking system, poorly capitalised, troubled also by the high level of non-performing loans (more than €250 billion, 15% of the total). No matter what happens with the current political and constitutional crisis in Italy, the problem with Italy was there: life after QE, namely what happens with the end of QE this year when the ECB will stop its large-scale purchases of Italian government bonds. I don’t want to think what would be happening if political developments were to lead Italy to lose its investment grade (currently at BBB). A. Greece today and beyond  A.1 The real economy: positive short and medium-term outlook Greece’s economic recovery is finally gaining traction after an unprecedented depression. Real GDP in 2017 increased by 1.4% with positive contributions from exports of goods and services (2 percentage points contribution) and gross fixed capital formation (1.2 percentage points contribution) (see Chart 1). This positive outcome creates a strong carryover effect of +0.5% for GDP growth in 2018, which supports the outlook for a GDP growth rate of around 2% and 2.5% in 2018 and 2019, respectively. 
3   Figure 1 Growth has resumed   Positive developments are not only reflected in economic activity indicators, but also in soft data such as the manufacturing PMI which has been in expansionary territory for the last ten months, by far the longest period since 2007. Economic sentiment has been on an upward trend since mid-2015, reached a 3-year high in 2017 and further improved in the first quarter of 2018. Industrial production has been expanding at healthy rates since mid-2015 and performed exceptionally well in 2017. The unemployment rate dropped to 21% in 2017, falling by around 6 percentage points from its peak in 2013. This trend continued in the first four months of 2018, which supports the outlook for an unemployment rate of around 19% and 18% in 2018 and 2019 respectively. Employment increased by 2.2% in 2017, and the number of unemployed declined by 9.2%, while the youth unemployment rate (in the 20-29 age category) declined to 35% in 2017 from 38% in 2016, and long-term unemployment also dropped by 3 percentage points (see Figure 2).     
4  Figure 2 Total, youth unemployment rate and share of the long-term unemployed (in percentages)  Source: ELSTAT, Labour Force Survey.  The Greek banking sector is strengthening Turning now to the Greek banking sector, first allow me to make some comments in the wake of the stress test results. All four systemic banks successfully concluded the 2018 stress test conducted by the ECB, pointing to no capital shortfall. Therefore, for the first time since 2010 and after three rounds of capital injections in the last five years, the Greek banks will not need additional capital in the near future. More analytically, the tests revealed a 9 percentage point impact on banks CET1 ratio under the adverse scenario, equivalent to €15.5 billion, but left all banks’ CET1 higher than the 5.5% implicit hurdle (although one bank is relatively close and is expected to continue its current capital plan).   Moreover, the continued improvement in the banking sector can also be seen on their reduced reliance on the central bank funding, which is diminishing steadily and is now below the levels of end-2014 (see Figure 3).    
5  Figure 3 Bank deposits and reliance on central bank funding (Q1 2008 to end-February 2018)   Banks’ dependence on the ELA emergency lifeline has declined significantly to around €8.6 billion during this month, from €70 billion at the end of 2015 and is expected to be terminated before the end of the year. Another visible improvement in the Greek banking sector was the increase of the total deposits between end-June 2015 and March 2018 by €13 billion (or 8.0%) to €143 billion.  Last but not least, a major pending issue is the tackling of the problem posed by the high stock of non-performing loans, the ‘Achilles heel’ of the Greek banking system.  On a positive note, for the first time since 2014, net NPEs follow a downward trend. However, the NPE ratio of 42% in Greece remains the highest across euro area countries, against 14% in Portugal and 10% in Italy and Ireland (see Figure 4), while before the crisis the NPL ratio in Greece was 4.5% (in 2007), against 3% for the euro area average.   
6  Figure 4 Ratio of non-performing exposures (NPE ratio) in the euro area (December 2017)  Source: European Banking Authority (2018), “Risk Dashboard, data as of Q4 2017”.  A.2 Post-MoU Greece: the way forward  First of all, as shown in the following table, Greece has outperformed – with the exception of NPEs and public debt, in terms of all other macroeconomic indices – i.e. in terms of growth, primary and fiscal surplus, current account surplus, the spread of Greek bonds vs. the German Bund – the other 3 countries during the corresponding exit periods. This is obviously comforting to both our lenders and the markets for the future of Greece after the MoUs.   Table 1  Source: Bank of Greece.

7   I intend to skip here the latest heated debate on cash buffers vs. a precautionary credit line, for 2 reasons. Firstly, they are both short-term solutions, maximum one plus one year, but the real question remains what comes next after the first post MoU-year. This is the question I propose to focus on, namely: what needs to be done in order for the country to achieve a permanent sustainable return to the capital markets, like the pre-2008 status. It will be the sequel question to either cash buffer or precautionary credit line the country will inevitably have to face in a year or so. I want to open this debate from here today by making a number of proposals that will make such a return feasible in the foreseeable future. Secondly, this economic debate has turned into a saga, it’s a politically controversial issue, as it is quite often the case in Greece, some have called it ‘sour grapes’ – and I don’t want to go into that territory. The truth of the matter is that we have in our hands a Eurogroup decision of 15 June 2017, which is an agreement between the government and our lenders in view of the ending of the current programme in August 2018 and I quote: “Europe commits to provide support for Greece’s return to the market …” and “to further build up cash buffers to support investors’ confidence and facilitate market access”.  Right now we have this agreement. If this changes, we are here to discuss it.  Before coming to my proposals, let me list a number of undeniable facts about post-MoU Greece: 1. The fourth and final programme review has been concluded successfully last week. So the last disbursement from the ESM is only a matter of time and, as of today, there will be no extension of the third adjustment programme, which ends on 20 August later this year. 2. Any prior actions left will be dealt with during the post-MoU period, known as the Post-Programme Surveillance (PPS). We know the name, but not what it will entail. This is the big known-unknown today, be patient and we will know all about it in a few weeks’ time.  3. What is clear, however, have no doubt about it, is that Greece will be exiting the 3rd MoU, but will be entering something new, not a 4th MoU, but something hybrid with conditionality since debt relief, according to all evidence, will be given in tranches.  4. Finally, it seems that austerity will stay with us at least for another 4 years as primary surpluses of 3.5% are required until 2022.   Before turning to my own proposals for Greece, one word about the IMF. It is not clear yet what role the IMF holds for itself. Any IMF decision about its future role will be fully respected. There is a proposal already, which I endorse, that Greece’s remaining loan obligation to the IMF of €10 billion which comes at a gross interest rate of 3.8%, much higher than European loans interest rate of about 1%, should be repaid immediately (the money can be found). Such an early repayment of the IMF loan would contribute to an improvement of the 
8  sustainability of public debt, making also possible a more balanced management of payments.  Figure 5 Greece public sector outstanding debt (in billion euro)  Sources: HSBC and Greek Public Debt Management Authority (PDMA), January 2018.  Then all past grave mistakes by the IMF (e.g. on the value of fiscal multipliers, assumed at 0.5, when the correct value was 1.5), the over-optimistic forecasts about growth and fiscal surpluses under the 1st MoU, turned into over-pessimistic forecasts under the 3rd MoU, etc. and the most recent ones, like e.g. that the Greek banks will need at least €10 billion capital injection as a result of the 2018 stress tests, will be “all forgiven and forgotten”, as they say.  Of course, a key prerequisite for a permanent return to the capital markets is the sustainable recovery of the Greek economy with growth levels of above 2%. On top of that and from my point of view, the following four proposals are also required:  Proposal #1: Further increasing the cash buffer  The government’s strategy - agreed with our lenders - makes sense: to fully cover the country’s financing needs for the first post-MoU period. This is after all what all the other three countries did. For instance, in the case of Ireland, it was a cash buffer of €25 billion, in Portugal it was around €20 billion, in both cases around 13% of their GDP. Greece’s gross financing needs for the next two years amount to €45 billion, of which €18 billion will be covered by the primary surplus and the privatisation agenda, and there is an existing cash buffer already from the 2018 debt issues and from repos.  My personal view is that due to:  a) adverse capital market conditions globally, the return of volatility and higher oil prices, inverted US yield curves as a result of monetary policy tightening, the widening Libor-OIS spreads, which exert pressure on the US dollar money market, the recent US dollar strength vis-à-vis other main currencies. All the above might have a greater impact on vulnerable countries with low credit ratings and weaker economies. Name it, Italy as described above or Trump’s trade war with China and other major economies, the fog of uncertainty has thickened.  
9  b) Also due to political developments in Greece as next year will be the year of European elections and also national and regional elections. Plus there are also geopolitical risks in our neighbourhood (our unpredictable eastern neighbour in connection with the drilling of gas in the Aegean and Cyprus).  All the above make a strong case for increasing the buffer as much as possible for shielding the economy. Large cash buffers boosted investor confidence and have aided market re-entry in Ireland, Portugal and Cyprus. The extra money could come from either the bank recapitalisation amount remaining from the 3rd programme, or from new issues in the markets over the next 3 months, provided that the dust in capital markets settles down.   If things turn nasty in Italy and the europeriphery, in the next few weeks, there is plenty of time for the Greek government to negotiate with our European partners, a negotiation which I would suggest to be made at the highest level, at Prime Minister level, for Greece to exhaust all the remaining amount, which is more than €25 billion, from the €86 billion of the 3rd programme, leaving not even a single euro in the account. This amount has already been approved by the national parliaments in eurozone countries, if we face an extraordinary situation due to external factors, it is only prudent for Greece and our lenders to secure the maximum reserve amount for a rainy day in order to shield the country. There is still plenty of time for the government to look at this. Just keep a cool head!  Proposal #2:  From debt sustainability… to obtaining the investment grade for Greek public debt  We have every confidence that our lenders will keep their word on providing Greece with further debt relief - pacta sunt servanda applies to both lenders and borrowers - and deliver on what they promised since November 2012. The debt relief measures described in the Eurogroup statement of 15 June 2017 need to be clarified and specified with a clear timetable to be considered credible by investors. It will be along the lines of the 1st package of short-run measures, i.e. extending maturities and lowering interest rates which, given the new debt metric “gross financing needs below 15% of GDP for the medium term and below 20% of GDP thereafter” would make sure that the Greek public debt is sustainable. The new debt metric that focuses on gross financing needs (GFNS) – rather than the old one of nominal debt-to-GDP ratio – captures adequately the concessional terms of loans to Greece by the EFSF and the ESM (more than €180 billion with maturities up to 32.5 years and a fixed rate close to 2% directly or indirectly taking as a basis a near-zero borrowing rate from the markets by the ESM). Reducing public debt in present value terms puts the profile of Greek debt in an advantageous position among two thirds of eurozone countries and four fifths of EU countries.   With the end of the programme in August and the specification of debt relief measures in June or July Eurogroup meetings, and a positive DSA report – I 
10  open brackets here (recalling that “the one who pays the piper calls the tune”, the ESM from which we borrowed more than €180 billion as of today naturally prepares a debt sustainability analysis (DSA), which will most likely be signed by Dr. Strauch, Chief Economist of the ESM, whom we have the pleasure to have with us today – close brackets) one should normally expect at least a two-notch improvement in the country’s credit ratings by the relevant agencies. This would still be far from the investment grade of BBB-, but, here is my proposal: a new advisory Task Force with senior figures from the Public Debt Management Agency (PDMA), the General Accounting Office and the Bank of Greece, headed by an established figure with an international reputation, would join forces to help obtain the investment grade asap by lobbying the analysts, making roadshows abroad to investors, etc. Clearly, with the permanent removal of the capital controls (I’ll say more on this in a minute) and the elimination of ELA at the end of the year for our commercial banks, that would give another notch up in ratings, plus perhaps an overshooting of the target primary surplus - first evidence from Q1 suggest that this may reach 5% of GDP this year (from a target of 3.5%) and/or a better-than-expected growth performance due say to another record of tourist arrivals, etc. Then, the investment grade may be within reach during the next 12 months or so. I dare say this: For the country to move forward and avoid setbacks in the future, the importance of getting the investment grade in a reasonable time ahead is as important as meeting the Maastricht nominal criteria was in the 1990s, prior to Greece’s entry in the eurozone. We managed to do so then with a delay of two years. It may sound a bit optimistic today, but my motivation is to open up the discussion on this and make it a central part of the policy debate in post-MoU Greece. I believe it is feasible, and it is only fair for the country.  Proposal #3: Greece’s participation in the ECB’s QE programme during the re-investment period  With 3-4 notches up in the next 8 to 12 months and the investment grade for Greece within reach, the ECB may potentially examine the purchase of Greek government bonds under its public sector purchase programme during the reinvestment period, which will last for at least two years (end-2020).   Even though the potential purchase volumes of Greek debt today (around €3-4 billion) under the ECB’s asset purchase programme cannot be compared with those of Portugal, currently around €33 billion or Ireland’s €27 billion, yet, Greece’s inclusion in the ECB’s QE programme would yield a major boost in terms of confidence and send a positive signal to investors that Greece is not anymore an outlier, it is included in President Draghi’s umbrella with clear benefits in terms of the cost of borrowing of both sovereign and bank and corporate debt, as it was the case for post-MoU Ireland and Portugal. Note that if, as part of the upcoming debt relief measures, there will be a buy-out of ANFAs and SMP bonds by the ESM, releasing a total amount of €13 billion, then the volume potentially to be purchased under the QE programme could 
11  increase to €16 billion, which is more than one third of marketable debt, triggering a drop of even 150 basis points in the secondary market. We bought at the Bank of Greece - more than €50 billion - as part of QE, mainly supranational, hopefully the time of buying also GGBs is also near.  Proposal #4: Towards a permanent lifting of capital controls  No return to the markets can be permanent and hence credible with capital controls still imposed on the economy. The government, in cooperation with the Bank of Greece would have sooner than later, and definitely close to the end of the programme, publish a roadmap detailing the specific measures and set dates for the full lifting of capital controls, signalling also the end-date. This would be the catalyst for the full recovery of trust of depositors and the return of around €20 billion hoarded in mattresses and safety deposits, but also boost investor confidence in the prospects of the economy.   B. What went wrong in Greece?  Let me now turn briefly to the four adjustment programmes that took place in the eurozone, by focusing on the question “what went wrong in Greece”. The distinguished panellists of the previous session have debated at length and elaborated on the very significant question of their countries’ experiences with adjustment programmes. The Table below summarises a number of characteristics of these programmes in the europeriphery (see Table 2).  Table 2 Overview of the Financial Assistance Programmes in Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Cyprus  Source: Bank of Greece.  With a naked eye, one can see in the following table that Greece has received about €240 billion from all three programmes up to now, while the other countries have received much lower amounts, Ireland €67.5 billion, Portugal CountryType of CrisisDate of approvalDate of expirationAmount in  € (bn)EFSF/ESM LoansWeighted Average maturity Review Average Duration Number of governments Capital Controls Type of ExitGreeceSovereign Debt/CompetitivenessMay 2010August 2018110 (52,9+20,7)+172,6 (141,8+11,6)+86(40,2)30,26,75From June 2015IrelandBanking/Real Estate BubbleDecember 2010December 201367,520,83,02No"Clean" (Post-programme surveillance without precautionary credit line)PortugalSovereign Debt/CompetitivenessMay 2011June 201478 (50,3+26,5)20,83,42No"Clean" (Post-programme surveillance without precautionary credit line)CyprusBanking April 2013March 201610 (6,3+1)14,94,91From April 2013 to April 2015"Clean" (Post-programme surveillance without precautionary credit line)Overview of the Financial Assistance Programmes in Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Cyprus

While it is widely believed that the euro area crisis started from Greece, incidentally the first sign of crisis within the euro area appeared in Ireland after Bear Sterns was rescued in March 2008, whereby Irish sovereign spreads started to diverge noticeably. Nine months later, in December 2009, there was heightened pressure on GGBs. Greece was the first country though within the euro area to sign a financial assistance programme, and unfortunately the last one to exit from such a programme.  Figure 6 Ten-year government bond yields in euro area crisis countries vis-à-vis German Bund yields (September 2008-December 2014, in percentage points)  Source: Haver Analytics.  During this period, Greece experienced a dramatic fall in output (more than 25%), the unemployment ratio almost tripled from 9% in 208 to 26% in 2015, a huge fall in the standards of living and valuations of assets (real and financial) and another mountain of private debt had been built up (around €220 billion in 7 years). So, what went wrong in Greece? There are several reasons for this, let me name just a few: the starting-point argument (a huge deficit that required a bold adjustment effort); errors in the design of the programme that include the mix of adjustment measures (a greater reliance on tax increases than public spending cuts), the value of fiscal multipliers that we show above, etc., the slow pace of implementation of structural reforms (due to a lack of programme ownership on behalf of Greek authorities); the fact that Greece is a relatively closed economy and, hence, internal devaluation may contribute negatively, in net terms, to economic activity, the fact that debt restructuring in 2012 should have occurred much sooner, i.e. at the beginning of the first MoU in 2010, a directionless economic governance in the first half of 2015 and the ensuing huge cost of the economy’s backtracking, we lost valuable time then, which led to the imposition of capital controls, a severe distortion upon the economy; the wrong sequencing of reforms: product market reforms should come first, followed by labour market reforms, the exact opposite took place in Greece (Hardouvelis).  On top of the above reasons which are more or less commonly accepted, I would add a couple of other - rather technical and more subtle - reasons and 
13  this is my contribution to the relevant debate. Firstly, as we know, fiscal consolidation took place through the targeting of a nominal variable, i.e. the overall fiscal deficit which is cyclical. Taking permanent austerity measures to reduce the cyclical deficit only deepens and prolongs a recession, it results in excessive austerity and overtaxation which is self-defeating (it raises less government revenues). Instead, the structural deficit should be the appropriate target variable, and the cyclical deficit would correct itself through the economy’s automatic fiscal stabilisers, provided that growth-enhancing measures supplement fiscal consolidation (Mourmouras, FT, 2012). Secondly, there is a certain misperception in the MoUs about how reforms would work in the economy. I identify two grey areas here: (i) reforms take time to unlock their growth potential and their results are also country-specific. A recent study by the OECD (2014) indicates that the above time period may extend to five years or more; (ii) structural reforms work better and quicker when there is investment to capitalise on them and, more generally, demand in the economy because the more the recession lingers on, the harder it is to achieve positive results by implementing structural reforms. Such a demand element can be incorporated into an adjustment programme in monetary unions through the adoption of a broader concept of conditionality, namely that of investment conditionality, along with fiscal and structural conditionalities (Mourmouras, WSJ, 2012).  These are important lessons to be drawn from the Greek experience, and hopefully this will be taken into account in the design and implementation of future adjustment programmes in monetary unions.  Truly, in the last year or so, we have witnessed a revival of the Greek economy through the stabilisation of expectations and the gradual restoration of confidence. Looking forward now, we all agree that given the prolonged fiscal consolidation and private disinvestment that took place (2007: investment was 27% of GDP, today it is 11% of GDP, the lowest level since 1960), the country needs an investment shock. Reviving domestic and foreign investment is crucial to supporting the economic recovery. That is why it is important for the government to speed up the privatisation agenda, not so much as a revenue exercise, but as a great opportunity to attract FDI in key sectors of the economy, such as transport, energy, logistics and tourism.  In this respect, let me come back to an old proposal of mine, as my fifth proposal today, made back in the summer of 2014, before joining the Central Bank (see Mourmouras, The Double Crisis – Volume 2, Chapter 18: first of all, we should all agree on the limits of overtaxation. For instance, with regard to corporate taxation in Greece, 29% corporate tax (plus a 10% tax on dividends), tax competition from other countries is very intense, e.g. from the Iberian peninsula with an average tax rate of 20% (Spain and Portugal), the Baltic countries with an average tax rate of 15% (Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia) and the Balkans with an average of 10% (Turkey 20%, Romania 20%, Albania 15%, Cyprus 12.5%, Bulgaria 10% and FYROM 10%). Hence, there is a strong case 
14  to be made in Greece in favour of a drastic gradual reduction of corporate tax rates starting in 2020, but to be announced fairly soon, ultimately reaching a flat tax rate of 15% and remain locked at the same level for another five years. The drastic reduction in corporate tax rates and the commitment to leave them unchanged for a period of five years will be the best signal to Greek and foreign investors that the Greek authorities are now seeking to change the country’s growth paradigm and move towards a dynamic economy based on private investment and exports.  This drop in taxes could be financed by the fiscal space achieved through a decrease in primary surpluses, say, to 2.5% from 2020 onwards, bringing effectively forward a year or two the agreed-with-our-lenders lower primary surpluses, or from a persistent overshooting of agreed surplus targets of 3.5% of GDP until 2022.  Much to my delight, the above proposal that links lower corporate taxes to lower primary surpluses has been adopted by the Bank of Greece in May 2016 and by the main opposition leader at DETH in Thessaloniki in September 2016.  C. The role of the ECB in countries under adjustment programmes  As the euro area crisis was triggered by either a weak fiscal position in some cases or a weak banking system in others, it led to the “negative feedback loop” between banks and sovereigns, which the ECB emerged as the institution best equipped to tackle. It has used all the appropriate instruments at its disposal in order to ensure its primary priorities: price and financial stability across the euro area.  C.1 The role of the ECB on price stability 1. Reducing base rates First of all, and since the emerging of the financial crisis in 2008, the ECB has reduced its main refinancing rate from 4.25% to 0%, the largest cut ever decided over such a short period in Europe, and also brought the interest rate paid on banks’ deposits of excess reserves with the Eurosystem to negative territory, -0.40% today.  2. SMP programme Furthermore, as sovereign bond markets in some euro area jurisdictions were becoming increasingly dysfunctional, in May 2010 the ECB approved the Securities Market Programme (SMP) worth €210 billion. Its main effect was to cut refinancing costs for countries whose bonds were sold at unsustainable interest rates on international markets, leaving at the same time the money supply unchanged through sterilisation.    
15  3. LTROs and TLTROs In December 2011, the ECB revived the longer-term refinancing instrument making the central bank liquidity available to banks for up to three years at a fixed annual interest rate of about 1%. The total allotted amount to the euro area banks was €1 trillion. In 2014, the ECB announced two more series of targeted long-term refinancing operations with a maturity of up to four years with practically zero interest rate, amounting to more than €700 billion, affecting directly borrowing conditions of enterprises in the euro area.  4. Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) As the crisis progressed and became more intensive at the beginning of 2012, spreads in the euro area government bond markets continued to widen, i.e. Spain’s 10-year government bond rose from 5% in March 2012 to 7.6% in July 2012. In the summer of 2012, President Draghi in his speech in London declared that the ECB, within its mandate, was prepared to do whatever it takes in order to preserve the euro, repeating the irreversibility of the euro currency, the three famous words “whatever it takes” that made him the second most influential Roman ever, after Julius Caesar with his three famous words “veni, vidi, vici”! Following that speech, the ECB developed a more structured policy of the sovereign bonds market announcing the Outright Monetary Transactions programme (OMT). How much money the ECB spent for this OMT programme so far? Zero euro!!! It is the powerful impact of credible policy announcements.  5. Quantitative Easing (QE) Due to the headwinds coming primarily from the international economy, the inflation outlook in the euro area continued to deteriorate in the summer and autumn of 2014 something that threatened to destabilise long-term inflation expectations, putting the forbidden letter “D”, “D” for deflation, in the mouths of international investors.  As a result, in January 2015 the Governing Council announced the expanded asset purchase programme (APP), which included a large-scale purchase programme targeting government securities (PSPP) of €60 billion each month until September 2016. Currently, the Eurosystem holdings under the expanded asset purchase programme amount to around €2.4 trillion or 20% of euro area GDP (PSPP is worth almost €2 trillion, the remaining amount concerns covered bonds and asset-backed securities).   The positive effects of QE are mostly reflected in sovereign bond yields, the growth rate of loans and bank lending rates, and of course avoiding deflation in the euro area (see Mourmouras, Speeches on Monetary Policy and Global Capital Markets, 2017, Chapter 4).  6. Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) Also, Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) has been provided by national central banks in order to help domestic banks with liquidity shortages and 
16  prevent a domino effect. Hence, between 2010 and 2014, ELA had been extended to banks in Ireland, Greece, Cyprus, and Portugal, with the Eurosystem borrowing to these countries through ELA, surpassing €200 billion. In Greece, ELA has been provided by the Bank of Greece over the last eight years and reached its peak of €120 billion in March 2012. 7. The Eurosystem Resolution Liquidity (ERL) tool Last but not least, the ECB is considering now a new policy tool, the Eurosystem Resolution Liquidity (ERL) tool that would allow it to inject cash into banks under resolution, in other words, when are being rescued from the threat of insolvency. The ERL should be seen as a monetary policy tool, ensuring the banking system can transmit official interest rates to the real economy.  C.2 The role of the ECB on financial stability  On June 2012, the European Council reached an agreement about the creation of the European framework for banks’ supervision through the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), which forms the first pillar of the Banking Union. The ECB has been assigned specific tasks to be carried out through the SSM like for instance, to ensure the safety and soundness of the European banking system, increase financial integration and stability and ensure consistent supervision. Currently, the ECB is directly supervising 118 “systemically significant banks”, representing almost 82% of total banking assets in the euro area and indirectly supervises less significant banks in the participating countries, which number approximately 3,500 in the euro area! It’s the same SSM, chaired by Danièle Nouy, which conducted the latest stress tests in Greek banks, the results of which came out last month. Two weeks ago, during her recent visit at the Bank of Greece, Chair Nouy emphasised to us that Greek banks need to do more to reduce their very high stock of non-performing loans (NPLs), highlighting that this is the biggest challenge facing the banking sector in the country exiting its third bailout programme in August.  D. Concluding remarks  Instead of an epilogue, I would like to close my speech with a question from the future, “back to the future”: So with all the above crisis-management tools available, is the euro area today in a better position vis-à-vis 2008 to tackle the next crisis, which, by the way, may be just around the corner? I already talked about Italy in my introduction.  With monetary policy reaching its limits, namely, negative rates (in 2008, the base rate was +4%, today it is negative) and the trillions bought by the ECB through its QE programme, and the scarcity issue which naturally arises, clearly, monetary policy can’t be the “only game in town” during the next crisis. In that eventuality, there will be hopefully a more active role for fiscal policy with more fiscal backstops 
17  to be implemented, moving also towards more risk-sharing in the euro area. Many people, including myself, feel that we need to strike a balance in the classic struggle between solidarity and national responsibility, or the ‘new wine in the same old bottle’, namely risk-sharing (namely mutualisation of costs) versus risk reduction. Especially in the South of Europe, there is a strong feeling that this balance is unstable and in order to make it more stable and more symmetrical, what is needed are stronger European institutions, for instance, a full-blown Banking Union and the ESM being turned into a proper European Monetary Fund. It is important to bring forward the date of the establishment of the European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS), the Banking Union’s third pillar, which is scheduled for 2025, providing stronger and more uniform deposit insurance cover. Even the announcement of the entry into full operation of EDIS will have a strong confidence-building effect on depositors, in the sense of avoiding risks of self-fulfilling prophecies on bank runs.   The Jean Monnet principle is inter-temporal and applies at all times: “Europe is the sum of the solutions adopted to address the crises it is faced with.” The European clock is ticking down and the EU must take action at the June Council in two weeks’ time or at the latest at the December Summit, otherwise the European electorate will punish its politicians for their slow reflexes at the European elections in a year’s time, leading to a generalised crisis of confidence in the European Union. Over its long history, Europe has traditionally managed to find consensus on the burning issues facing it, even at the very last minute. As a true European myself, I only hope that this time will not be different!  Thank you very much for your attention. 
Maja Kadievska-Vojnovik: Fintech and digital transformation -"Regulating an anonymous world"Platform for discussion by Ms Maja Kadievska-Vojnovik, Vice-Governor of the National Bank ofthe Republic of Macedonia, at the xCEEd Conference on Fintex, Belgrade, 22-23 May 2018.*   *   *FinTech Sector – General trends, current state in Macedonia, main challenges and risksand impact on central banks’ activityFinTech is one of the fastest-growing sectors in the global financial services industry nowadayswith total global venture investment in FinTech companies reaching high of $13.6 billion in2016(KPMG, 2016).The highest number of FinTech service providers is in the payments,clearing and settlement category, followed by credit, deposit and capital-raising services (BaselCommittee on the Banking Supervision Survey, 2016).Research in the area (ATKearney & EFMA, 2013) points to several factors that define readinessfor digitization in the banking sector such as: 1) the capacity of banks for innovation; 2) the stageof technological development where the country is located; 3) the level of competition in thesector; 4) culture of consumption; 5) demographic structure of the population;  6) degree ofconcentration in the banking sector; and 7) the existing regulation, which can promote orconstrain emergence of new technological solutions.On the other hand, there are some constraining factors that hamper digitalization in South EastEurope, including Macedonia, such as: the negative effects that the financial crisis had on theability of banks to innovate, and the local mentality of the population which still does not show asufficient level of confidence in online activities.Financial services industry in Macedonia is in essence still traditional, conservative industry, butis evolving. Banks strive to keep pace and fit in the new digital era by investing more and morefunds in new products and financial innovations, as well as sponsoring software developmentconferences and new technologies.This is supported by relatively solid infrastructure for digitization in Macedonia which is readilyavailable at satisfactory level. For example, 76% of households in Macedonia had access tointernet in 2017 vis-à-vis 85% in the EU. On average, bank deponents have two paymentaccounts in Macedonia. However, only 7% of payment accounts held by the households can beused for electronic payments, while this share is relatively higher in case of legal entities (29%).The latter initiated 51% of the credit transfer in an electronic way, while the households initiatedelectronically only 20% of their credit transfers in 2017. The companies usually initiate theirpayments by using computers, while households rely mainly on computers (92% of electroniccredit transfers), mobile phones (7% of electronic credit transfers) and ATM (1% of electroniccredit transfers). In comparative context with the EU members, we are lagging behind given that91% of credit transfers were electronically initiated in the old EU members and 86% in the newEU member countries in 2016. Regarding digital channels used for ordering goods and services,internet shoppers in Macedonia increased by 5 p.p. during the last five years and reached 15% ofthe population that used internet in 2017. This is quite below the 57% of internet shoppers in theEU in 2017, according to the Eurostat. Internet shopping is becoming popular among all agegroups, but the young internet users have the highest share of online shoppers among internetusers.In addition, the development of FinTech companies is expected in the coming period throughfurther liberalization of payment transactions and the further trend of opening of the informationsystems of the banks towards this type of companies. 1 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
The absence of liberalization in payments industry can be treated as a factor that in a senseconstrained digitalization in Macedonia in the past. This is expected to change with the new Lawon payment services and systems which isunder procedure implementing PSD2, PAD, E-money2, Settlement Finality Directive, IFR provisions and some provisions of Regulation on credittransfers and direct debit. The new law is expected to provide more stimulating environment forfinancial innovations allowing for new entrants to the market with innovative payments solutions,while establishing standards that will enhance the security and consumer protection.Financial regulation – How to promote safe and secure financial innovationsA sound legal framework is important for private service providers to develop secure and efficientpayment services and for authorities to keep the confidence of users in the regular functioning ofthe payment system.The development of payment services is a continuously evolving dynamic process, driven bytechnological advances. Market players design new services that better adapt to users’ needs inorder to expand their business. In doing so, they try to balance the new opportunities the marketopens up with the financial regulation they have to comply with. However, private players want tomaximize their profits and may not have the right incentives to reach a socially viable equilibrium.In this sense the regulator monitors the development of the market and technological advancesto be able:to foster innovation (and better customer experience);strike the right balance between security and efficiency;adapt the regulation to new services;put in place effective consumer protection measures;ensure fair competition among market players;avoid regulatory arbitrage.The new regulatory framework in Macedonia which is in an advanced stage of drafting, aims atbalancing safety and creativity. In order to protect consumers and maintain financial stability, thenew framework envisages licensing regime for the non-banking payment service providers aswell as an appropriate safeguarding measures for client’s funds. However, it supports the growof start-ups in the Fintech sector by easing some of the regulatory requirements related to theinitial capital, BCP, external audit etc. Moreover, it intends to allow already establishedcompanies or start-ups that aim to provide payment services to be involved in other businessactivities allowing them to diversify the business risk and freedom to grow. Open Banking – Benefits, challenges and risksDigital disruption is the driver that enables banks to keep pace with customer demands. Byadopting the right digital business model, banks can take advantage of open banking to unleashnew business value. Being an open bank means operating like a platform company, with abusiness model that connects people and processes with assets and a technology infrastructureto manage internal and external users’ interactions. Open banking—a platform-based businessapproach— is a new way of how banks generate value, born out of the increasing pressuresfrom regulations and competitors. Outside the banking domain, industry leaders like Google,Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Alibaba are unleashing technology’s power by developingplatform-based business models and taking advantage of the strategies they enable. Since thebeginning of 2018, sharing proprietary data with third parties is not an option for European banks,with PSD2 in the European Union. Investments are being made to make this a reality; almost $1billion was invested in PSD2 enabled services in 2016 (up to 200 percent from 2015).1 2 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
In the core of Open banking are the application programming interfaces (APIs), which has alsobeen used and facilitated by eBay starting in early 2000s, and also by technological giants likeGoogle, Apple, Uber, and so on. Thus, banks could have similar benefits by adopting the APIs orthe Open Banking concept. The emerging ecosystem of Bank & FinTech partnerships andcollaborations i.e. Open Bank has paved the way for the data sharing economy, and a way banksto monetize their digital assets and data. Many open initiatives and government regulations openup access to the customer data banks hold on other businesses. Regulations such as Access-to-Accounts as part of PSD II and Open API (application programming interface) standards arepaving the way for an open API ecosystem. Regulators in many other countries are alsoevaluating feasibility of open APIs with the aim to provide consumers with secure, lessexpensive, and easy-to-use financial services.PSD2, as the most significant regulation, will arguably make the greatest impact in opening upbank-held customer account data to Account Information Service Providers. The ecosystem ofopen banking would be influenced by PSD2. Firstly, PSD2 does not mandate the creation ofcommon API standards. This means that individual banks may make their data available throughdifferent technical standards. Secondly, PSD2 only opens up access to customer transactionaldata for specific institutions, which must also be regulated PSPs. Furthermore, the concept ofplatform is a crucial factor for open banking, whereas regarding financial industry, thephenomenon of platforms has to be further developed. For payments and personal informationthis is expected to gain traction through the PSD2, as third parties can engage in serviceprovisioning without actually owning bank assets. Open Banking extends this concept further.From the customer’s point of view it means increased choice and control over financial assets,data and the service providers having access to this.The big aim of Open Banking is to increase competition in the market by driving innovation in thequality of products and services that customers receive. The current account market hascomplex pricing, low customer switching, difficulties in comparing products and high charges onoverdrafts. The outcome is that people are paying more for lower quality services than they needto. In 2016, Accenture conducted a research with consumers which showed that 85% of 18–24year olds would trust third parties to aggregate their financial data. In contrast, 48% of 55–64 yearolds were neutral or positive. These figures already suggest that we will witness a battle for thecustomer relationship and data between banks and FinTech. The outcome of this battle will becrucial in determining the future of the bank models which will likely face several transitionstages. At the current stage, the existing banks are under pressure by the FinTech to improvecost efficiency and the customer relationship. Given their market knowledge and good marketpositions, the existing banks may adapt relatively fast by adopting new technologies in closecooperation with the FinTech. In the future, banks and FinTech companies may strengthen theircooperation as joint ventures, partners or other type of structures where delivery of services tothe clients is shared between them. However, it is not excluded that some of the existing bankswill not survive the wave of technology-enabled disruption and are replaced by new technology-driven banks founded by FinTech and BigTech companies. In a more extreme scenario, which isnot likely nowadays but may be viable in the very long run, banks are displaced by FinTech andBigTech companies and are no longer significant players on the market. In order to establishOpen Banking in Macedonia, it is necessary to implement the best practices and regulationsfrom European countries. Although our regulation is still in drafting process, our Banks are notpassive in this field and are already undertaking activities for opening their IT systems with newinterfaces and modules for interacting with customers and external companies.The biggest challenge that can endanger this process are digital space attacks (cyberattacks) inthis domain, which are a relevant threat with a high probability of happening.The National Bank as a regulator is in charge of defining the framework for information security inour financial system. The task of our banks is to implement concrete safeguards on thetechnical, administrative and physical level based on performed analysis of risks from2 3 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
introduction and use of new services, which includes the risks of digital attacks.In 2016, the National Bank conducted thematic control through the development of a tool wherebybanks made their own assessments of the inherent risk and appropriately determined theactivities that they needed to fulfill on different levels of readiness from attacks from the digitalspace (primary, secondary and advanced level of readiness).Blockchain technology and impact on central banks’ activityThe potential of blockchain is immense and is an issue for the central banks as well. At retaillevel blockchain from Central bank perspective in regards to cryptocurrencies or Central bankcryptocurrencies (CBCCs) does not exist. However, the concept of a retail CBCC has beenwidely discussed by bloggers, central bankers and academics.While CBCCs for retail payments remain at the conceptual stage, some central banks havecompleted proofs of concept for DLT-based applications. One of the reasons for the interest inDLT is that many central bank-operated wholesale payment systems are at the end of theirtechnological life cycles. The systems are programmed in obsolete languages or use databasedesigns that are no longer fit for purpose and are costly to maintain.Project Jasper at the Bank of Canada (Chapman et al (2017)) and Project Ubin at the MonetaryAuthority of Singapore (MAS (2017)) and STELLA – a joint research project of the EuropeanCentral Bank and the Bank of Japan simulate real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS) on aDLT platform.The two projects Jasper and Ubin show that central bank money can be transferred on adistributed ledger in real time, in realistic volumes. Nevertheless, none of the current initiatives toupdate or replace existing wholesale payment systems are considering the adoption of DLT.The ECB and the BOJ, in their role as operators of important market infrastructures services,decided to conduct in-depth experiments to determine whether specific existing functionalities oftheir respective payment systems could run in a DLT environment. Findings in relation toefficiency show that, with regard to the specific aspects of RTGS services tested to date, a DLT-based solution could meet the performance needs of current large value payment systems.In conclusion, this joint effort of ECB and the BOJ has produced a thorough set of results thatprovide reasons to be optimistic with respect to the capabilities of DLT within payment systems.It is, however, important to bear in mind that this work has been conducted in a test environment;therefore, any assumptions regarding the capacity for DLT to be used in production should notbe made from this report.Both, the Bank of England (2017) and Bank of Canada (Ho, 2017)) conclude that DLT is not yetmature enough for current adoption. Yet most central banks that are considering modernizingtheir core payment infrastructure stress the need to make new systems inter-operable withfuture DLT platforms.Looking beyond the immediate horizon, many industry participants see significant potential forDLT to increase efficiency and reduce reconciliation costs in securities clearing and settlement.One potential benefit of DLT-based structures is immediate clearing and settlement of securities,in contrast to the multiple-day lags that currently exist when exchanging cash for securities (andvice versa). Progress in this direction was recently achieved by a joint venture between theDeutsche Bundesbank and Deutsche Börse, which developed a functional prototype of a DLTbased securities settlement platform that achieves delivery-versus-payment settlement of digitalcoins and securities (Deutsche Bundesbank (2016)).Whether or not a central bank should provide a digital alternative to cash is most pressing in 4 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
countries, such as Sweden, where cash usage is rapidly declining. But all central banks mayeventually have to decide whether issuing CBCCs makes sense in their own context.In making this decision, central banks will have to consider not only consumer preferences forprivacy and possible efficiency gains – in terms of payments, clearing and settlement – but alsothe risks it may entail for the financial system and the wider economy, as well as any implicationsfor monetary policy. Some of the risks are currently hard to assess. For instance, at present verylittle can be said about the cyber-resilience of CBCCs, something not touched upon in this shortfeature.In this context, the current regulatory framework predate the emergence of FinTech companies.Therefore, it will certainly be changed and as a matter of fact it is already an evolving process inmany countries, including Macedonia. This means that in the light of new FinTech risks, thecurrent supervisory frameworks will evolve in a manner that ensures appropriate oversight ofbanking and non-banking service provider’s activity as well as new payment systems based onDLT solutions while avoiding innovation hindering. Different countries may follow differentsupervisory regimes, which includes direct oversight of the new market players, thenestablishing innovation hubs, accelerators and regulatory sandboxes.The role of Regtech in enhancing regulatory and compliance challengesDigital finance raises new risks and new areas of vulnerability might develop because of newfinancial products (virtual cryptocurrencies) and new technologies (distributed ledger based onanonymous users and on decentralized governance without accountability). Digital finance givesrise to an increasing number of financial players and eases cross-border transactions, whichmakes the monitoring of transactions more complex for financial institutions and publicauthorities. Finally, while new financial players are reshaping the financial sector, they may beoutside the scope of banking sector regulation and subject to less stringent AML/CFT rules thanare banks.New technologies may support greater efficiency for staying compliant. Regtech companies areespecially keen to provide banks with more effective ways to improve their compliance and riskmanagement, through outsourcing or insourcing processes. They may open up opportunities fordigital transformation of control and support functions within banks (risk, compliance, legal,finance, IT). Regtech could address a wide array of requirements related to regulatory reporting,financial crime, operational risk (including cyber-security and fraud detection), consumerprotection and data protection regulation. Although there are many Regtech companies operatingin developed countries, there are no examples of Regtech operating in Macedonia. Nevertheless,Macedonian banks and non-bank players are allowed to use services offered by Regtechcompanies operating globally in order to stay compliant with the rising regulatory requirements.“Open for Business – CHOOSING DIGITAL BUSINESS MODELS FOR BANKS TO DRIVE NEW GROWTH” –Accenture strategyAccenture Payments, Consumers’ initial reactions to the new services enabled by PSD2, 201612 5 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
SUERF/BAFFI CAREFIN Centre Conference‘Do we need central bank digital currencies?  Economics, technology and psychology’21st century cash: Central banking,  technological innovation and digital currenciesKeynote address by the Deputy Governor of the Bank of ItalyFabio PanettaBocconi UniversityMilan, 7 June 2018

   1. Introduction1 It is a great pleasure to be here. The topic of this conference speaks to the heart of some of the most challenging questions for central banks today: how is the digital revolution affecting the financial system? What is the impact on consumers, the economy and on central banks themselves? These are complex questions, related to the consequences of the fourth industrial revolution in our society,2 within which central bank digital currencies (CBDC in short) might one day play an important part.  I will not attempt to provide comprehensive answers to all of these questions. Rather, I will focus on some general issues related to the digital transformation of our society, the pros and cons of digital cash (as a means of payment and store of value) and, before concluding, recall some of the open issues regarding CBDCs. 2. The digital transformation of society Technological progress is fostering the digital representation of many of our daily activities. For example, the use of physical letters and postcards has been dwarfed by emails and digital photos, with the estimated number of letter-like items sent worldwide in one year roughly equal to the number of emails sent in a single day.3 Instant messaging apps such as QQ and WhatsApp allow their estimated three billion users to have digital conversations across the globe.4 The process of digitization reflects increasing demand for immediacy by individuals, and is transforming our behaviour, our culture and the structure of the economy.  1  I wish to thank Nicola Branzoli and Marcello Miccoli for their valuable help during the preparation of this speech.  2  See Schwab K. The Fourth Industrial Revolution, New York: Crown Publishing Group, (2017) and Gordon R. (2012), ‘Is U.S. Economic Growth Over? Faltering Innovation Confronts the Six Headwinds’, NBER, Working Paper 18315, August 2012.  3  Source: based on data from Universal Postal Union and Radicati Group.  4  Source: Radicati Group.                                                             
Digitization has also been prominent in the financial system. For example, the dematerialization of financial assets has been instrumental in the emergence of electronic trading platforms. Online banking, the digital representation of brick-and-mortar bank branches, has gained in popularity since its introduction in the 1990s . The advent of digitization is particularly evident in the payment system. Until not long ago retail payments could only be made with cash or cheques. But these days who uses cheques anymore? Digital innovation in payments has gone even further, with payment tools available directly through an app on a smartphone or even by simply using a smartwatch. The issuance of CBDCs – a digital version of cash – could accordingly be seen as a natural consequence of the broader process of digitization of the financial system. In a world where securities and contracts are dematerialized and traded electronically, where payments are made with smartphones and investment advice is provided by computers, why should cash be only physical? Is the central bank missing out on the benefits of innovation by not issuing a CBDC? Crypto-assets (or virtual currencies as they were called before it was realized that they cannot perform the functions of money) are sometimes associated with digital currency. Let me emphasize, though it is redundant for this audience, that CBDCs have nothing to do with crypto-assets such as Bitcoin. In fact – just like banknotes – a CBDC would be a liability of the central bank and would be backed by its assets. It would be supported by the credibility of the central bank and, ultimately, by the rule of law. Crypto-assets, on the other hand, are a liability belonging to nobody: there is no asset that backs them up and no clear governance structure that can guarantee trust. For these reasons, the value of a CBDC would not suffer from the excessive volatility that affects crypto-assets. 3. The pros and cons of digital cash But let’s go back to the main question of today’s conference: should central banks issue a digital currency? One way to address this issue is from the perspective of an agent (the central bank) in charge of supplying cash on behalf of the State, with the ultimate goal of maximizing social welfare. In this respect it is important to distinguish between the possible role of the digital currency as a means of payment and as a store of value.5  5  These are two of the three functions of money. The third one, money as a unit of account, is not relevant here, since a digital currency issued by the central banks would be denominated in the same unit as existing banknotes.                                                             4
CBDCs as a means of payment As a means of payment, a CBDC would add to the available digital payment services, thus increasing the degree of competition in this sector. But the set of tools that permit almost frictionless and instantaneous payments is already large: today we can make a digital payment by wire transfer (through online banking), with credit or debit cards, using Paypal or Apple pay (to name just a few); we can do it via computers, smartphones or smartwatches, by simply putting our wrist close to a point of sale. Competition in the supply of payment services is already high, and the efficiency of the system will increase with the introduction in many jurisdictions of instant payments – yet another alternative to cash.6 From this vantage point the advantages of a CBDC are at best unclear: its potential benefits in terms of improving the ease of transactions are probably insufficient to justify the involvement of central banks in an activity that is well served by private suppliers.  A CBDC could nonetheless improve access to digital payments for specific groups of consumers. In fact, some consumers do not have a bank account – a precondition for using existing digital payment tools. A CBDC could offer them access to these tools at minimum or zero cost. In the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Spain, to name a few high-income countries where one might easily think that financial inclusion is almost universal, the share of the population without a bank account is between 4 and 7 per cent.7  In Italy the proportion of unbanked households is similar (7 per cent, or 1.8 million households).8 Survey evidence suggests that account maintenance costs and physical distance from a bank are among the reasons for not having a bank account. However, a closer look at the socio-demographic characteristics of unbanked consumers shows that they have low income but also low education: 90 per cent of the unbanked households are in the bottom half of the income 6  Instant payments (IPs) allow consumers to transfer funds in almost real time. The Eurosystem entered into IPs with the TIPS project, which will offer settlement facilities in central bank money to IPs schemes starting from November 2018. The extent to which IPs will succeed as substitutes for cash is an open question. The experience of the countries where IPs were first introduced is mixed. For example in the UK, where IPs were introduced ten years ago, the average value of IPs is £800, more than an ordinary cash payment and similar to a traditional credit transfer. 7  Demirgüç, A., Klapper, L., Singer, D., Ansar, S., and Hess, J.

distribution and have little or no formal education. To the extent that consumers have no access to bank accounts – and thus to digital payment tools – for reasons other than cost, the introduction of a CBDC would not improve the situation. Again, at this stage the available evidence is at best insufficient to justify introducing a CBDC, in spite of the importance of the goal of improving financial inclusion.9  The introduction of a digital means of payment could be justified by the objective of reducing the cost of cash i.e. outlays for its production, transportation, disposal, etc. Recent estimates suggest that these costs amount to about half of a percentage point of GDP in the European Union every year,10 or to around €76 billion. By way of comparison, this figure amounts to almost half of the annual EU budget. These estimates are a lower bound of the actual costs, since they do not include households’ costs, such as the time it takes to obtain banknotes (shoe-leather costs), which are difficult to estimate. However, they are shrouded in uncertainty; moreover, central banks, commercial banks and all those who handle cash are constantly striving to improve efficiency.  Would the cost of providing a CBDC be lower than that of cash? The costs of managing cash are due to its physical nature and in a digital world they would disappear. Non-monetary costs, such as households’ shoe-leather costs of finding a cash provider, would also disappear if cash were accessible via the smartphone in our pocket. Hardware and software costs would, instead, increase. However, digital technology already plays a crucial role in the financial sector. It is used to transfer commercial bank money, to buy and sell securities, and to process information. It is continuously tested and updated and protected against risks, first and foremost cyber risk. The technology needed to transfer digital cash would likely have strong complementarities with the existing digital networks and infrastructure. This suggests that the overall costs of providing a means of payment may well decrease with the introduction of a CBDC. The potential efficiency gains promised by new technological solutions such as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), though still unclear, could also help lower the cost of managing CBDCs.  9  Here I ignore the fact that it is disputable, likely suboptimal and undesirable to assign the goal of improving financial inclusion to central banks.  10  Schmiedel, H., Kostova, G., and Ruttenberg, W. ‘The social and private costs of retail payment instruments:  a European perspective’, European Central Bank Occasional Paper 137, 2017.                                                             6
CBDCs as a store of value Another important function of money is as a store of value. The cost of storing cash, a key factor in its use as a store of value, has been estimated at between 0.5 and 1 per cent of the value stored.11 Since it would be completely dematerialized, a CBDC would have very few or no storage costs and would be a convenient way for households and firms to keep liquid wealth. Mattresses could be freed from their role of vaults! In addition to being superior to cash as a store of value, a CBDC would be an asset with unique characteristics, free of credit and liquidity risk. It might be preferred to other instruments commonly used to store wealth, such as bank deposits. The consequences of this have caused concerns: a switch from bank deposits to a CBDC could lead to a funding shortfall in the banking system, with potential adverse effects on the supply and cost of lending to the real economy. In extreme conditions the availability of a CBDC could even increase the risk of a digital bank run. The potential consequences of having a large portion of wealth structurally transferred from bank deposits into a CBDC could be significant for our financial system. Currently in the euro area overnight deposits of non-financial private entities amount to around €6.5 trillion,  20 per cent of the balance sheet of the banking system. I am not convinced, however, that the effects would necessarily be disruptive for banks. First, only some categories of deposits might migrate to the central bank (most likely sight deposits, that pay little or no interest). Second, banks can compete by offering services that CBDCs cannot, such as access to credit and payment services. Third, banks could increase their recourse to wholesale funding.  But banks’ business model would be affected. The decrease in callable liabilities could ultimately push towards a ‘narrow’ banking system,12 that is an operational framework in which banks have little or no maturity mismatch between assets and liabilities. The debate about the benefits of narrow banking goes back centuries,13 with no easy answer; economists will likely have to examine the issue anew.  11  See, for instance, Witmer, J. and Yang, J. “Estimating Canada’s Effective Lower Bound”, Bank of Canada Review, Spring 2016 or “Banks look for cheap way to store cash piles as rates go negative”, Financial Times, August 16, 2016. 12  See Broadbent, B. “Central banks and digital currencies”, speech at the London School of Economics, March 2016. 13  See Pennacchi, G. (2012), ‘Narrow Banking’, Annual Review of Financial Economics, vol. 4, issue 1, pp. 141-159.                                                             7
The magnitude of these effects will depend on the demand for CBDCs by the public, which in turn will vary according to the currency’s specific, yet still uncertain, characteristics – such as whether it would be remunerated or whether it would be account based or token based.  Balancing the risks and benefits The risks and benefits of CBDCs are two sides of the same (digital) coin, related to the role of money as a means of payment and a store of value. Recourse to a CBDC as a means of payment may well have benefits, but their precise nature is uncertain and they may still be too small to justify the introduction of a digital currency. Moreover, the issuance of a CBDC may become less positive on balance if we take into account the potential effects on the demand for commercial bank deposits. The risks and benefits would be affected by the characteristics of the CBDC, but in any event the risks would not disappear altogether.  The business case for introducing CBDCs remains at best unclear. However, like all issues related to technological innovation, the costs, benefits and risks of digital currencies are likely to change rapidly in the future. This suggests that central banks should continue to examine the potential effects of digital currencies. Indeed, many of them are currently engaged in research and technical experimentation with a CBDC. The Riksbank, Bank of England, and Bank of Canada, to name a few, are actively analyzing the issue. Some have gone even further, such as the Central Bank of Uruguay, which has launched a pilot project.14 At Banca d’Italia, we are also studying how a CBDC would impact our financial system and monetary policy, and we are working within the Eurosystem on trials using DLT, which might prove useful for a digital currency. Researchers are also actively reflecting on CBDCs. Today’s conference is a notable example.  4. Some open issues As mentioned above, the risks and benefits of CBDCs, together with their impact on the financial system, the real economy and on society, closely depend on their characteristics.15  14  The Danmarks Nationalbank is sceptical about whether the benefits of a CBDC can really prevail over its costs. See Gürtler, S., and Rasmussen, S. Central bank digital currency in Denmark?, December 2017. 15  See Bank for International Settlements, ”Central bank digital currencies”, March 2018.                                                             8
Probably the most important issue is whether the digital currency should be traceable or whether it should be designed to guarantee, to the extent possible, anonymity. Cash has always been an incredible instrument: it allows for third-party anonymity in transactions and leaves no trace. While this implies that it is an effective means of payment for illicit activities such as money laundering, the financing of terrorism or tax evasion, it also ensures privacy for its users.  The possibility of tracing our digital transactions may have important economic and ethical implications. Imagine for a moment that payments data suggested that spending on alcohol and the probability of defaulting on a loan are positively correlated. Based on such evidence, a bank might decide to reject a loan demand by an applicant with high expenditure on alcohol, even though the correlation does not reflect any ex-ante causal relationship between these two variables but could be simply due, for example, to an ex-post common psychological factor.16 Though it may be over simplified, this example emphasizes that we need to address carefully the privacy issues that may stem from digitization, and in particular from the introduction of a CBDC. Today these risks are still limited, as in most countries retail transactions are concluded mainly with cash, and the record of our electronic payments represents an imprecise screening device.17 This is changing rapidly, however. Just who should decide on the degree of anonymity associated with the use of a CBDC? Clearly, this is more than just a technical issue, and as such, the choice does not belong to central banks alone but also to the political sphere. We need to think carefully, right now, about how to make the introduction of a CBDC fully compatible with the rights of individuals and about how to square the increasing availability of information on the private lives of each one of us in relation to our political views, state of health, or sexual orientation, with the protection of our personal freedom and with the rules that govern the functioning of a modern liberal democracy.  Another key issue is whether a CBDC should be remunerated or, as in the case of cash, should pay no interest. This choice would have far-reaching consequences for the core activities of the central 16  The introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation might limit the application of profiling but does not make it illegal (see https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/reform/rights-citizens/my-rights/can-i-be-subject-automated-individual-decision-making-including-profiling_en). 17  For example, in the EU cash payments represent 65 per cent of total retail transactions. See Schmiedel, H., Kostova, G. and Ruttenberg, W. “The social and private costs of retail payment instruments: a European perspective”, European Central Bank Occasional Paper, no. 137, 2017.                                                              9
bank, from financial stability to monetary policy, but they would also affect other issues, such as the volume and allocation of seigniorage. For example, interest payments would make a CBDC a closer substitute of bank deposits.18 This would increase the volatility of deposits and, in extreme conditions, could even facilitate a digital bank run (whose probability is increased by the very existence of a CBDC): in bad times, depositors could switch rapidly and at no cost from their bank account to the CBDC. The central bank could limit such risks – for example by setting a ceiling on the amount of CBDC that each individual investor can hold, or by bringing the remuneration to zero for holdings of CBDCs above a certain threshold – but this would raise a number of technical issues.19 At the same time, an interest-earning CBDC would reinforce the transmission of monetary impulses to banks, households and businesses.20 In downturns, by lowering the remuneration of the digital currency the central bank could spur banks to reduce deposit rates; it could push them below zero (assuming that cash would no longer be available), improving its capacity to stimulate the economy in extreme conditions without necessarily resorting to unconventional measures.21 A symmetrical mechanism would be at work in upturns, when an increase in the remuneration of the CBDC (which would represent the floor of market rates) would force banks to take swift action to also increase the remuneration of their deposits.  A shift from interest-free cash to an interest-bearing CBDC would affect seigniorage in multiple ways: in addition to the direct effect on interest payments by the central bank (which would have a negative impact on seigniorage), it would have indirect effects by reducing the costs of supplying cash (positive impact) and by increasing the demand for central bank liabilities (positive impact). The overall effect is ambiguous, but it could be non-negligible and have non-trivial distributional consequences: central bank profits, transferred to the State and used as the State sees fit, could change 18  On the contrary, a CBDC without interest would be comparable to cash.  19 For example, a ceiling on individual holdings of CBDC could limit the number or size of payments, as the recipients’ holdings of CBDC would have to be known in order to finalize the payment. See Gürtler, S., and Rasmussen, S. Central bank digital currency in Denmark?, December 2017. 20  See Bank for International Settlements, ”Central bank digital currencies”, March 2018, and Coeuré, B.”The future of central bank money”, speech at the International Center for Monetary and Banking Studies, Geneva, May 2018. 21  If central banks pushed interest rates into negative territory in a world with a non-remunerated CBDC, banks would effectively avoid the negative rates by substituting reserves with digital currency. Banks could adopt this same strategy in a world with physical cash, but the high cost of storing it makes this option less attractive, inducing banks to accept moderately negative interest rates.                                                              10
significantly once currency holders are remunerated. The political economy consequences of this should not be underestimated. Turning now to the specifics of CBDC implementation, central banks should decide whether CBDCs should be token-based – whereby each token represents a particular denomination of the currency, like banknotes – or, like bank deposits, account-based, whereby holdings are accounting records. Again, this choice would have important consequences for a number of key issues such as anonymity (a token-based CBDC would imply a better protection of privacy)22 or the organization of the central bank. In particular, managing an account-based system with millions of account balances, each potentially changing every day, would require an incredible effort by the central bank. The implementation of a token-based system, instead, would be easier and could be delegated to a private party. In both cases the security and resilience of the CBDC to cyber-attacks must be assured, in order to preserve trust in the currency. Digital hacking of the currency can reap very large rewards, in all likelihood larger than counterfeiting banknotes – the recent attack on the central bank of Bangladesh comes to mind.23 Undoubtedly hackers everywhere are dreaming about how to violate the digital currency system! The number of questions related to CBDCs is enormous and the public debate about them is only in its infancy. I cannot address all the issues today. But I do wish to emphasize one last point before concluding my remarks. If central banks decided to make an asset – the CBDC – free of credit and liquidity risk, possibly remunerated, and available to anybody at no cost, their role in the economy would fundamentally change. The size of their balance sheets would likely increase, and with it their footprint in the economy. If the CBDC were account-based, central banks would start to interact directly with the private non-financial sector. Are central banks ready to play this new role and to deal with the attendant complexities? In the short term my answer is no. Beyond the short term, greater investment in new technologies and human capital would be necessary to address the challenges associated with issuing a CBDC.  22  See for example Mersch, Y. “Digital Base Money: an assessment from the ECB’s perspective”, speech at Suomen Pankki, January 2017.  23  For instance, a malware installed on the Bangladesh central bank’s computer successfully diverted around $80 million from its accounts.                                                              11
5. Conclusions The technological revolution is pushing us towards a digital representation of many objects in our daily lives. Banknotes might be next in line. However, there are still many uncertainties on that front. Some of them are economic in nature, such as the efficiency of the payment system and financial stability. Others are related to individual rights, such as the right to privacy.  Society as a whole would do well to decide on how to tackle the latter before the central bank steps in. Other issues, which I have not had time to touch on today, but are no less important, are of a legal nature. Can a central bank issue a new form of currency without explicit authorization by the government? If the CBDC is legal tender, does this mean that everybody will need to have the technical means to accept it? In many countries new laws may be required before any concrete steps towards a CBDC are taken. For a central bank, issuing a digital currency is like travelling in a new land: the path to take will be chosen at the same time as the map is drawn. The many uncertainties involved will undoubtedly make the journey exciting and full of discoveries, though a substantial amount of prudence and wisdom will still be required. All in all, this is hardly going to be a purely technical decision. Society as a whole, through its political bodies, will need to be involved. Whether central banks should issue digital currencies – and with what characteristics – remains an open question and I look forward to hearing the views that will be presented today. I remain convinced that physical cash will continue for quite some time to be part of the payment system. It is hard to dispute that money is probably one of the most important and useful social constructs, one that has been with us for around 3,000 years24 and is still very much in use. Cash is by far the dominant means of payment, both in the euro area25 and elsewhere,26 and demand for it has been on the rise in most advanced economies in the last decade. Currency in circulation in the euro area amounts to around €1.1 trillion, and has recorded steady growth rates in recent years. Coins and banknotes have proven to be a resilient technology, it may be too early to call for their complete retirement.  24  See, for instance, Robert A. Mundell, ‘The birth of coinage’, Columbia University, mimeo, 2002. 25  Esselink Henk and Lola Hernández (2017), ‘The use of cash by households in the euro area,’ ECB Occasional Paper series 201/2017. Available at http://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpops/ecb.op201.en.pdf. 26  Bech, Morten Linnemann, Umar Faruqui, Frederik Ougaard and Cristina Picillo (2018), ‘Payments are a-changin' but cash still rules’.

While the jury is still out on whether we will have a CBDC, the debate is already bringing benefits. Many central banks, including Banca d’Italia, are experimenting with new technologies such as DLT and Artificial Intelligence, studying how they work and how they can be put to productive use. This research contributes to the advancement of the technological frontier, and helps make the financial system more resilient to technological and cyber risks. These benefits are here to stay, independently of whether one day we will live in a world with digital cash.  13

Page 1 of 4    Opening remarks by Francois Groepe, Deputy Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, at the launch of the Project Khokha report  Sandton Convention Centre, Johannesburg 5 June 2018  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.  On behalf of the South African Reserve Bank (SARB), I would like to extend a sincere and warm welcome to everyone here today on the occasion of the launch of the report on Project Khokha, which had as its scope the trial of interbank wholesale settlement using distributed ledger technology (DLT). This was our first DLT initiative; its aim was to contribute to the global initiatives that assess the application and use case for DLT.   I am pleased to confirm that Project Khokha was successful in that it proved that the typical daily volume of the South African payments system could be processed in less than two hours with full confidentiality of transactions and settlement finality. This was done using ISO1 20022 standard messages within two seconds across a network of distributed nodes and with the requisite resilient distributed consensus.  The SARB is pleased that so many of you have taken the time out of your busy schedules to join us today. We appreciate that there is great interest in this work, both locally and from abroad.                                                  1 International Organization for Standardization 
Page 2 of 4  I will make brief introductory remarks and then hand over to the Governor of the SARB, Mr Lesetja Kganyago, to deliver the keynote address.  My remarks centre around three observations.   Barely six months ago, I could not have imagined that we would successfully trial the use of DLT to process high-value transactions. This was in part because I am acutely aware of the challenges involved in building wholesale payments capabilities and appreciate that, and proofs of concept can be both complex and take time to develop. As an example, the requirements for such an endeavour need to be carefully defined, prioritised, and mapped into functional and technical specifications. Furthermore, the coding, development and testing required is an intense and laborious exercise. Add to that the challenge of integration between multiple participants one comes to an appreciation why such initiatives are often multi-year projects.   The design, building and delivery of Project Khokha happened in less than three months. This is a noteworthy achievement. It is evident that the pace of innovation and technological development requires a shift to this new ‘agile design approach’ which demands fast turnaround. After all, the mantra of financial technology, or ‘fintech’, is ‘design flexibly, fail fast and succeed sooner’. This rapid prototyping and agile process to trial new ways of innovating in financial services is rapidly becoming the norm. As regulators, we are keenly aware that the days of playing catch-up with often long lags are no longer appropriate as such an approach may allow for systemic risk to build and for market conduct failures to go unchecked.   Project Khokha is therefore significant as it has demonstrated that regulatory institutions are indeed capable of responding to the rapidly changing environment with agility, flexibility and speed. The insights gained will also be beneficial in other areas of the SARB’s activity which extend beyond fintech initiatives.   
Page 3 of 4  My second observation is that the success of complex projects is built on strong collaboration – even in the trial or prototyping phase. This goes beyond the collaboration between participants; this also involves connecting with experts on ongoing unresolved challenges. For example, reaching settlement finality on DLT was a major issue not long ago. With the speed of change and a dedicated global effort, issues such as these are addressed over shorter timeframes as compared to the past.  I am proud to announce that Project Khokha has contributed to the global DLT body of knowledge as it is thought that this was the first time that the Istanbul Byzantine Fault Tolerance consensus mechanism and the Pedersen commitments for confidentiality had been used with Quorum. This helped to ensure that the tokenised rand remained a legitimate transaction during transfer, and it assisted with the honouring of participants’ privacy and confidentiality requirements.  It is evident that, in this new digital economy with potentially decentralised architecture, progress is made by gradually crossing new frontiers and by extending concepts and solutions. There is little doubt that DLT has huge potential, but that it equally has a substantial road ahead before large-scale adoption across multiple interconnected systems can be considered. Much more work is required, and collaboration is of vital importance as it deepens the collective knowledge base in an area where there is great variability in understanding due to the speed at which the technology is changing.   There is huge expectation among the broader financial services community around emerging exponential technologies such as blockchains and distributed ledgers. Multiple trials across many different industries across the globe are taking place. As South Africans, we should be active participants in leveraging innovation and technology to drive efficiencies within our financial system in order to reduce frictions. We furthermore should leverage the immense social and welfare benefits that these developments may deliver while ensuring that financial stability is not compromised.  
Page 4 of 4  Finally, while contributing to these efforts, we should be careful not to treat emerging technologies as a panacea for every problem. Whereas rapid prototyping brings the benefit of gaining practical insights and a deeper understanding, critically reflecting on what works and what doesn’t is an important aspect of the journey. Complex networked ecosystems encompass multiple dimensions: policy, legislation, economics, process, governance, business and, of course, legacy. The economists will remind us of the ‘stickiness’ and integrated nature of path-dependent systems. I would thus encourage all of us to continue to trial new approaches with vigour, but equally to be frank about the applicability and appropriateness of new emerging architectures.   Finally, let me take this opportunity to thank the Project Khokha team that has led this effort. Many thanks to the banking participants, the ConsenSys and PwC2 teams, and of course the numerous SARB colleagues and departments that have been actively involved. Special thanks to Mr Edward Leach, the business owner, and to Dr Arif Ismail, Mr Gerhard van Deventer and Mr Anrich Daseman of the FinTech Unit.   With that, I would like to hand over to Governor Kganyago to reflect on the advent of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the emergence of fintech, as well as the SARB’s role amidst all these changes. The team will then take us through specific detail on Project Khokha, its main findings and potential future work.   Thank you.                                                 2 PricewaterhouseCoopers Inc 
Vitas Vasiliauskas: Opening speech - China Financial SummitOpening speech by Mr Vitas Vasiliauskas, Governor of the Bank of Lithuania, at the ChinaFinancial Summit 2018, Beijing, 16 May 2018.*   *   *Good morning, Ladies and Gentlemen,It is an honour to be here today and address you in the opening session of this distinguishedsummit intended to discuss the opportunities that the new financial era holds.I will start with a bright Chinese proverb, which says that ‘opportunity knocks at the door onlyonce’. And – if you allow – I will add a European twist to it: ‘if opportunity does not knock – build adoor’.I believe that in our times, opportunity lies in novel financial technologies. And we – by this I meanboth businesses and public authorities – should act decisively to capture it.Here in China, as far as I know, the doors to innovative financial technologies have been openedquite widely. The country is one of the largest and most vibrant FinTech markets in the world. Itranks among global leaders in terms of capital investments in the industry and enjoys some ofthe most developed epayments and online lending sectors. It is thus no coincidence that one inthree most successful FinTech start-ups worldwide – the so-called ‘unicorns’ – originate fromChina.For businesses, FinTech allows opening new doors not only domestically, but also globally. Let’stake, for example, Lithuanian start-ups: dozens of them have taken the chance to surpass thelimits of the domestic market and jump into international waters. Today we have LithuanianFinTech firms making instant money transfers across the globe and providing internationalmobile payment services, with substantial attention from international investors.In this vein, Lithuania has been pushing actively for increased FinTech cooperation within the‘16+1’ framework, as we strongly believe that formats like this are crucial for unlocking newmarkets and taking most of what FinTech has to offer. We are willing to host a high-level FinTechforum for Central and Eastern European countries and China. I would be glad indeed to see yourdelegation next year in our capital Vilnius.The potential of financial innovationIn terms of FinTech’s potential, I would underline three of its benefits that I find key. First, novelfinancial technologies may boost growth by providing additional credit sources, especially forsmall and medium enterprises and households. It is estimated that by 2024 the global peer-to-peer market will be worth nearly USD 900 billion – growing by around 50% annually. Animpressive trend, indicating the scale of opportunities that alternative funding sources hold.Second, FinTech may help increase financial inclusion. World Bank data shows that around 40%of the global population still do not have access to the formal financial system. At the same timewe have got remarkable examples proving that technological innovations allow underbankedsocieties to skip the step of conventional banking expansion and move directly to the latestfinancial instruments, such as instant mobile payments.And third, by digitalising the financial system, FinTech limits space for the ‘shadow economy’.Due to increased transparency, digitalisation allows authorities to curb illegal economic activitiesmore effectively. With the amount of money laundered globally, ranging from USD 800 billion toUSD 2 trillion on an annual basis, financial innovations can offer substantial gains. 1 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
I could go on about the benefits that FinTech brings, but…I suppose there is no need to prove the obvious, so let us now move to the challenges.FinTech calls for increased flexibilityFinancial innovations alter the way the whole financial system functions. While providing betterquality and more efficient services, FinTech challenges the operative models of establishedfinancial institutions. In fact, more than 80% of actors on the global market believe that theirbusinesses are at risk due to competition from innovators. This suggests that the traditionalplayers either have to change, or face a risk to be pushed out of the market.On top of this, FinTech renders some of the long-standing regulatory practices ineffective. Thismeans that regulators need to become more flexible. If they do not, they risk not fitting throughthe doors opened up by new technologies. To put it bluntly, without adapting to rapidly changingfinancial developments, regulators may find themselves sidelined and unable to meetexpectations. More and more authorities across the world seem to be realising this.Back in 2016, the UK Financial Conduct Authority was the first in the world to set up a ‘regulatorysandbox’. In essence, it functions as a ‘playground’ for testing novel instruments before theyreach the market. This is done under the guidance of the regulator, allowing it to keep up withmarket developments and build the necessary know-how.In other words, such formats serve two purposes. First, they allow innovative start-ups to testtheir ideas and grasp the regulatory requirements. Second, ‘sandboxes’ enable regulators toupgrade their toolkits, aligning them with the new generation of business models andtechnological solutions brought about by FinTech.In recent years, similar formats for regulator engagement with the industry have sprung up widely– from Canada to Australia. Arguably, these developments mark a shift in authorities’ thinking –facilitating innovation instead of aiming to restrict it.In this regard, the idea of developing a central bank digital currency has recently been gainingtraction. The task of issuing a central bank digital currency is indeed complex and requiresextensive long-term efforts. Yet it also offers substantial gains. These include increasedtransparency, more efficient payment and settlement systems and enhanced instruments forfinancial risk monitoring.With more flexibility come new responsibilitiesNevertheless – and here I have to put the strongest emphasis – with more flexibility come newresponsibilities. While becoming more open to innovations, we – I mean both industry andregulators – cannot turn a blind eye on the associated risks.First of all – cyber risks, which, under intensifying digitalisation processes, attract elevatedregulator attention. Financial institutions increasingly base their operations on novel technologicalsolutions, such as cloud computing. This certainly brings efficiency gains. But also makesfinancial firms more vulnerable to hacking and malware, placing vast amounts of data and criticalICT infrastructure in a potential danger zone. Today this challenge is particularly relevant inEurope due to the ongoing regulatory shift towards ‘open banking’.It is therefore no surprise that international standard setters, such as the Bank for InternationalSettlements, have recently become more active in this domain. As a result, today financialinstitutions and regulators are offered guidance – including the recent steps taken by theEuropean Central Bank – that they can implement to enhance the level of cyber resilience. Tostrengthen these efforts, the International Monetary Fund has lately been putting more emphasis 2 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
on cyber risks within its surveillance and policy advice frameworks.Nevertheless, digitalisation-induced risks for the financial system stem beyond cyber threats.Financial innovations also tend to create additional room for ‘shadow banking’ to expand.It takes time to identify and fully understand these new and often obscure financial services,sometimes revealing regulatory and supervisory loopholes. Through interlinkages with otherfinancial institutions, this may eventually lead to a build-up of hidden systemic risk. In otherwords, in absence of adequate regulation, ‘shadow banking’ operations risk putting the wholefinancial system under threat.In the last several years, we have witnessed an increase in scrutiny towards ‘shadow banking’activities on a global scale. It seems that regulators are not willing to take chances and wait for a‘Minsky moment’ to occur on the back of technological innovation. Looking from the perspectiveof international financial stability, this is a highly welcome and reassuring development.Treating FinTech as an opportunity, not as a headacheSo: an opportunity or a headache? Adapting the regulatory framework to ever-changing financialinnovations is not an easy task. Yet instead of treating this as a problem, we should see it as anideal chance. This is exactly the strategy that we are pursuing at the Bank of Lithuania.A couple of years ago, our institution set out on a mission to turn Lithuania into a regionalFinTech hub. The Nordic-Baltic region is known for its highly digitalised economies and financialsystems. Yet Lithuania has managed to stand out as a particularly FinTech-focused and openjurisdiction. Of course, this does not undermine our core mission – to ensure stability andcredibility of our financial system.Looking into specific FinTech-supporting regulatory elements, the Bank of Lithuania is one of thefew central banks globally providing direct access to its payments infrastructure for non-bankfinancial firms. This means that FinTechs can provide payment services across the euro area ontheir own, cutting out the middleman. In other words, innovative financial institutions are placedon a truly equal footing with established banks, fostering competition in the sector.While ‘regulatory sandboxes’ for interacting with new market entrants have become quitewidespread by now, we have taken a step further. Next year, we are preparing to launch a‘technological sandbox’, codenamed LBChain. It will function as a service-based platform forcooperating with private actors both nationally and internationally. The platform’s central goal isdeveloping and testing state-of-the-art solutions based on the emerging blockchain technology.Being a FinTech frontrunner regionally, Lithuania also offers one of the most favourableregulatory environments in Europe. Take, for example, licensing. As we are highly speed-oriented, an electronic money or payments institution licence will be ready in 3 months –compared with roughly 12 months in most other European countries.On top of this, we have introduced a unique ‘specialised bank’ licence, which allows FinTechfirms to transform themselves into banks, but with lower capital requirements. And it is not just aLithuanian licence that you get. It also enables FinTechs to offer their services across Europe,with basically no additional documentation or fees. Such openness and flexibility is what allowedLithuania to take up the role of a FinTech gateway to Europe’s payments and banking sectors.The Lithuanian doorway has been used by FinTechs from a broad set of jurisdictions. Firms withorigins ranging from the US to Singapore have established presence in Lithuania. Recently, wehave also been witnessing elevated attention from China. Several Chinese FinTech companieshave already entered the European financial market via Lithuania, with more currently in theconsultative phase. Yet there is still plenty of room inside. 3 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
Embracing the changeDear Colleagues,FinTech is shaking the foundations of the financial system as we know it. It is also pushing for ashake-up in the regulatory mindset. This is challenging. Yet change is never easy.But it does offer substantial benefits. Innovations create better, more effective financial servicesand facilitate their provision on a cross-border basis. Under the right circumstances, this maygive a new boost to globalisation, which is much-needed in the uncertain times that we live in.To wrap up, I would like to come back to the thought that I mentioned before – opportunityknocking at the door. I am sure that the knock has already been heard – it is FinTech. And this isthe very moment for us to learn to embrace it. If we do not, we risk missing out on what may bethe once-in-a-generation opportunity.Thank you for your attention.   4 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches

     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 2  2   When Lehman Brothers failed in September 2008, the bank was a major player in the worldwide derivatives market.  Its $35 trillion portfolio of both cleared and uncleared derivatives represented around five percent of the global derivatives market.   Following its collapse, Lehman’s uncleared derivative counterparties filed claims totalling $51billion in relation to its derivatives business. In the event, it was four years before the first payments were made to these uncleared derivative creditors, and claims against Lehman’s are still ongoing.  The contrast with Lehman’s cleared derivatives portfolio in CCPs is stark.  Lehman Brothers UK subsidiary had a $9 trillion cleared interest rate derivatives portfolio at LCH, comprising over 65,000 trades.  In the period of extreme market turmoil following the firm’s collapse, it took three weeks, rather than four years, for LCH to hedge and close out the entire $9 trillion position.  It used only around a third of the collateral margin Lehman had deposited at the clearing house.  LCH was only one example of the ability of CCPs to dampen the shock of a major credit counterparty failure. The firm had derivative portfolios at a number of CCPs across Europe, the US and Asia. All were auctioned, liquidated or transferred to other clearing participants by the CCPs in weeks, not years. And, with only one minor exception, this was achieved without exhausting the margin collateral the CCPs held.1   I mention this aspect of the Lehman failure because it illustrates the drivers behind two of the key regulatory reforms we have made as a result of the financial crisis.    First, incentivising and where appropriate mandating the greater use of central clearing for derivative transactions.  And second, putting in place resolution regimes to ensure banks, particularly large, highly interconnected, wholesale market players, can fail without unleashing the disruption that followed the Lehman insolvency.   I want to look today at the progress we have made in the post crisis reforms around derivatives and how we address the risks around the concentration of counterparty risk in CCPs – including what the objectives should be for a resolution regime for CCPs themselves.    And I want to look also at the progress we have made, and the next steps we need to make, in putting in place an effective resolution regime for large banks internationally and in the UK.                                                        1 The exception was HK Securities Clearing Corp (HKSCC) which made a loss to the CCP of approx. USD 20 mn, including cost and expenses. HKSCC announced it would claim this from LEH’s estate.  Source Norman, P., 2011.

     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 3  3   These reforms are of course interlinked.  If banks depend more on CCPs to manage their counterparty credit risk from derivative exposures, they need to be sure that CCPs are resilient and can absorb default shocks, especially at times of market stress.  And CCPs – which exist to reduce risks faced by their member banks – depend on the resilience of their members. CCPs have a major interest in resolution regimes being in place that would allow their members to fail without triggering default and disruption.  Central clearing  The financial crisis exposed complex and opaque webs of bilateral derivatives contracts both between financial firms and with real economy end users.  These were often poorly collateralised or not collateralised at all.   As asset prices fell sharply and concern about counterparty credit worthiness grew, bilateral margin calls acted as one of the main amplifiers of stress.  Increasing and more unpredictable margin calls generated more selling pressure, further price falls and greater uncertainty.  Instruments primarily designed to reduce risk, acted in the crisis as an amplifier of risk.  Greater central clearing reduces systemic risk in derivatives markets and increases the resilience of the derivatives network.   It replaces the complex web of bilateral trades with a more efficient network in which firms can offset positions to reduce the overall counterparty credit risk in the system.  It ensures the robust collateralisation of the remaining net exposures through the margin taken from participants.   And in the event of a default, any losses that exceed the defaulter’s collateral margin held by the CCP are mutualised between the members.   As the Lehman experience illustrated, the centralised, rules-based management of a clearing member’s default by a CCP, combined with the incentives created by mutualisation enhance the system’s resilience and continuity during a stress and brings greater certainty to the default management process for market participants.   Central clearing also brings greater transparency – in the run up to the crisis and during the crisis itself, authorities had very poor visibility over the network of derivatives transactions.  That made it much harder to identify risks and the connections between institutions. 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 4  4   Not all derivative contracts are suitable for central clearing.2  Where clearing is not possible, the post crisis reforms include similar requirements to margin and report bilateral derivative contracts.  But the additional mutualisation and central default management benefits of central clearing, justify in my view, the authorities efforts since the crisis to move derivatives that are suitable for clearing onto CCPs.  These efforts have been successful.  Reforms since the crisis have led to a very substantial increase in the use of clearing services for both exchange traded and over the counter derivatives.   For example, a decade on from the crisis, the amount of collateral covering over-the-counter (OTC) derivative counterparty exposures of global banks has risen by over $800 billion, and the coverage of exposures with collateral has risen from about one third to nearly two thirds.3  This has led to an increase in the amount of collateral available to absorb market moves. For example the total initial margin held by UK CCPs against derivatives positions has more than doubled over the last five years with the average level throughout 2017 standing at approximately £145bn at end-2017.4    And, crucially, the shift to central clearing has led to a major simplification of derivatives networks (see Figure 1).                                                        2 This is because clearing requires an adequate degree of standardisation of a product’s contractual terms and operational processes, sufficient market liquidity to support default management in potentially stressed conditions, and reliable pricing sources to support accurate margining 3 See FBS Chair letter to the G20 (July 2017) http://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P030717-1.pdf 4 For further information see the Bank of England FMI annual report 2017.

     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 5  5   The concomitant of these benefits has been greater concentration of risk reducing activity in CCPs. There is notable concentration amongst the largest CCPs and largest clearing members and there are clear interdependencies between CCPs and their clearing members.5  It would be wrong to see this as some manifestation of “unintended consequence”; it is rather the other side of the simplification coin; an intrinsic part of the overall risk reduction.   Concentration brings its own risks but may still be preferable overall to the complexity that existed before the crisis: returning to a derivatives universe that linked the international financial system together through a far more complex network of bilateral exposures, would in my view be a retrograde step.  But it would be equally wrong to ignore the risks that could arise from higher concentration.  There needs to be extremely high levels of resilience at CCPs and effective recovery and, in extremis, resolution options were a CCP to fail.  So we need to have confidence in the sequential lines of defence that are in place to manage risks and absorb shocks within CCPs and in how resolution might provide a backstop.   Clearing members themselves are the first line of defence  CCPs are not risk-taking entities.  Rather, they are mechanisms for the management and for the mutualisation of their members’ credit counterparty risk.  Their greatest, though not only, vector of risk is the default of one or more of their members.   Ensuring that those members are able to continue to meet their obligations to CCPs is clearly the first line of defence.  There has been a very substantial increase, since the crisis, in the resilience of the systemically important banks that are the main members of the largest CCPs.                                                           55 A recent FSB survey found that exposures to CCPs are concentrated among a small number of institutions.  And clearing member affiliates are also important providers of other critical services required by CCPs such as liquidity and credit providers or custodian and settlement banks.  A small number of entities tend to dominate each resulting network. These concentrations suggest that shocks to one central element of each CCP network would likely have significant consequences for the rest of the network.

     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 6  6   I do not want to go into this in detail today.  But we should not lose sight of the fact that reforms to the banking system, particularly substantially stronger capital and liquidity requirements have bolstered, albeit indirectly, the resilience of the CCPs.6 Equally, if not more important, the resolution regimes now being implemented in major jurisdictions are intended precisely to ensure that a major bank can fail, without the disruptive systemic impact of insolvency and default - including default to the clearing house.  The objective is that debt holders can be bailed in and liquidity provided to restore the bank to solvency enabling it to continue to meet its obligations.   I will return later to the question of how we can have assurance that bank resolution will operate effectively.  The point I want to stress here is that if a major bank fails, effective resolution should prevent default to the CCP occurring in the first place.  The CCP’s own defences  Stronger banks and effective resolution regimes reduce significantly the risks that CCPs face from member default.  But they do not eliminate it.    Like banks, CCPs need to hold resources to absorb default losses.  But unlike banks the great majority of these resources are not the capital of the owners.  It is the resources of its members because it is the counterparty risk of the members that is being managed.  These resources comprise first the margin collateral of the defaulting member, then some of the CCPs’ own capital (their ‘skin in the game’) and then the mutualised loss absorbing capacity of the default funds to which all members contribute.   These resources are considerable.   In 2017, in addition to the £145 billion of initial margin, default funds held by UK CCPs totalled around £10 billion. As a very broad comparison, at the height of the financial crisis the UK Government had to make an initial injection of £37 billion of public funds into RBS and Lloyds.  As I noted at the outset, in the Lehman case, the margin held by CCPs was sufficient to enable the CCP to liquidate, auction or transfer all of the defaulted contracts in a few weeks.  We would need to go much further into the tail of the probability distribution of very bad events to exhaust a CCP’s prefunded resources against default than would be necessary to exhaust a bank’s capital.  If bank                                                       6 The largest cross-border banks are considerably stronger than during prior episodes of market stress. Common equity requirements are seven times the pre-crisis standard for most banks. For global systemically important banks (G-SIBs), they are more than ten times higher. https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/speech/2016/redeeming-an-unforgiving-world.pdf?la=en&hash=7B7AC35CC3017FCD8EF5BE7D5F2D0C4EA22C7E05  
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 7  7   resolution failed, and defaults occurred, it would take the failure of more than the CCP’s two largest clearing members in extreme but plausible market conditions to lead to the exhaustion of the default fund – this is a scenario, in the tail of the tail, which would almost certainly be more severe than those we have seen historically, including in the crisis.    The crisis has, of course taught us, that we need to think about events in the very tail of the probability distribution.  So we do need to ask what happens when prefunded loss absorbency is exhausted and insufficient to cover losses.   Unlike banks, if prefunded resources are insufficient to absorb losses, the CCP does not become insolvent.  CCP’s rulebooks, to which all members agree in advance, allow a further series of recovery actions, in a prescribed sequence.  A CCP could require its members to contribute more resources, it could reduce its liabilities to some of its members, and ultimately it could “tear –up” (i.e. cancel) all or some of its contracts  – in effect the closure of the clearing service.  The sequence of ever more draconian actions, reflect the fact that CCPs are not independent risk takers.  In fact, they should not be risk takers at all.  They are services that, for a fee, manage the risks of derivative counterparty default that their members would otherwise face directly and at far greater cost.  Again, the comparison with banks is instructive. Writ large, the objective of recovery and resolution are the same for systemically important banks as they are for CCPs – to ensure the maintenance of critical economic services during stress.  But the similarity pretty much stops there.  The main challenge with a bank that has exhausted too much of its prefunded loss absorbing resources – ie its capital - is to be able to bail in resources and to reduce its liabilities.    By contrast, if pre-funded resources at a CCP are insufficient to absorb losses, the CCPs is able to bail in more resources from its members to absorb losses.  If that is insufficient, unlike banks, it is able to reduce its liabilities – ultimately to zero.  All of this would happen outside insolvency.  And it would be “orderly”, in the sense that it would be a prescribed sequence of action that has been pre-agreed between the members of the clearing house and within contractual arrangements between clearing members and their clients.  Given the scale of the loss absorbing resources held by and available to CCPs and the fact that their rulebooks provide ultimately for their wind down outside insolvency, some have argued that while resolution is relevant for banks, it is simply not a relevant concept for CCPs.  
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 8  8   I see some force in this argument.  Certainly, as far as loss absorbing resources are concerned I do not believe that it is likely to be justified to require CCPs to hold an extra shot, in the form of bail in debt – to enable them to replenish their own resources.  If, following the default of more than two major wholesale financial market institutions in stressed market conditions, the margin held by the CCP, the default fund, and further cash calls on the membership have been insufficient to meet the losses, we will have gone considerably further into the tail of systemic stress events than we have experienced before or that we require banks to withstand.   In those circumstances, a reload of the CCP’s resources by bailing in debt is unlikely to resolve the problems.  On the other side of the ledger, holding bail in debt would be of no other use to a CCP but could put up materially the cost of clearing.  All else equal, this would be passed onto the users of clearing, reducing incentives to use the risk reduction that clearing offers.  Resolution, however, is about more than access to extra loss absorbing resources.  Its objective is to ensure that when systemic financial institutions get into trouble, financial services critical to the real economy are maintained.  The latter stages of a CCP’s recovery plan that terminate, in the tearing up of contracts, would probably be “orderly” only in the sense that it would be a prescribed sequence of pre-agreed actions.  Given the likely circumstances in which it would be occurring the tearing up of derivative contracts and winding down of a major clearing service could be a significant shock to the system.  In those circumstances, I see a number of reasons why a resolution regime is necessary to provide public sector authorities with the option to step in – if necessary before the CCP has come to the end of its pre-agreed recovery and wind down actions.  In such circumstances, where the actions or inaction by the CCP run the risk of amplifying a systemic problem, it is appropriate that a public authority be capable of intervening to manage that systemic risk and to thereby protect public funds from needing to be used.   In contrast to CCP management who will owe fiduciary duties first and foremost to their shareholders, a resolution authority will have powers and duties that require and enable it to act in the interests of financial stability.  The benefits of stepping in to stabilise the situation could take a number of forms.    
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 9  9   For example, if ‘voluntary’ measures such as auctions were failing and there was a serious risk of financial contagion from margin gains haircutting, the resolution authority could decide it was better to intervene quickly to tear-up a subset of contracts earlier than would otherwise be permitted under the rulebook.   Doing so would return the CCP to a matched book before losses escalated further and before the damage became irreparable.   Losses from the tear-up of positions would still be expected to be allocated in the order contractually agreed in the rulebook without discrimination between counterparties. But the discretions exercised by the resolution authority, such as the scope and price of the partial tear-up or the speed of replenishment of the depleted default fund would be taken with objectives to protect financial stability and subject to public law safeguards.  In taking these actions the resolution authority would have the advantage of being able to coordinate and exchange information with other domestic and foreign authorities and with the wider market in a way that the CCP would not.  This ability to coordinate could be crucial to the orderly management of a systemic event particularly if defaults were impacting multiple CCPs.   An important aspect of stabilising the CCP and the wider market would be to maintain sufficient certainty around the losses that could be incurred in the resolution.   A CCP’s rulebook provides its members with assurance ex ante about the point at which and the extent to which they will be exposed in the event of a clearing member default. It protects them from discrimination in the allocation of losses.  Resolution authorities should similarly respect the CCP rulebook in the allocations of loss.  If, in extreme circumstances, it proves necessary for the resolution authority to deviate from the rulebook, CCP members should be compensated for losses borne in excess of what would have been incurred had the rulebook been followed.  This concept of “no creditor worse off’’ (NCWO) is a central tenet of resolution regimes for banks.  Resolution powers can interfere with property rights and the NCWO protection is needed to constrain use of these powers by the authorities.   In the case of a bank, the test is that no creditor should be worse off than if the bank had gone into insolvency.  For the reasons set out above, the insolvency counterfactual needs to be modified for CCPs; to assume that in insolvency the pre-agreed order of losses in the rule book would be followed.    
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 10  10   Non default losses  Finally, it is important to emphasise that I have been talking throughout about losses at a CCP following default of a clearing member.  This, as I said at the outset, is the main vector of risk for a CCP.  But it is not the only one. Non-default losses can arise for a number of reasons, particularly operational failures, including following cyber attack, or losses arising from the investment of the collateral held by CCPs.    In such cases, CCPs do not generally have recourse to the resources of their members.  Losses need to be absorbed by the capital of the firm and if that is insufficient the CCP faces insolvency like any other firm.  Operational risk has become a much greater concern for CCP supervisors and regulators in recent years and we increasingly need to see higher standards of resilience in the face of operational and cyber risk.  Recovery and resolution regimes for CCPs need to take more account of threats to CCPs from this direction.  Whether this should mean more loss absorbing capital at CCPs, access to member resources in the event of non-default losses or some combination of the two is a matter of ongoing discussion.   But given the role CCPs play in the financial system, we need to think more about how we would resolve a CCP that had suffered a major operational failure, without entry into insolvency.  Similar issues arise in the context of the resolution of systemically important banks.  Having published guidance on resolution strategies for CCPs in 2017, the Financial Stability Board’s FMI Cross Border Crisis Management group is now focused on two issues that remained outstanding; namely the adequacy of financial resources for resolution and the treatment of equity in resolution.  Bank resolution  The Lehman Brothers episode with which I started today exposed brutally that insolvency is not an option for large cross-border banks that perform critical economic functions.       One of the main objectives of the post crisis reforms has been to put in place bank resolution regimes that enable the authorities to stabilize a failing bank by bailing in its debt holders to restore solvency and regulatory capital.  The aim, as I have said, is to enable the bank’s critical economic functions to continue, without taxpayer support, while it is being resolved.  A great deal has been achieved.   
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 11  11   We now have agreed international standards covering the design of resolution regimes, the amount of ‘bail-inable’ resources banks must hold, and agreement with industry participants to ‘stay’ termination rights by counterparties in derivative and repo transactions if resolution is in train. Alongside this we also have international guidance on how to ensure continuity of access to FMIs as well as on the mechanics of executing a bail-in.  The UK now has in place a comprehensive and effective bank resolution regime that implements the EU’s Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) and the international standards.  The Bank of England has been established as the UK’s resolution authority with a wide range of powers to ‘bail in’ shareholders and creditors of failed banks. The biggest UK banks have begun to issue bail-inable debt at scale and are well on their way to meeting the target for loss absorbing resources in resolution.7   Key policies and guidance to firms have been issued, notably on operational continuity and on the internal distribution of loss absorbing resources. Last October the Bank, with the publication of the Purple Book, the Bank set out in detail its approach to resolution and how it would tackle a failing bank.  There is more we need to do, I will turn to that in a moment.  And we should be clear that resolution will not be some painless magic bullet. No matter how well prepared in advance, the resolution of a major bank, if it happens, would be a painful, protracted, and probably litigious, affair.    But we now have made means that we have options today to deal with a failing bank that we simply did not have 10 years ago.  The choice is no longer solely between a disruptive insolvency that damages critical economic functions or bailing out the bank’s creditors at taxpayer expense.   A large part of a bank’s losses must now be borne by shareholders or creditors. This penny seems to have dropped with investors in the larger banks – the implicit public subsidy that the large “too big to fail” banks enjoyed in the price of their debt has been eroded and rating agencies no longer assume that UK banks will get public support if they get into trouble.8    It is essential that the resolution regime is fully credible - to those investing in banks but also to counterparties to banks, including CCPs and to the public at large.   If investors in bank debt know that they will be bailed in if the bank fails, the pricing of that debt will exert discipline on risk taking.                                                         7 The major UK banks on average now have total loss absorbency of around a quarter of their risk-weighted assets (RWAs) compared to an average end-state requirement of around 28% (including buffers). 8 While no measure is perfect, a range of market-based estimates suggest the implicit ‘too big to fail’ subsidy has fallen sharply since the crisis. Estimates suggest that the value of the implicit subsidy has fallen from around £45bn in 2010 to less than £5bn now – down around 90% http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/treasury-committee/capital-and-resolution/written/69208.pdf

And the public needs to have confidence that we have learned the lessons of the crisis: that we have acted to ensure that we have an alternative to the previous crisis where we had privatisation of bank profits in good times and the socialization of bank losses when things go wrong.  For that reason, the Bank committed to Parliament in April 20179 and in the Purple Book last October that from 2019 we would implement public reporting of banks’ resolution plans and our assessment of their effectiveness.  This marks an important transition in the implementation of full resolvability in the UK.    For resolution to have maximum effectiveness, banks not only need to be able to meet the policy standards and have sufficient loss absorbing capacity. They need also to have the capabilities to be ready to implement a resolution, the legal and operational arrangements in place to avoid disruption to customers.  It needs to be possible to restructure a firm so that it can be made viable post-resolution.  So the next phase of work will focus on ensuring that major banks have and are able to demonstrate that they have the systems, documentation, assurance and controls necessary to support their resolvability.  We intend to consult at the end of this year on the detail of this reporting and assurance framework. We envisage that it will require major UK banks to conduct a self-assessment of their resolvability – measured against the policies and standards that have been established nationally and internationally.   In line with our commitment to Parliament, we would then publish our assessment of resolvability for the major UK banks, providing greater transparency over the key judgments of the Bank as Resolution Authority.    In a similar vein the Bank envisages we may require that elements of firms’ self-assessments are made public – this would enable firm-specific progress on resolvability to be made more transparent.  It is important to emphasise that this is the next step in the natural evolution of the resolution regime in the UK.  The Bank has been formally assessing the resolvability of UK firms since 2014.  We do not intend start over again nor that firms should do so. The majority of policies and standards are in place and firms have made                                                       9 Bank of England’s submission to the TSC capital enquiry http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/treasury-committee/capital-and-resolution/written/69208.html 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 13  13   good progress in their implementation.10  We intend that firms should build on the work they have already done.   We will take a proportionate approach to the framework for assurance on resolvability, focusing first on the major systemic UK firms.   We propose to ask these firms to submit the first round of self-assessments from 2020.The timing is intended to allow full consultation on the framework and for the first assessments to reflect changes to firms’ structures that are required for EU withdrawal and ring-fencing.   Self-assessment and transparency should begin at home.   For this reason, the Court of the Bank of England asked the Bank’s Independent Evaluation Office to review the Bank’s work so far to put in place the UK resolution framework and its plans to make the resolution framework fully operational by the target date of 2022.  The IEO report published today acknowledges the international leadership the Bank has given on resolution policy and that we are also leading the way in implementation.   The IEO’s findings support the direction of travel I have outlined here for assessing implementation of the resolution framework.  It includes a number of important recommendations to ensure that we are best equipped to take forward the next stage of the work, including how the Bank as resolution authority can gain the greatest leverage possible by using the supervisory machinery of the PRA to ensure firms prepare for resolution while respecting statutory obligations requiring structural separation of supervision and resolution functions.11   Conclusion   This transparency and public assurance should help in one other key respect. Effective resolution of a globally systemic bank will require cooperation and coordination between a range of authorities in a number of jurisdictions.  These need to have confidence that an effective resolution - and one that treats all jurisdictions fairly - can be carried out by the home resolution authority. Absent that, they may need to take action that would frustrate a successful resolution for the bank as a whole.                                                         10 Two further major pieces of the framework will be published shorty – our statement of policy setting out the requirements for internal MREL, and our final policy on valuations.   11 BRRD (DIRECTIVE 2014/59/EU) – Article 3 – states that there should be “Adequate structural arrangements … in place to ensure operational independence and avoid conflicts of interest” between the supervisors of firms and the resolution authority of firms when the two functions are carried out by same public authority.  
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 14  14   The post crisis international reforms established machinery to enable all relevant authorities to agree and track the implementation of the resolution plans of systemic banks.   Public reporting and assessment of resolvability should act to strengthen further confidence of other jurisdictions in the resolution plans of banks that operate in their jurisdictions. Confidence that an effective resolution of a clearing member can be effected will support a CCP and its supervisor ‘staying’ the default of that member, in line with the international guidelines.  The Lehman episode with which I started is also an example of what can happen without such cooperation and confidence and when there is no resolution option available. The effectiveness with which Lehman’s default was managed by clearing houses was perhaps the only bright spot in a very sorry tale.   I hope I have been able to set out today why the reforms we have put in place on clearing and the progress we have made on resolution learn the lessons of that tale and make the financial system today a substantially more resilient place.       
  1/10    “Thai Economy: The Current State and the Way Forward” Keynote Address by Dr. Veerathai Santiprabhob Governor of the Ban of Thailand Nomura Investment Forum Asia 2018 5 June 2018 / Singapore  Distinguished guests, Ladies and gentlemen, A very good morning to you all. I would like to thank Nomura for inviting me here to share my thoughts on the current state and outlook of the Thai economy.  For today’s talk, I have two main agendas. First, I will talk about the current state of the Thai economy where I will discuss recent developments and its prospect ahead. Second, I will talk about Bank of Thailand’s roles to help transform the Thai economy into one with greater productivity, better economic prospect, and more inclusivity. As many of you know, the Thai economy has weathered several storms over the past few years. On the external front, changes in the political landscape and macroeconomic policies of major economies have brought about not only financial market volatility throughout the region but also greater uncertainty to global trade. On the domestic front, Thailand experienced major droughts and floods that affected agricultural prices and output, and most significantly the passing of His Majesty the late King Bhumibol a year and a half ago that caused the greatest grief and sorrow among all Thais. Yet the Thai economy stood firm and was able to continue expanding steadily, thanks to both sound economic fundamentals and a well-diversified economy which underpinned Thailand’s resilience against shocks. In 2017, the Thai economy recovered markedly and achieved an annual GDP growth of 3.9 percent. Merchandise exports grew 9.7 percent in USD terms, highest in the past 6 years, and was one of the main drivers of growth. The tourism sector continued to perform well, with the number of tourists reaching new highs of over 35 million. The economy is expected to continue a strong momentum this year, with GDP growth in 
  2/10    the first quarter registering an impressive rate of 4.8 % year on year, the highest in 5 years, with private investment growth recording a 3-year high.  Nevertheless, this recent economic upturn is different from the other episodes. Indeed, the GDP outturn and macroeconomic numbers showed strong improvements over the previous years, but a closer look revealed that growth was uneven across different segments of the economy. At the same time indicators such as the unemployment rate and NPL ratios were rising slightly between 2015 and 2017. This is contrary to what you would expect to see when the macroeconomy performs better. Although both unemployment rate and NPL ratios have recently stabilized, their developments reveal that some segments of the economy did not benefit much from the economic recovery. In my view, there are at least three reasons behind these developments.  First, the recovery has primarily been driven by external demand. Hence growth benefits are felt mostly by those associated with the external sectors. The robust recovery momentum on the global scale has resulted in a strong expansion of Thai exports across product categories and export destinations. In addition, the Thai tourism sector has grown consistently with steady increases in the number and quality of tourists. Therefore, it is not surprising to see businesses associated with exports of goods and services enjoying the benefits from the improved external demand. Domestic demand growth, however, is still proceeding at a gradual pace. Despite a continuous recovery, private consumption growth remains well below that of GDP, registering within the 3 percent range. And until recently, private investment growth had concentrated mainly in the export sector. Overall, the large current account surplus of 10.5 percent to GDP last year summarizes the pattern of economic recovery and reflects the imbalance between the external and domestic demand.  Second, the rural economy has been exposed to more adverse shocks than its urban counterpart. Specifically, several populist measures including the controversial rice  pledging scheme were withdrawn, together with adverse weather conditions such as severe droughts in 2016 and floods in 2017 as well as declines in global prices of key export crops especially rubber and rice, all constituted negative income shocks to farmers. In addition, rural entrepreneurs, which are mostly SMEs, tend to be less 
  3/10    productive and might not be able to compete with larger firms who are better equipped with capital and technologies. Thus, larger and productive firms are able to reap the benefits of economic recovery and adapt to changes in the new business environment. Indeed, the difference in business performance between medium-sized and large firms in the stock market has been widening. This is evidenced by several financial indicators including the return on assets and the net profit margin. These developments partly explains why the NPL situation has yet to improve for SMEs across the board, while we see improvement in loan quality among large corporates in the same sectors.  The third reason for the uneven economic recovery is the impaired function of the spending multiplier. Usually, when recovery starts to emerge in certain segments of the economy, the multiplier effect of spending should create positive spillovers to the other parts of the economy, thereby securing a more broad-based recovery over time. However, export-oriented firms which currently spearhead the ongoing economic recovery are capital-intensive. They utilize more machinery rather than relying on labor. Thus, positive spillovers to employment are less prevailing. This partly explains why the manufacturing employment growth has been rather moderate despite strong export growth and pickup in the manufacturing production index.  Furthermore, having a high level of household debt, especially during the debt deleveraging period, dampens this multiplier mechanism. This is because households have to use additional income to service their debt obligations rather than spending on goods and services. While there are signs of household debt being deleveraged, as reflected by a continuous decline in the ratio of household debt to GDP which fell from 79.0 percent in 2016 to 77.5 percent by the end of last year, debt burden remains high especially for lower-income households. Ladies and gentlemen, I have been talking about factors behind the uneven economic performance of the last few years. Going forward, the economic recovery is expected to be more broad-based and I want to highlight a few of these positive developments.  First, export growth, our main growth driver, is becoming more broad-based as growth has now extended beyond larger players. In fact, export growth rate of SMEs 
  4/10    has become more or less on par with that of larger firms. Domestic demand is also gaining traction with a steady growth in private consumption, and a pickup in private investment since the third quarter of last year especially from imports of capital goods. Second, the government has directly stepped up various stimulus measures to support the rural economy. Last year, the government introduced the supplementary budget with a particular focus on local infrastructure development, and the Welfare Card Scheme which aimed to support daily expenditures among poorer households. This year, the new supplementary budget is allocated to vocational training as part of the second phase of the Welfare Card Scheme, development of local community enterprises, as well as water resource development to improve productivity within the agricultural sector. This, together with the increase in the minimum wage in April, will support the rural economy and the well-being of the lower-income group.   Third, the multiplier effects should improve on the back of increasing public and private investment. While some of the government infrastructure projects were deferred from last year partly due to the new government procurement system. This year progress should have a better outlook since many projects have gone through the bidding and procurement processes, with material progress underway. These projects include, among others, 4 of the 5 dual-track railway projects that would greatly improve upon the logistics network between major cities and industrial estates in central and northeastern Thailand. We can expect to see these dual-track railways up and running from 2019 and 2020 onwards. Our Mass Transit System is also being upgraded with 3 new metro lines in Bangkok that will extend from key stations in the cities to residential areas in outer Bangkok. Two of these projects, particularly the Green and Orange lines, are under construction and should be completed by 2021 and 2023, respectively. Other infrastructure projects in construction include the Bangkok-Korat high speed train and the expansion of the Suvarnabhumi Airport which are also expected to be completed in a few years. On the private side, private investment is expected to gain further momentum as evidenced by growing imports of capital goods as well as investment spending in machinery and equipment. This is in line with private credit growth which has picked up since the beginning of 2017.  
  5/10    Given these outlooks, we expect the growth momentum to be more balanced with a stronger contribution from domestic demand. In our March forecast, the GDP growth for both 2018 and 2019 was projected at 4.1 percent. These figures are likely to be revised up given better-than-expected growth outturns in the first quarter this year. Headline inflation in April and May has turned up above the lower bound of our target, which is set at 2.5±1.5%, mainly due to the recent pickup in energy prices. Yet inflationary pressure remains soft overall and we must continue to closely monitor inflation developments once these supply-driven fluctuations fade. Over time, improvement in domestic demand and rising energy prices are expected to bring about higher inflation, although it is likely that headline inflation would still remain below the midpoint of the target over the year. For now, an accommodative monetary policy stance would be maintained to foster a strong economic growth and facilitate the return of inflation to the target. Going forward, the Monetary Policy Committee will closely monitor the strength of growth momentum, inflationary pressure as well as underpricing of risks in the financial system that could lead to financial fragility and financial stability concerns.  Ladies and gentlemen, So far, I have given you an overall near-term summary of the Thai economy. Let me now move on to the second part of my talk which looks further into the backbone of Thailand’s economic growth engine over a longer horizon. In particular, I want to focus on Bank of Thailand’s roles to help transform the Thai economy into one that is more efficient, more productive, and more inclusive.  But before doing so, let me give you a quick summary on a broader perspective regarding the new economic platforms in Thailand which have emerged over the past few years. Chief among them is the new investment platform in the Eastern Economic Corridor or the EEC in short. The EEC, as many of you know, is an economic zone specifically designed to bring about large infrastructure upgrades and provide extensive investment incentives for high value-added industries.  The continuity of this investment platform is ensured regardless of any political changes now that the EEC Act has come into effect since May. Last year, we have seen the value of net investment applications under the Thailand Board of Investment privilege program 
  6/10    grew by 23 percent, almost half of which are investment in the EEC. The high speed train project to connect U-Tapao Airport with major cities within the EEC and two main airports in Bangkok has been announced with the TOR of this project now available for potential bidders. The TOR for Laem Chabang seaport upgrade will also be announced in a few months’ time.  In addition to the EEC Act, various legal amendments and process improvements were implemented over the past couple of years to improve the ease of doing business in Thailand and ensure that laws can be adjusted to accommodate new business practices in a timely manner. With these reforms, Thailand’s position in the World Bank’s Doing Business Ranking improved from 46th in 2017 to 26th in 2018, and we should continue to see further improvements in the ease of doing business in Thailand going forward. Another important development, which provides a strong foundation for digital economy, is the nationwide broadband internet project. Over the past years, the project has brought fiber optics network to almost 25,000 villages in remote parts of the country, enabling access to free-WiFi hotspots as well as home broadband at affordable prices. As such, human capital development can improve greatly through better access to online information, remote education, and online healthcare services. Business opportunity can also be greatly expanded with greater access to online marketing platforms and more cost-effective communication tools. This new and expanded online connectivity is a critical milestone which will bring economic opportunity and productivity to people in the rural area whose potential has been limited by the previous lack of supportive infrastructure to connect with the modern world.   Ladies and gentleman,  Let me now turn to Bank of Thailand’s initiatives to help uplift Thailand’s long-term competitiveness. Thailand is transitioning to a new era of digital payment system and financial technology in which the Bank of Thailand is fully committed to foster.  First and foremost, electronic payment infrastructures must be put in place to realize the full potential of digital economy. Under the National e-Payment Masterplan, last year the Bank of Thailand together with the Ministry of Finance and 
  7/10    the Thai Bankers’ Association launched our new faster payment system – PromptPay – which propelled the wider adoption of e-payment in Thailand. PromptPay is an instant payment platform that links bank accounts to various forms of identification including national ID numbers and mobile phone numbers. With PromptPay, funds can be transferred to a recipient’s preferred bank account in real time and at virtually no cost. This new technology has significantly boosted the usage of mobile banking, and has potential to lead to significant growth in e-commerce in Thailand as well as to radically change the way government welfare payments are distributed. In just over a year since the launch of PromptPay, there are over 40 million IDs registered on the platform and more than 2.7 million transactions a day. The increasing usage of PromptPay also served as a catalyst that eventually led to the announcements of most commercial banks two months ago, to eliminate transfer fees for all transfers through mobile and online banking.  All in all, PromptPay provides a crucial payment infrastructure which opens the door to many other digital payment services. Another initiative of the Bank of Thailand to promote digital payment services is the Thai standard QR code for payment. The Standardized QR Code makes e-payment seamless across platforms regardless of which bank or non-bank service provider merchants and consumers are using. In just eight months since its implementations, more than two million merchants in Thailand now accept e-payment through QR code, and this figure will continue to grow. Having a common standard for QR code will indeed generate benefits beyond payment convenience. The common standard will help ensure that no incumbent service providers has an advantage of locking merchants with their QR formats, and allow new and innovative payment service providers to easily enter the market. The standard will also help facilitate the move towards information-based lending for SMEs as their payment transaction information can be consolidated. Given that the payment standard was developed together with five global credit card companies using EMVCo, it could serve as a platform to enhance financial connectivity in the region. Thai banks and payment service providers have begun to work with partners in our neighboring countries to facilitate cross-border payments using the standardized QR code.   This standardized QR code was a product that went through the Bank of Thailand’s regulatory sandbox. Going forward, there are a few high-impact 
  8/10    technologies or applications which are being developed and tested in the Bank of Thailand’s regulatory sandbox. The first one is an extension of our standardized QR code to include other means of payment, including credit card. This could bring down the number of fraudulent transactions, and markedly reduce the merchant discount fees for credit card payments. The second one is the blockchain technology which we are working closely with the financial industry to apply them to various banking applications. ‘Thailand Blockchain Community Initiative’ was officially announced at the Bangkok FinTech Fair in March of this year. This initiative is a collaboration between 14 Thai banks and 7 leading businesses and state-owned enterprises to utilize blockchain technology in financial services, starting with a pilot project to offer blockchain-based letters of guarantee. This project is expected to become operational in the second half of this year. On a longer horizon, the blockchain technology is also planned to be applied to supply chain finance to improve authentication efficiency which would facilitate real sector activities. Other blockchain related projects in the pipeline include scriptless bond issuance which would significantly speed up saving bond allocation to retail investors from 15 days to 2 days, as well as granting more flexibility for bond issuers. The proof-of-concept of this project is almost complete, and production is expected to begin in the very near future. Another project in the pipeline is the “Project Inthanon” in which the Bank of Thailand and banks will co-develop a new way of conducting interbank settlement using wholesale central bank digital currency or CBDCs. Like other central banks, our goal is not to immediately bring CBDC into use, but rather to explore its potential and implications for back office operations. These efforts should pave way for faster and cheaper transaction and validation due to less intermediation process needed compared to the current systems.  So far, I have discussed the Bank of Thailand’s role as a catalyst for digital infrastructure development and as a facilitator of innovation. One should not forget that our core mandate is being a regulator to safeguard financial stability. To this end, we proposed the new Payment Systems Act which became effective earlier this April. The Act unifies previously fragmented payment laws and regulations under a single Act, and empowers the Bank of Thailand with the authority to both regulate and oversee development of Thai payment systems in a manner conducive to new 
  9/10    payment innovations. Beside the Payment Systems Act, supervisory practices are also being updated to improve and safeguard cyber security risks. The updated guidelines on management of information technology risks of financial institutions were released in December last year to ensure that banks have appropriate governance structure in place and can swiftly respond in the event of cyberattacks. Our efforts also extend to ensuring safety of the payment system, and awareness among both financial service providers and consumers. Let me now turn to another area that is important for our region, which is the promotion of regional financial connectivity. Over the years, the Bank of Thailand has made multiple arrangements with regional central banks to support the use of local and regional currencies in trade and investment. This will reduce transaction costs and mitigate exchange rate risks under today’s volatile financial market conditions. In addition, direct exchange rate quotations for currency pairs involving the Thai baht are now available including the Chinese Yuan, the Malaysian Ringgit, the Indonesian Rupiah, and, most recently, the Japanese Yen.  On top of promoting local currency usage, the Foreign Exchange Regulation Reform implemented last year would further complement regional financial connectivity by making foreign exchange-related transactions more flexible and accessible. To give a few examples, foreign exchange transaction form was completely abolished; qualified companies are now allowed to conduct foreign exchange transactions and hedging based on their own risk management practices without having to request for approval on a transactional basis; commercial banks are also allowed to provide loans in Thai baht to non-residents investing in the region; and the coverage of qualified investors allowed to directly invest abroad has been expanded to include retail investors within a wider range of wealth.  All in all, the outlook and prospect of digitalization and regional financial integration look very promising and the Bank of Thailand will continue to facilitate timely development of new financial innovations while also safeguarding financial stability in an efficient and business-friendly manner to ensure a smooth and successful transition of the Thai economy.    
  10/10    Ladies and gentleman,  I have now come to the end of my talk and let me give you a brief summary of what I have said today. The Thai economy continues to expand at a good pace with merchandise exports and tourism so far being the main drivers of growth. Although growth benefits have not spilled over to other segments of the economy as much as we would like to see, domestic demand is improving and we expect a more robust and more balanced GDP growth this year. On a longer horizon, Thailand is undergoing major transformation with the emergence of several promising economic platforms and the ongoing transition towards a new era of digital financial and payment services, all of which will unlock Thailand’s economic potential, uplift productivity, and bring about more inclusive growth. The Thai government and the Bank of Thailand, in its various capacities, are committed to making these achievements possible.  Thank you very much for your attention.         
 1/5  Keynote Speech “Strengthening ACMECS Integration through Financial Cooperation” ACMECS CEO Forum Dr. Veerathai Santiprabhob  Governor of the Bank of Thailand Friday, 15 June 2018 Shangri-La Hotel, Bangkok Excellencies,  Distinguished guests, Ladies and gentlemen,  Swasdee krub, First of all, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the leaders of the Ayeyawady-Chao Phraya-Mekong Economic Cooperation Strategy (ACMECS) and the organizers for the opportunity to speak at this very important forum.                    I believe the ACMECS and the Bank of Thailand share a common goal, a goal of promoting economic and financial developments to ensure sustainable well-being of our people. Certainly, our region has immense potential from growth perspectives, with abundant natural resources to population primed to embrace new economic opportunities. Just as important is the development of our financial systems to unlock the potential of our people and support growing intra-regional trade and investment. A well-functioning financial system is a critical foundation for us to achieve our common goal. To establish suitable financial environment, financial development policies in the ACMECS region must focus on three key words of productivity, immunity, and inclusivity. Productive financial sector enables efficient resource allocation critical for raising the productivity of the economy as a whole. Maintaining a resilient financial system allows for smooth functioning of the financial market, improves risk management, and keeps systemic risk at bay. And, an inclusive financial system ensures that the benefits from economic growth can be shared fairly across the whole society, fostering stable social and economic environment conducive for sustainable growth.  
 2/5  Ladies and gentlemen, Policymakers must take on the challenges of developing our financial systems with a great sense of urgency. Thus far we have seen integration of the ACMECS economies on various fronts—through economic connectivity in trade and investment and through people-to-people connectivity in migration of labor and tourism. Yet, financial connectivity in our region lags behind developments in other sectors and should be prioritized so that it does not hinder further economic integration.  Fortunately, today we have the opportunity to leapfrog development in our financial systems and regional financial connectivity because of rapid advancement in technology. Not at any point in history have powerful technologies been so affordable and accessible.  For instance, the costs of industrial robots and smartphones are now 30 times and 50 times cheaper than those with similar features just ten years ago. Moreover, there are a diverse and extensive number of software applications as well as know-hows available to satisfy businesses and consumers; many of which can be accessed online and obtained free-of-charge. All of these have allowed for greater adoption of mobile devices as well as emergence of new financial technology platforms. Looking around our region, there are many exciting developments taking place that can enhance our financial systems and strengthen their productivity, inclusivity, and immunity. For instance:  a. Emergence of faster-pay infrastructures and mobile financial services within our region like the FAST payment and Wing in Cambodia, Wave Money in Myanmar, or PromptPay here in Thailand have helped reduce the cost of financial services for financial institutions and the public at large. For Thailand, the PromptPay infrastructure has helped cut down cost of retail fund transfer so much so that most financial institutions now offer online transfers free-of-charge. These infrastructures are critical foundations for which new add-on services can be built upon to support growing e-commerce activities in our region.  b. In addition, we have seen firms experimenting with using alternative online data and machine learning for credit scoring model. A credit 
 3/5  scoring model created from data of payment receipts should help financial institutions better assess credit risks while ensure that borrowers, especially small enterprises, gain funding at a fair price. c. Another initiative undergoing testing here in Thailand is the use of blockchain for cross-border financial transactions. This technology should make cross-border payments more secure, more efficient, and more affordable to businesses and a larger population in the near future. Ladies and gentlemen,  All of these are just some examples of the developments happening in our financial landscape. What is more important is that we must recognize that financial technology is a powerful tool for us to improve on productivity, immunity, and inclusivity. Efficiency in financial services is enhanced, as new payment ecosystem can enable more efficient transfer of funds and significantly lower transactions costs for consumers. It also allows financial institutions to scale-down on the high cost brick-and-mortar model and shift to less costly and more efficient digital services. Meanwhile, resilience is strengthened when financial institutions use payment or online data to better analyze and forecast credit demand and credit risks. Additionally, advancement of technology like biometrics and blockchains can help safeguard financial information and reduce the number and magnitude of fraudulent activities. Finally, financial inclusion is improved as digitization of financial services and platforms allow access through online or smartphone, which can benefit consumers both in cities and in remote areas. Moreover, the ever-expanding universe of new financial services means there are a number of choices and solutions available to fulfill different needs, especially those currently underserved. Ladies and gentlemen, As financial technology can help unlock massive potential of our people, it is now up to us, the leaders and policymakers, to play an important role of “the catalysts,” to pave way for greater adoption of financial technology. On this point, I believe there are at least four key areas that catalysts like us must act together:  
 4/5  First, we must encourage common standards of technologies or platforms to avoid market fragmentation. Having common standards would improve competition and innovation, as they allow easy access for all players, especially small innovative players. A good example of the common standards is the Standardized QR Code for electronic payment here in Thailand, where banks and non-banks can apply the common standard to their applications. The result of which was the remarkable speed of adoption of QR code for payment; in less than one year since its launch, QR code payment is accepted by over 2 million merchants all over Thailand. More importantly, financial institutions within the region have already taken advantage of the interoperability of the QR code by applying the common standard in their applications for cross-border transactions with their partners. We are certain there will be many similar partnerships in the future.  Second, we must establish basic and open digital financial infrastructure so that further innovation can emerge to serve a wider range of consumers. Open infrastructure enables service providers to build value-added services on top at low cost.  For instance, e-payment services were created based on our PromptPay infrastructure, such as bill payment and request-to-pay features. These, in turn, have helped facilitate e-payments for merchants and consumers and improved the overall e-commerce business landscape. Even charitable organizations are able to take advantage of the open-platform with e-donation. Meanwhile, the adoption of electronic payment through a common infrastructure can further create the data essential for information-based lending or for banks to improve on their risk models.    Third, we must facilitate greater convergence of rules and regulations within our region to make sure that existing regulations do not impede advancement of financial connectivity. Efforts are being made in this area. ASEAN central banks are working on initiatives under the ASEAN Banking Integration Framework to make banking regulations more cohesive, aiming at achieving greater consistency with international best practice.  Meanwhile, aiming to enhance connectivity, since June of last year the Bank of Thailand has undertaken Foreign Exchange Regulation Reform to relax 
 5/5  rules on foreign exchange controls and make foreign exchange-related transactions more digital, flexible, and accessible. To give a few examples, foreign exchange transaction forms were completely abolished, which should reduce document-related burden for the private sector; the working scopes of money changers and money transfer agents are expanded so that they can better facilitate retail cross-border transactions; and commercial banks can now provide direct Thai Baht loan to non-resident companies established in the Greater Mekong Sub-region (GMS). These efforts will improve connectivity as well as ease of doing business in our region. Fourth, we must foster greater cooperation on cyber security to ensure resilience of our financial systems. Arising with new forms of financial technology is our increased reliance on data transmitting devices and data usage; these come with greater risks of cyber threat. And, globally the number of threat incidents have been rising. Cyber security should be one, if not, the top priority for catalysts like us going forward. Ladies and gentlemen, The Bank of Thailand looks forward to working closely with other central banks, government agencies and, very importantly, private sector participants in the ACMECS region to support adoption of financial technology to promote economic and financial developments. With the affordability and availability of many powerful financial technologies, there is no better time for us to improve on our productivity, immunity, and inclusivity so that we can ensure sustainable improvement in the standard of living our people. I am certain the contributions from the ACMECS leaders present here today will go a long way towards fulfilling our common goal. Thank you very much for your kind attention.    
“Rising Above Disruptions: A Call for Action” Keynote Remark by Dr. Veerathai Santiprabhob Governor of the Bank of Thailand National Directors Conference 2018 Thai Institute of Directors 21 June 2018, Plaza Athenee Hotel, Bangkok Thailand  Dr. Bandid Nijathaworn,  Mr. Andrew Sheng, Secretary General Rapee Sucharitakul, Chief executives,  Directors,  Distinguished guests,  Ladies and gentlemen.  A very good morning to you all. First of all, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the Thai Institute of Directors (IOD) for inviting me to be a part of this exciting and important event. I have always had strong appreciation for IOD’s mission and work to improve director professionalism and corporate governance in Thailand.  I would also like to commend the IOD on organizing this year’s conference with a proactive and forward looking agenda that goes well beyond its focus on corporate governance. This year’s conference program concentrates on areas that we need to collaborate to ensure the future success of our country. It is therefore such an honor to be here today to share my thoughts with distinguished directors and key leaders who play an integral role in driving Thailand forward.   Ladies and gentlemen,  
 2  We are living in an unprecedented period of profound changes where exponential advancement in technologies is transforming everything we know. The speed, scope and impact of this technological change are unlike anything we have experienced before. It is disrupting and transforming the whole value chains, across all sectors in all corners of the globe, at an extremely fast pace.  The effects of this digital revolution are far reaching. We have seen it affecting a wide spectrum of industries ranging from agriculture to automobile, encompassing a broad range of professions from farmers to financial professionals. Drones can now be used to monitor agricultural yields and provide logistic services.  Artificial Intelligence (AI) can now predict certain forms of cancer more accurately than doctors and enable cars to be self-driven. From 3D printing, to genome mapping, to Internet of Things (IoT) and, very soon, Internet of Everything, the possibilities are limitless.  As a country, how we respond to these challenges will determine Thailand’s position in the world economy and the path our future generations take. Of course, no one can accurately predict where this path of technological advancement will lead us to and how our digital future will unfold, but what we can be certain of is that traditional ways of conducting businesses have been upended and leaderships are being challenged. Board members and executives are faced with strategic risks that could threaten viability of their organizations if they do not make timely changes to their business models to remain relevant and competitive. Equally important is how to manage risks associated with this digital transformation. As all directors know well, executing successful strategic transformation is not an easy task.  Executing successful digital transformation when the ecosystem is still evolving will be even more challenging.    Ladies and gentlemen, Amidst these rapid technological advancements, I believe everyone here agrees that a wait-and-see strategy is inadequate. Hence, I very much concur with the conference’s theme of “A Call for Action.” It takes courage to lead a transformative 
 3  journey into an unknown territory. The collective wisdom shared among directors here will enable all of us to make better informed decisions and lead our organizations, and more importantly, lead Thailand, onto the right path – the path which will rise above disruptions, as the IOD has eloquently put it. As Thailand embarks on the journey for digital transformation, we must focus on three key imperatives of productivity, immunity, and inclusivity. Technological advancement provides tremendous opportunity for us to uplift these three areas like never before. While policymakers and regulators can provide support at the infrastructure level and promote a stable environment conducive for innovation, it is at the firm level that actions can be and must be taken to drive meaningful changes for the country as a whole.  First, on productivity: uplifting the country’s productivity is necessary to ensure continued long-term economic growth. Specifically, structural changes due to an aging workforce have hastened the need for our country to improve productivity just to maintain output level. In fact, Thailand’s labor productivity growth has been on a decline. From 2002 to 2017, our annual growth of labor productivity averaged 2.9 percent, a significant drop from an average of 5 percent during 1986 to 2001. In contrast, countries such as China and Indonesia have been experiencing rises in productivity growth.  Should this trend continue, Thailand will not be able to maintain its competitiveness and output level.  Fortunately, many technological advancements available at much lower costs today hold huge promises for raising productivity. Cloud computing, robotics and automation have allowed businesses to save significant costs. Big data, artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities can now offer insights that enable more targeted services. I urge you all to seize this opportunity and leverage on new technologies to improve the productivity of your firms, your industries, and eventually our country.  Second, on immunity: for growth to be sustainable we must have sufficient immunity to withstand unexpected shocks. We are living in a time of great changes, where outcomes can be sudden, unpredictable, and volatile, bringing 
 4  with them new forms of risks. Not only will firms face risks related to strategy, finance, and operation, but they will also face risks associated with driving digital transformations. Managing the transformation process in the digital environment requires fostering an organizational culture that is agile and nimble—to gain flexibility and speed that drives productivity and innovation. But, at the same time, a strong culture on risk management must also be instilled to safeguard firms’ resilience.    As industries increasingly rely on data and data-driven technologies, cyber security must be considered a top priority. Globally, the number of threat incidents have been rising, with increased frequency, sophistication and scale of their impacts. For instance, in 2010 McAfee Labs recorded about 60,000 new malwares per day, but by 2017 that number had risen almost ten folds to 500,000 or about 350 new malwares per minute. It is also estimated that the cost of cybercrime will be in excess of USD 600 billion this year. As such, organizations must build up sufficient cyber resilience by putting in place safeguards to improve threat prevention and detection and ensure preparedness for response and recovery should a cyber attack occur.   Third, on inclusivity: economic development without fair distribution can induce social and economic instabilities, threatening long-term sustainable growth. This is one area we must improve as a country. According to Credit Suisse Global Wealth Report, 58 percent of the nation's wealth is controlled by the richest 1 percent of the people. Meanwhile, 61 percent of land is owned by the top 10 percent of the land owners, and three quarters of the population do not own any land. Like previous industrial revolutions, the digital revolution brings with it challenges in income and wealth distribution, as those with higher skills and access to capital are much more likely to reap the benefits and get larger pieces of the pie. This calls for increased efforts to address this issue to make sure that no one is left behind.  If this issue is neglected, the digital divide will widen inequality gap even further. 
 5  Ensuring easy and affordable access to technology and innovation can help reduce inequality and promote Thailand’s inclusivity. Lower-income groups and people in remote areas need to have access to quality services essential to improving their welfare, such as education and banking services. It is therefore crucial that basic infrastructures are put in place starting, for instance, with national-wide internet broadband access points and the PromptPay electronic fund transfer system.   Moreover, these infrastructures must be interoperable and open to all, which would definitely require collaboration of the whole industry, not just an effort of any one firm. Our PromptPay infrastructure was the result of close collaboration between the Bank of Thailand and the Thai Bankers’ Association. It has spurred healthy competition amongst banks, catalyzing enhancement in the e-payment landscape such that it provides increased opportunities for many small merchants and consumers. Another important factor for inclusivity is digital literacy. It is imperative to equip people with necessary skills to survive and thrive in this digital era. This is an enduring task and one that requires active participation at every level. This effort can begin with individual staff in one’s own organization—working from tech-savvy juniors to technologically-challenged peers.      Ladies and Gentlemen, I believe the three key imperatives of productivity, immunity, and inclusivity will help Thailand navigate through this digital disruption and continue on the path for sustainable economic growth. Before I end my remark this morning, I would like to emphasize once again that while this new digital ecosystem is still evolving and the future remains uncertain, we cannot afford to hold back. We must strategically adapt and adopt technologies now to remain relevant and competitive and provide support for sustainable improvement in the standard of living of the Thai people.   
 6  In closing, I would like to congratulate the IOD once again for fittingly organizing this Call for Action conference. Actions taken at the firm level can determine the direction of our country and whether we can efficiently catch up with rapid technological changes. These changes will also inevitably affect the whole ecosystem of Thailand.  Therefore, I urge you all to think on a bigger picture on how your firms can help make Thailand’s digital transformation successful and fruitful.  So, think big, stay informed, and act wisely. Only then we can be certain that together we could truly rise above disruptions. Thank you for your attention.  *********  
Gent Sejko: Albania's economic and financial developments in 2017Introductory statement by Mr Gent Sejko, Governor of the Bank of Albania, presenting the AnnualReport 2017 to the Parliamentary Committee on Economy and Finance, Tirana, 17 May 2018.*   *   *Honourable Speaker,Honourable Members of ParliamentThe Bank of Albania views the accountability process as an essential element in its activity. Thisprocess complements our institutional independence, enhances transparency and reliability ofthe Bank of Albania and improves the effectiveness of our policies.Therefore, I have the pleasure of presenting today the work and the achievements of the Bank ofAlbania in 2017.I would like to start my reporting with three key messages that reflect the conclusions of ouranalysis and have been the common thread in our public communications over the past year.First, the economy and financial system in Albania marked progress during 2017. The positivedevelopment trend is illustrated by the acceleration of economic growth pace, upswing inemployment and decline in unemployment, and the improvement of financial balance sheets ofthe public and private sectors. This progress has brought our economy closer to its potential andhas strengthened short and medium-term factors that support economic growth.Second, the activity of the Bank of Albania in the past year has been in line with our legalobligations and the Recommendations of the Parliament. Our policy and instruments have had apositive, across-the-board contribution to our activities:Promoting economic growth, through an accommodative monetary policy stance;Strengthening financial stability, through a prudent and proactive supervisory and regulatorypolicy;Fostering development and enhancing financial system efficiency, through continuedfinancial education, and cooperation and joint initiatives with other foreign and domesticagencies and partners.Third, I would like to draw the attention on the fact that, albeit positive development outlook, theAlbanian economy continues to face medium and long-term development challenges.Identification and mitigation of economic and financial vulnerabilities, prevention of potential risks,and continuation of structural reforms to accelerate the growth pace, are among the mainchallenges we face. Our duty, as policy makers, is to draft and implement action plansconsistently and persistently, in order to duly address all the problems we face.Let me now explain these issues in greater detail the issues, starting with a general overview ofkey economic and financial developments in the past year. 1. Albanian economy and financial system in 2017Year 2017 marked progress for the Albanian economy and financial system.According to INSTAT data, the volume of economic activity grew 3.8% in 2017, registering apositive dynamics compared to 2.2% and 3.4% growth rates recorded in 2015 and 2016. 1 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
The economic activity expanded on a broad base and was underpinned, from the perspective ofaggregate demand, by the growth in consumption, investments and exports. Economic growthbenefitted from the improvement in the external environment, and was supported by thedomestic favourable financing conditions and economic agents’ confidence.From the sectoral perspective, the expansion of aggregate demand contributed to the growth ofactivity mainly in the services sector and in certain branches of the industry sector. A notabledevelopment in 2017 was the positive performance in tourism, which provided a positive impulseto economic growth.Owing to economic growth, 79 thousand new jobs were created in the private non-agriculturalsector. Total employment increased by 3.3% in 2017, driven largely by the increase in theservices sector. In parallel to the increase in employment, the unemployment rate fell, from14.2% at the end of 2016, to 13.4% at the end of 2017.Inflation has trended upward in 2017, averaging 2.0% from 1.3% in the previous year. The uptickin inflation reflected the improvement of economic activity and strengthening of domesticinflationary pressures. Yet, this indicator continues to undershoot our target, reflecting thepresence of spare capacities in the economy, the low inflation rates in our trading partners andthe appreciated exchange rate.The expansion of economic activity is accompanied by the improvement of some of the maineconomic and financial balances for Albania.  Thus:The current account deficit decreased at 6.9% of the GDP in 2017, from 7.6% recorded inthe previous year. Its improvement reflected the growth in tourism and other services of thebusiness.Fiscal indicators registered consolidation, reflected in a low level of the budget deficit and inmaintaining control over public debt.Lastly, the financial situation of enterprises has been improving, as illustrated by their highliquidity levels and the progressive decline in the non-performing loans ratio.Interest rates in the financial markets remained low and soundness indicators of the bankingsystem have been improving. The Albanian banking system maintained good levels of liquidity,and improved the profitability and capitalisation indicators. The Capital Adequacy Ratio recorded16.6% at the end of 2017, upward by around 0.2 percentage point from a year earlier. As at endof 2017, the share of banking sector assets stood at 92.5% of the GDP.The activity of the banking sector was stable, reducing the risks to financial stability. In particular,the credit risk marked significant reduction in this year. The ratio of non-performing loans fell to13.2% at the end of the year, down by around 5 percentage points from a year earlier. Theliquidity risk in banking activity continues to be low, while the banking system exposure to marketrisks remains present and subject to monitoring.The improvement of the cyclical position of Albania and the encouraging signals on theeconomic growth outlook have also reflected the results of the work of the Bank of Albania. Letme explain in greater detail.2. Bank of Albania activity highlights in 2017The activity of the Bank of Albania has been and remains oriented toward fulfilling our missionand legal obligations.  Regarding the operational aspect, our activity in 2017 was guided by theMedium-term Development Strategy 2016–2018.The two main aspects in our activity were monetary policy and banking sector supervision andregulation. 2 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
The monetary policy of the Bank of Albania continued to maintain the accommodative stanceduring 2017, in the presence of still incomplete utilisation of production capacities and weakinflationary pressures. The monetary stimulus was transmitted through maintaining the policyrate at the lowest historical level, at 1.25%, increasing the volume and average duration of theliquidity injected in the interbank market and the forward guidance tool.The positive effects of the monetary policy were present in several aspects.First, in lower costs of financing consumption and investments. The volume of lek credit tothe private sector increased by 7.2% in 2017, providing the main contribution to total creditgrowth.Second, in reducing uncertainties of economic agents, encouraging them towardconsumption and investments.Third, in mitigating appreciation pressures of the exchange rate, contributing to theimprovement of the balance of trade exchanges and further growth of economic activity.Fourth, in strengthening of financial stability. The financial environment with low interestrates has improved the financial balances of borrowers, through boosting aggregatedemand, easing the service cost of debt, as well as encouraging the restructuring of existingloans.Our assessments on the monetary policy impact show that its contribution to economic growthfor 2015, 2016 and 2017 is around 0.2, 0.4 and 0.7 percentage points, respectively.Also, the Bank of Albania has continued the efforts to improve the monetary policy transmissionmechanism. Throughout 2017, we have worked on three main aspects:First, promoting the use of the national currency.The high euroization renders the monetary policy pass-through more difficult, as it exposes theprivate agents and the financial system to exchange rate volatility.  Aware of this fact, the Bank ofAlbania, the Ministry of Finance and Economy and the Albanian Financial Supervision Authoritysigned a Memorandum of Cooperation “On increasing the use of the national currency (ALL) inthe Albanian financial system and economy”. In this memorandum, the signatory institutionscommit to identifying and undertaking actions within their area of competence. In this framework,the Bank of Albania identified a package of measures, following the consultations with thebanking industry, and which shall enter into force over the second half of 2018.Second, enhancing the appetite of banks to expand lending.Banks’ appetite for lending continues to remain relatively low, by reflecting the effect of twofactors: (i) deleveraging policies for reducing exposure in the countries of the region, includingAlbania, implemented by parent banks from the euro area; and, (ii) perception of credit risk athome. The Bank of Albania, to address this issue, has continued the collaboration with theEuropean Banking Authority Supervisory College, to exchange information and harmonise thesupervisory policies. Also, our institution continues to implement the measures set out in thenational plan for reducing the non-performing loans and improving the lending environment.Third, fostering the development of financial markets and expanding the range of financialinstruments.In 2017, the Bank of Albania, the Ministry of Finance and Economy and the World Bank exploredoptions for developing the secondary market of Government securities and improving thefunctioning of the primary market. This project will help to: increase the Government securitiestrading; enhance the investors’ base, and better manage the liquidity. 3 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
Regarding the financial stability, the Bank of Albania has continued to implement a prudential andpro-active regulatory and supervisory policy.In 2017, fourteen full-scope and partial examinations were performed in banks, non-bank financialinstitutions, and savings and loan associations. The examinations showed that the performanceof the banking sector improved in terms of: the quality of internal policies and theirimplementation; the establishment of adequate risk management processes; and, theimplementation of the supervisory regulatory framework. Moreover, the non-bank financialinstitutions are assessed to have still space to ensure proper effectiveness, independence andauthority.  The supervisory practice improved, regarding the methodology for banks control, theapproximation of standards with Basel principles and the efforts to adopt the best internationalpractices.Particular attention was given to the consolidating processes and strategic plans of the bankingsystem.Also, the Bank of Albania, in 2017:compiled and approved the Macro-prudential Policy Strategy, which orients the use ofregulatory instruments for enhancing the financial stability of Albania;prepared the regulatory framework on the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment, compiledin the light of Basel principles and EU directives. The Internal Capital Adequacy AssessmentProcess complements the supervisory perspective with the self-assessment dimension ofbanks;made significant changes regarding the prevention process of money laundering, throughthe revision of the relevant regulatory framework;continued the work for the revision of the supervisory methodology on the assessment of thecorporate governance in banks; of the functioning and independence of their committees; ofthe internal audit structure in assessing the risks and their functioning. In this project, wepartnered with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.Notwithstanding the progress made in reducing the non-performing loans, attention has beenpaid to the achievement of banks’ annual objectives regarding non-performing loans and thecompilation of the Recovery and Resolution Plans for larger borrowers. Banks report regularly tothe Bank of Albania on the level of their relations with every borrower, as well as the expectationsand plans on future developments, in compliance with our requirements. With assistance fromthe World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, a regulatory framework, aiming to fosterbanks collaboration and coordination for addressing common borrowers, is being compiled.The Law ‘'On the recovery and resolution of banks in the Republic of Albania” entered into forcein 2017. This Law designates the Bank of Albania as the Resolution Authority for banks andbranches of foreign banks that conduct their activity in Albania.  This Law is another step towardadopting the European standards in the regulatory framework of the Bank of Albania. In its role asthe Resolution Authority, the Bank of Albania increases the security of the banking system.In parallel with the above-mentioned aspects of its work, the Bank of Albania has paid attentionand has worked to: strengthen the development of the payment system; improve the proceduresand modalities for foreign reserve management; improve communication with public; deepen theresearch work; expand and improve statistics; increase financial literacy and financial inclusion;collaborate with domestic and international institutions.I would like to highlight that Bank of Albania has been attentive not only to realising the legalobjectives, but also to strengthen its institutional governance. In this context, the Medium-termDevelopment Strategy of the Bank of Albania, together with the medium-term budget, wasupdated in 2017. For the first time, the capital expenditures and the projects included in the 4 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
budget were preliminary approved by the Capital Expenditure Committee. Also, the AuditCommittee continued the work throughout 2017. This committee conducts a monitoring functionindependently from the Bank of Albania management. In 2017, the Supervisory Council approved,for the first time, the level of tolerance to the operational risk at the Bank of Albania. It will help theefficient risk management, through the early identification and management of operational risk, inline with the established procedures.We deem that the implemented policies and the undertaken measures have served to promotingmonetary and financial stability, by contributing to safeguarding the economic and financialbalances, necessary for a sustainable economic growth.Honourable Speaker,Honourable Members of Parliament,As I stated at the beginning of my speech, the development perspective of Albania remainspositive.  Nevertheless, we have and will continue to face challenges, which should beaddressed with courage, vision and determination.At the end of my presentation, allow me to present the vision of the Bank of Albania on the futureof the economy and financial system, as well as on adequate development policies.3. Development perspectives and challengesSupported by the favourable financing conditions, the further recovery of global economy and thestrengthening of confidence in economy, the cyclical improvement of the Albanian economy isexpected to continue in the medium-term horizon in the next two-three years. The growth ofaggregate demand will encourage the further increase of employment and a faster rise in wages.The fuller utilisation of production capacities will enable the return of inflation to target within themedium-term horizon and will help improving the overall economic and financial equilibriums.The realisation of this scenario is conditioned by the lack of internal or external shocks on theAlbanian economy or financial system. Also, it requires continuing the accommodative monetarypolicy stance and maintaining the consolidating fiscal policy trend. These policies’ coordination isvital for strengthening the macroeconomic stability of Albania. On the one hand, it maintains astimulating resultant trend of main economic policies and, on the other hand, it addresses thevarious vulnerabilities.Looking beyond the medium-term horizon, the Bank of Albania assesses that more needs to bedone for strengthening the economic growth pace and increasing the Albanian economy’sresilience against shocks. Though the accommodative monetary policy provides a support in thisregard, it cannot substitute the structural reforms needed for improving the whole functioning ofthe Albanian economy.We deem these structural reforms should address some key issues:Further improvement of business climate, through: continuation of measures to reduceinformality and promote fair competition; a thorough improvement and harmonisation of thelegal framework and law enforcement; and cutting on bureaucracy and improving publicadministration efficiency. The improvement of the business climate is vital for attractingforeign investments and promoting domestic ones.Expansion of markets for Albanian products, through: promotion of Albanian productstrademarks; promotion of regional integration; and acceleration of European integrationprocess.Increase of Albanian economy efficiency, through: further investments in infrastructure,education and health; encouraging the increase of participation in labour force; and 5 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
improvement of business management standards.  Increased efficiency in the economyimplies higher growth rates and higher welfare standards for the Albanian society.Increase flexibility and resilience of the Albanian economy, through: encouraging therestructuring process of enterprises; further improving the supervisory architecture andfinancial system regulation; and increasing prudence for public and private debt indicators. Amore resilient and flexible economy weathers shocks easier and is re-oriented faster todevelopment opportunities.Further expansion and diversification of financial markets, by working in parallel with theincrease of savings in the Albanian economy, for a studied development of other segmentsof the financial market and for the prudent introduction of new products and financialinstruments. The development and diversification of financial markets improves access tofinance, by increasing the base of potential entrepreneurs and by providing a bettermanagement of personal finances. Also, it improves the financing structure of the Albanianeconomy and paves the way to the development of the country, in non-distant future, when,potentially, the role of banks and banking industry will be more reduced.The Bank of Albania deems that the European integration process should be the guiding anchorto all development policies of the country. The pursuit of this objective requires collaboration andenergies by all the relevant actors in this process, implying their willingness to afford the costs ofthe necessary policies and reforms for the integration of the country.***Honourable Speaker,Honourable Members of Parliament,Concluding, I would like to assure you that the Bank of Albania remains committed to complyingwith its legal objectives, and to fulfilling our institutional tasks and engagements.Thank you for your attention! 6 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
    23.05.2018 “Strengthening the economic governance of the euro: short-term priorities and the long-term view” High Level Seminar. Banco de España  Luis M. Linde Governor  

  3/5 Ladies and Gentlemen,  Let me first extend a warm welcome to you all to the Banco de España. Thank you for joining us today in this seminar that addresses the pressing and very important topic of the Economic Governance of the Euro: Short-term Priorities and the Long-term View.  I would like to thank the panelists who have been so kind to accept our invitation; we are very pleased to have among us a long list of distinguished participants that would certainly throw much welcomed light on the discussion.  The timing of this conference is particularly relevant. After years of low growth, Europe is now experiencing a robust recovery which opens up a window of opportunity to make progress in the governance reform agenda before the next economic downturn unfolds. Supported by expansionary monetary policy, real GDP in the Euro Area has expanded for 19 quarters in a row. Stronger price dynamics are yet to materialize, but we are confident that if we are prudent, patient and persistent, our monetary policy measures will be effective in achieving the medium-term goals.  Price stability is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for achieving sustained and balanced growth. In fact, one important lesson we can draw from the first twenty years of the EMU is the need to improve the area’s resilience to large macroeconomic shocks and to increase its stabilization capacity.  In this context, we currently find ourselves at a crossroads in what refers to the pace of the governance reform agenda.  Despite evident progress since the peak of the crisis, the building of a more cohesive monetary union, as proposed in the Van Rompuy’s Report of June 2012 (the so-called Four Presidents’ Report) and in the Juncker’s Report of June 2015 (the so-called Five Presidents’ Report), is, we all know that, a very difficult task. As a matter of fact, there has been no significant step forward since the establishment of the Single Resolution Fund in June 2014.  Recently, several initiatives have attempted to re-launch the debate on the future of euro area’s governance, including, in December 2017, the European Commission’s report on “Further steps towards completing Europe's Economic and Monetary Union: A roadmap”, or, in January of the present year, the Center for Economic Policy Research’s report on “Reconciling risk sharing with market discipline: A constructive approach to euro area reform”, which, as many of you probably know, we discussed in a recent seminar here at the Banco de España.   The package of reform measures put forward by the EC cover a broad set of issues, from the completion of the Banking Union and the design of mechanisms that reconcile market discipline and risk sharing to the establishment of a European Union Finance Minister. The panelists today will share their views and analysis on these central issues. Let me briefly reflect upon them.  The Euro-Summit on 15th December 2017 resulted in a renewed political commitment to foster further progress on EMU´s architecture during the first semester of the present year. The aim was to trigger the necessary discussions and achieve material progress in the 
 4/5  months preceding the closure, in spring 2019, of the current legislature of the European Parliament.  Our political leaders assigned priority to the completion of the Banking Union, with the establishment of a common fiscal backstop for the Single Resolution Fund, and the introduction of a common European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS) with eventual full risk mutualisation. Both are essential elements to severe the links between banks and sovereigns and to bolster the ability of the area to deal with large macroeconomic shocks. The development of the Capital Markets Union is surely another key project that deserves to be mentioned at the top of the political agenda. Leaders also agree on the need to reduce risks in banks’ balance sheets, including –but not only- the stock of non-performing loans, which is still too large in some jurisdictions. Current proposals to create Sovereign Bond-Backed Securities (SBBS) could contribute to reduce current home-bias in bank´s sovereign holdings if accompanied by regulatory reforms that ensure acceptance by investors. But these reforms should be carefully calibrated to avoid hindering liquidity and price formation in sovereign bond markets. But there are other issues that will require more time to agree and to put in motion. As most of the empirical evidence points out, risk sharing channels are substantially weaker in the euro are than in other monetary unions, but also when compared with large countries inside the euro area, so that a larger share of idiosyncratic or national shocks to income cannot be smoothed out. Upgrading the efficiency of risk-sharing channels, both private and public, and better exploiting the synergies among them would provide the euro area with the shock-absorption capacity and the improved access to cross-border equity finance that is currently lacking.  On the fiscal front, the euro area needs to achieve eventually a more complete fiscal union. Some form of semi-automatic cyclical insurance mechanism against asymmetric shocks could be designed to make it possible more risk-sharing without entailing permanent transfers between countries. Depending on modalities, such an instrument could also contribute to smooth aggregate shocks, achieve a more balanced policy mix and increasing sharing responsibilities with monetary policy. In addition, the EU rule-based fiscal framework needs to gain in simplicity and transparency. Recent proposals, which seek to give greater weight to public debt as a medium-term anchor and to the expenditure rule as an operational tool, deserve consideration. At the same time, increased national ownership should be fostered by enhancing the oversight role of independent fiscal authorities. The aim being to generate enough room for maneuver during good times, so that the stabilising capacity of fiscal policy may be larger at crisis times.  In sum, a lot of work remains to be done both in the near- and in the medium-term. These perspectives underpins the agenda of today’s Seminar, which we have organized around two panels.  A first panel, on Short-term Challenges towards a Complete EMU, will discuss the reform agenda that is feasible to pursue in the current European parliamentary cycle (until 2019).  
  5/5 In a second panel, on Long-term Prospects for a Cohesive EMU, we would like to address the medium- to long-run steps necessary to increase the euro area’s capacity to prevent crisis and to manage them.  Finally, Economy Minister Ramón Escolano will close the Seminar explaining the strategic vision underlining the recent proposals on EMU architecture articulated by the Spanish government. The proposals constitute, in my view, a politically realistic program to advance the process of governance reform in the short-term without losing sight of the longer-term needs. The final goal being providing the EMU with a more solid institutional framework that help ensure the prosperity and well-being of euro area citizens and improve the public perception of the integration project.  Now, according to the agenda, I give the floor to the moderator of the first panel, Paloma Marín.   
  Bank of Italy – The Global Foundation Rome Roundtable 2018 Rome, 15 June 2018 Dinner address of the Governor of the Bank of Italy Ignazio Visco   Your Excellences, Ladies and Gentlemen, it is a pleasure to welcome you to the Bank of Italy. I would like to thank Steve Howard, Secretary General of The Global Foundation, for bringing together so many distinguished guests to discuss the state of the world and how it might be improved. I also thank Jock Murray, Chairman of The Global Foundation, for his kind introduction. I am honoured to set the stage for the keynote address by His Eminence Cardinal Pietro Parolin. Unfortunately, I could not attend the sessions of the first day of this meeting. I regret it very much because you have been addressing themes of fundamental importance for the global economy. These themes appear remote from the main tasks of central bankers, preserving price and financial stability, but at a deeper level all the issues are connected and we should not lose sight of the major changes that affect our societies and economies. In January 2017, Pope Francis’ address to The Global Foundation inspired the main theme of today’s and tomorrow’s discussion. He stigmatized “an ideology of capitalism” that shows “little or no interest for the realities of marginalization, exploitation and human alienation, a lack of concern for the great numbers of people still living in conditions of grave material and moral poverty, and a blind faith in the unbridled development of market forces alone” and invited us “to discern just ways of attaining a globalization that is ‘cooperative’, and thus positive, as opposed to the globalization of indifference”. Obviously, I do not have a clear and short answer to the questions posed by Pope Francis, but I do believe that the issue of labour is central. It relates to social integration and personal identity. At the economic level, it should not be seen solely as a cyclical problem: the economy’s growth depends on the quantity and quality of the labour force and on the capacity to provide adequate jobs in these ever-changing times. Therefore, in my remarks tonight I will first consider the main forces shaping our future and the challenges they pose; then I will hint at the traps that – as policy makers – we should avoid in order to move towards the “cooperative globalization” that we are invited to realize. 1  
Over the last decades, four overarching forces have been shaping the world economy: globalization, technological progress, demographic transition and climate change. For the most part, globalization and technological progress have been positive and powerful engines of economic progress and social change. But given their heterogeneous, pervasive and differentiated effects, they have also been the object of fierce critiques and deep-seated fears, which policy makers should not neglect. Globalization is a complex, multidimensional phenomenon, consisting not only of the deeper integration of goods, services and capital markets, but also of the greatly increased mobility of people, information and ideas. The globalization we have experienced over the last quarter of a century could not have been achieved without the technological revolution that today is symbolized by the wide diffusion of computers, the internet, smartphones and robots. This technological revolution is inexorably permeating all aspects of economic and social life. It is radically changing people’s habits and firms’ activities, as well as our way of working, producing, consuming, exchanging information and interacting socially. Statistics concerning the digitalization of the economy tell a clear story: in 2016, about 95 per cent of businesses in the OECD countries had a broadband Internet connection; more than 75 per cent had a web presence; half of the adult population had purchased goods or services online, compared with 36 per cent in 2010. These numbers suggest that, in this digital era, financial, economic and even social inclusion are closely related to technological inclusion. The formidable achievements of globalization and technological progress are too often forgotten as the discussion turns to their shortcomings and risks: − The world economy is today six times larger than 50 years ago, while the total population has increased little more than two-fold, so that average per capita GDP has more than doubled. − Over the last 25 years or so more than 1 billion people have escaped extreme poverty (defined as an income below 1.9 dollars per day) while 2.2 billion have been added to the world population. Therefore, about 3.5 billion people have never entered or have escaped this condition. The target of halving the share of people living in extreme poverty has thus been achieved five years earlier than was established within the Millennium Development Goals agreed in 2000 by the United Nations, notwithstanding the exceptional increase in the world population. − The so-called emerging economies – once excluded from the global economy and hosts for the largest share of the poor – have substantially narrowed the gap with advanced countries and are today the main contributors to world growth. − The mortality rate for children under the age of 5 was halved globally between 1990 and 2015. 2  
− Thanks to greater labour mobility, today about 260 million people live in a foreign country, up from less than 80 million in 1970, and flows among developing countries now exceed those towards advanced economies. However, not everybody has benefited in the same way from the economic expansion provided by trade and innovation. Economic backwardness, poverty and high mortality rates are still dramatic problems in many developing countries, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. Even in the more prosperous countries, many have been left behind. Inequality in the distribution of income has declined dramatically over the last three decades at a global level, mainly as a result of the fast growth of China and other emerging markets that has reduced their distance from the richer parts of the world. However, within most countries differences in income and wealth have risen to historically high levels. Finally, the rapid pace of technological progress and its unprecedented nature make it possible not only to replace physical labour but even to displace intellectual contributions in a variety of tasks once believed to be a prerogative of humans. This has raised fears of a new form of technological unemployment, to which the medium-skilled population is also vulnerable, and has helped to spread a sense of insecurity, raising the demand for protection. The two other factors shaping our present and future conditions – demographic transition and climate change – are not independent from, and have actually been reinforced by, global economic integration and technological progress. Higher living standards and wider access to better healthcare have increased life expectancy across the globe. For the first time in our history, the world faces not only a growing population – estimated to reach almost 10 billion in 2050, up from 7.5 billion today (and 2.5 billion in 1950) – but also an ageing one: there are almost 1 billion people aged 60 or over in the world (13 per cent of the global population) and this age group is growing faster (at 3 per cent per year) than younger age groups. In most advanced countries, as well as in China, declining birth rates, with increased life expectancy, are pushing up the so-called old-age dependency ratio, the population over 64 relative to the working-age population (aged 15 to 64). In Europe, ageing is progressing at a very fast rate: in Italy, the old age dependency ratio has risen from 12 per cent in 1950 to more than 35 today; in Germany, from 14 to 32 per cent. Demographic transition, however, is a global phenomenon: Japan has the oldest population in the world, while in China the dependency ratio has doubled since 1950 and is expected to reach 44 per cent by 2050, up from 13 today. This demographic transition will have a deep and long-lasting economic impact. However, the argument that this impact is inevitably negative rests on the assumption that old people are only unproductive consumers of government benefits. This is not necessarily the case: 3  
− Ageing does not automatically imply being unproductive or sick. A 70 year old today is in many respects much “younger” than a person of the same age 50 years ago and we now have the means to avoid the marginalization of the elderly and to keep them an integral and productive part of society for longer. − While in relative terms the old are outgrowing the young, the number of young people in the world is the largest in history in absolute terms, but it is not distributed evenly around the globe. Of the 2.2 billion people added to the world population since 1990, less than 1 in 10 live in advanced countries. Africa, which hosts some of the poorest countries in the world, is expected to have the fastest population increase over this century, reaching Asia in absolute terms. Only an integrated world economy and wise policies can help to spread the benefits of progress more evenly. This also requires that the flows of migration be properly managed. Climate change is linked to what we have been saying so far. The post-war exponential demographic acceleration – the “population explosion” – prompted discussion of the “limits to growth”. At the start of the 1970s, the Report of the Club of Rome, which centred on the predicted depletion of natural resources, raised alarm about the survival of the earth’s ecosystem and of the human race. These projections received great attention from the media, but they were greeted sceptically by many eminent economists of the time. With some reason, the critics noted that the Report failed to account for two major stabilizing mechanisms: the ability of relative prices to rebalance supply and demand and the endogenous response of technology. Notwithstanding the power of these two mechanisms, which makes any long-term projection hazardous, the concern has not abated. The debate on sustainable development – i.e. development that can “meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs” – suggests that today it is impossible to ignore the environmental balance of the planet and the reciprocal compatibility, or trade-offs, between economic, social and ecological objectives. Climate change is no longer a scientific curiosity, it is a fundamental theme of today’s public debate. A series of important international agreements (the Kyoto Treaty of 1997 and the Paris Climate Agreement of 2016) have made it clear that two aspects are of special importance: 1) tackling the challenge of climate change at a global level, with the cooperation of all the parties involved; and 2) devising incentives for the invention and use of new technologies to drastically curtail emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Globalization, technological progress, demographic transition and climate change present us with formidable challenges. But economic integration, scientific progress and improvements in education and health conditions provide great opportunities for forging a more prosperous, more equitable and more sustainable world economy. However, it must be clearly understood that attaining a “cooperative” globalization entails governing the world 4  
economy, as it would be illusory to rely solely upon unfettered market forces. As the global financial crisis has clearly demonstrated, effective regulation, adequately funded international financial institutions and strong cooperation among nations are necessary to mitigate risk, grant stability and correct market excesses. Unfortunately, we live in unprecedented bad times for international relations. A retrenchment of policies towards narrowly defined national interests and short-termism in the definition of policy objectives, partly dictated by the continuous monitoring of popular approval and facilitated by the new digital technologies, are the most significant risks today. The US decision to back out of the Paris Climate Agreement and the recent failure to sign a shared Communiqué at the G7 Summit in Charlevoix are clear signs of the dangers to the liberal world order and global cooperation. The trade dispute is revelatory of the difficulties we encounter on the road to cooperation. As is well known, the basic economic teaching on trade policy is that free trade is by far the best option as it grants full exploitation of comparative advantages to all parties involved. Indeed, the current trade system based on multilateral agreements underpinned economic development for decades. Obviously we should not ignore the potential complications arising from different levels of industrialization across nations and the risk of specializing in products that might lock in a country at a pre-industrial stage, as may have been the case for much of North-South trade during the colonial period. But we must consider that, in trade deals, the interests of producers and consumers are seldom aligned. Often the benefits of a given tariff or import quota are concentrated in the hands of few well-organized producers, while their costs, no matter how great in absolute terms, are spread among a large number of unaware and unorganized consumers. A similar conflict between concentrated and diffuse interests also arises in the case of climate change, where a further tension is added, the one between current and future generations. A final example of the difficulties we encounter on the road to cooperation is the reaction to migration. Of course, there are many reasons why migration is met with some resistance by receiving communities. While the concerns of the more vulnerable parts of the population must be addressed, we should recognize that international mobility is a positive force for economic and social development: if properly handled, it could help poor countries to grow by alleviating the pressure on their labour markets, and it could ease the consequences of ageing in richer economies, which need a young labour force to balance falling birth rates. But we should not ignore the conflicts that migration may generate. A first one is between the citizens of rich countries, who enjoy a “citizenship rent” they have received without meriting it, and the citizens of poor countries, who try to escape a poverty for which they have no responsibility. A second one is between young people today, who feel their jobs are threatened by migrants, and the same people tomorrow, as a young labour force is needed now to support their living standards in the future. 5  
These are formidable problems that cannot be tackled by policies constrained by geographical borders. The wide-ranging integration of the global economy has brought a corresponding integration of global problems. It would be short-sighted – actually counterproductive – to think that effective solutions can be found exclusively within one’s own territory, following “me first” national strategies. But this is the reality we face. By the same token, an effective solution to these problems requires a longer-term view, a political agenda that is not enslaved by short-termism, since the needed reforms and policies have effects that are not immediate, but are distributed over a long-time horizon. We need to prepare the polity for this kind of intervention, which is now opposed by so many. To shape public opinion, education and information are key. We need to communicate in clear, accessible terms the long-term benefits of openness to trade, to new ideas and to managed migration, while addressing the needs and fears of the most vulnerable parts of the population in advanced economies and in the world at large. 6

Today I'll discuss some of the interesting features of the Australian fixedincome market and how that market has evolved over the years.The Australian financial market is very much part of the global capital market. Indeed, the extent ofthat integration has increased progressively over time. Over the past decade, foreign capital cominginto Australia from the major advanced economies has increased by more than those economieshave grown (Graph 1). For example, as a share of Japan's GDP, Japanese investment in Australia isnow around three times the size it was 10 years ago. [*]

It has long beenrecognised that there are reliable opportunities for overseas investors to profit from investment inAustralian assets, whether they be physical or financial assets. This has enabled Australia to havesustained sizeable current account deficits over the course of the past 150 years or more (Graph 2).

That led to a steady build-up in the ratio of netforeign liabilities to GDP (Graph 3). Over the past decade, net liabilities have continued to increase,but by no more than the rise in nominal GDP, so that ratio has been little changed at around55 per cent. Underneath that overall stability, there have been important changes in the make-up ofthe different types of liabilities, and the different types of institutions drawing upon foreign funding.The share of longer-term debt has increased noticeably, while the share of short-term debt hasdeclined. Also, the net equity position has changed from a notable deficit to one that is roughly inbalance.

While the banks do raise a portion of their debt offshore in order to fund their lending toAustralian businesses and households, the extent of this is much less than in the past (Graph 4). Bycontrast, non-financial corporations have been willing and able to access offshore funding more sothan in prior decades so that they now account for a larger share of foreign borrowing than banks.Also, federal government borrowing from offshore increased as a share of GDP following the globalfinancial crisis. I'll return to this last point in a few minutes, but for now, I'll note that thegovernment debt is issued to overseas investors in Australian dollars, in contrast to offshore issuanceby the private sector in foreign currency terms.

The big shift away from short-term debt towards deposits started around thetime of the global financial crisis. These changes were in response to the demands of the market andthose of regulators for banks to make greater use of more stable sources of funding.

And about 60 per cent of that debt (on a residual maturitybasis) is raised offshore (Graph 6). Global money markets, in the United States and elsewhere,provide the Australian banks with a much deeper market with a wider investor base than therelatively small domestic market. This short-term debt is issued in foreign currency terms, but thebanks fully hedge their exchange rate (and interest rate) exposures at relatively low cost. [1]

Hence, the rise in the US 3-month LIBOR rate (relative to theOvernight Index Swap (OIS) rate) was closely matched by a rise in the equivalent 3-month bank billswap rate (BBSW) spread to OIS in Australia (Graph 7); similarly, the two spreads have declined oflate by similar orders of magnitude (relative to their respective OIS rates). Equivalent spreads insome other money markets around the world also moved higher, though to a lesser extent thanspreads in Australia. In contrast, rates in the euro area and Japan were not affected by the tightnessin the US markets. That difference appears to reflect the fact that although European and Japanesebanks tap into US money markets, they do so largely to fund US dollar assets.
6/7/2018Some Features of the Australian Fixed Income Market | Speeches | RBAhttp://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2018/sp-ag-2018-06-06.html8/19Graph 7Changes in BBSW rates in Australia feed through to banks' funding costs in a number of ways. First,they flow through to rates that banks pay on their short- and long-term floating rate wholesale debt.Second, BBSW rates affect the costs associated with hedging the risks on banks' fixed-rate debt, withthe banks typically paying BBSW rates on their hedged liabilities. Third, interest rates onwholesale deposits tend to be closely linked to BBSW rates.In short, the costs of a range of different types of funding have risen a bit for Australian banks in thepast few months. But they remain relatively low and pressures in short-term money markets haveeased, with BBSW about 10 basis points lower than its recent peak (relative to OIS). While somebusiness lending rates are closely linked to BBSW rates – and so have increased a little – there havebeen few signs to date of changes to rates on loans for housing or small businesses.While developments in global financial markets such as I've just described influence Australianfinancial conditions, the link is far from one-to-one. This is not surprising given that the ReserveBank sets monetary policy according to the outlook for Australian economic activity and inflation, andwithin a freely floating exchange rate regime.So even though the yield on 10-year government bonds in Australia moves quite closely with theequivalent US yield from day to day, over time these yields follow their own paths. Indeed, this yearthe difference between yields on 10-year Australian government bonds and equivalent US Treasurysecurities has become negative for the first time in quite a while (Graph 8). Also, the federal fundsrate has now risen from close to zero a few years ago to be at the same level as the Australian cash [2] [3]
6/7/2018Some Features of the Australian Fixed Income Market | Speeches | RBAhttp://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2018/sp-ag-2018-06-06.html9/19rate. These changes reflect a few important differences across the two economies. In the UnitedStates, the economy has moved beyond what most consider to be full employment, inflation is closeto the Fed's target and expectations are that the Federal Open Market Committee will continue toraise its policy rate; moreover, the United States is embarking on a significant fiscal expansion. Bycontrast, there remains spare capacity in the Australian labour market – notwithstanding strongemployment growth over the past year – inflation is expected to rise gradually towards the ReserveBank's target, and market pricing implies no expectation of a rise in the cash rate until around midnext year at the earliest. Fiscal policy in Australia is also on a different course to the United States,but there are other speakers here today addressing that topic.Graph 8So yields have risen in Australia a bit, but by less than in the United States and they remain low.Spreads have also increased of late, but they too remain at low levels across a number of Australianmarkets (Graph 9). Over the past year or more, spreads declined in response to a number of factors.Accommodative monetary policy and the low rate of inflation have contributed to easy financialconditions for issuers. Also, there has been a noticeable improvement in measures of businessconditions to well above average levels (Graph 10). The resulting improvement in, and outlook for,business profits has helped reduce actual and prospective defaults. In turn, this has underpinned anarrowing of credit premia.

Again, this is consistent withAustralia's open capital markets. Spreads reflect an assessment of risk, and if the price of risk inAustralia were to deviate too far from the global price – beyond that suggested by any differences infundamental credit quality – there would be opportunities for profitable arbitrage. One way oranother, the process of arbitrage would lead to a degree of convergence between spreads.

Banks have taken advantage of favourable funding conditions to tapthe bond market. In 2017, their gross issuance of bonds was the second highest since the globalfinancial crisis (Graph 12). And net issuance this year is currently running well ahead of issuance atthe equivalent time last year.

The Kangaroo market, where non-resident issuers tap the Australian market, isfamiliar to Japanese investors; Japanese pension funds and life insurance companies are activeinvestors here. Activity in this market is important because foreigner issuers typically hedge theexchange rate risk arising from their Australian dollar liabilities. This source of demand helps to keepdown the costs of hedging exchange rate risk for Australian entities issuing liabilities in US dollars(and other foreign currencies).Another place where we understand Japanese investors play an important role is in the residentialmortgage-backed securities (RMBS) market. Issuance in the RMBS market in 2017 was the strongestit has been since the global financial crisis. Part of that owed to extra issuance by non-banks. Theirhousing lending picked up strongly at the same time as the growth of lending by the major bankseased, which was driven, in part, by regulatory actions to tighten lending standards. Despite thesesupply-side motivations, spreads remain relatively tight, consistent with a rise in the demand forRMBS over the past couple of years (Graph 13).

In the RMBS market, low spreads have encouraged more issuance bysmaller competitors to the major banks; last year these numbered 17, which was the highest ever.Also, resource-related companies have been much less active now that the mining investment boomhas come to an end, while companies outside of the resource sector stepped up their issuance tohigh levels last year (Graph 14).

In the case of domestic issuance for non-financial corporations, thisincrease is part of a longer-running trend, which has been a positive development for domesticmarkets. In the case of overseas issuance by Australian banks, there have been some notable dealsof late with quite long tenors. This lengthening of tenor reflects banks taking advantage of the lowterm premium for longer-term funding.
6/7/2018Some Features of the Australian Fixed Income Market | Speeches | RBAhttp://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2018/sp-ag-2018-06-06.html17/19Graph 16While foreign investment in Australia has grown significantly over many years, the share ofgovernment debt held by foreigners has declined since earlier in this decade (Graph 17). Even so,it remains at a relatively high level in the case of Australian Government debt. The share ofAustralian corporate debt held by foreigners has been high and stable, even drifting up in the case ofnon-financial corporations. The recent pick-up in foreign ownership of asset-backed securities isinteresting. It suggests that non-residents have entered the secondary market to purchase asset-backed securities, thereby adding some liquidity to a market that is normally not particularly liquid. [5]

Not surprisingly, developments in major advanced economies have some influence ondomestic financial conditions; the episode of recent tightness in US money markets is one suchexample. However, Australian financial conditions do not move in lock-step with those offshore, withdomestic developments also having a major influence. While Australian banks still play a role intapping into funding offshore, that role is less important than it used to be. Indeed, over recentyears a broader range of issuers have been obtaining funding, in both onshore and offshore markets,and this has occurred at somewhat longer tenors than in the past.EndnotesI would like to thank Leon Berkelmans for his help in preparing this material.[*]About two-thirds of long-term debt is issued offshore.[1]Even though banks issue mostly fixed-rate bonds, and mostly offshore, they swap much of the related exposuresinto floating rate Australian dollar exposures. This aligns the nature of the rates for their funding with those of theirassets (which are largely variable interest rate loans).[2]

However, as time has passed, we have seen amore diverse range of issuers enter the market, including non-European SSAs and more recently non-financialcorporations, such as companies from the United States.[4]Foreign holdings in absolute terms have increased over this period but they haven't kept pace with the growth in thestock of government debt.[5]
Peter Praet: Monetary policy in a low interest rate environmentSpeech by Mr Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at theCongress of Actuaries, Berlin, 6 June 2018.*   *   *Accompanying slides of this speech.salient feature of the economic environment in advanced economies has been the steady declineof short and long-term interest rates over several decades to the extremely low levels whichcurrently prevail. Since 1980, long-term interest rates have declined by about 860 basis points inthe United States, 790 basis points in Germany and more than 1,200 basis points in France.I am acutely aware that an environment of low interest rates poses considerable challenges formany of the business models operated by actuaries and other professionals. However, thesimilar behaviour of yields across different economic areas attests to the global nature of theeconomic and financial developments at work, as well as to the broad similarity of the methodsadopted by monetary policymakers in advanced economies to respond to the adversedevelopments of the last ten years.In my remarks today, I would like to outline the ECB’s monetary policy response to the differentphases of the crisis. Our monetary policy response has taken place in a low interest rateenvironment, which can be attributed to specific global and euro area factors, some of which aresecular and some of which are a legacy of the financial crisis. In any case, the secular trendsand structural forces – which, prior to the crisis, had pushed down long-term yields over a spanof at least 30 years – made central banks’ efforts to stabilise their economies when the crisisfinally hit even more strenuous than they would have been otherwise, and required moreinnovative and bolder measures.Nonetheless, the present environment of low interest rates need not become permanent aspublic policy can address some of the causes of the very low interest rates. While several of thesecular factors are challenging for policy to reverse, others can be alleviated by effective andtargeted policies that boost potential growth and, in the case of Europe, complete the euro area’sinstitutional framework.Monetary policy plays an important role by creating an environment which facilitates thenecessary structural adjustments, even if in itself it cannot address structural aspects of theeconomy. Indeed, by laying the groundwork for a return of inflation to our objective, our monetarypolicy measures have been supporting economic activity and have alleviated damage to theeconomy’s growth potential.Our asset purchase programme (APP) has been the pivotal component of our strategy forcountering and reversing the crisis. As you know, since the programme’s inception in 2015, theGoverning Council of the ECB has made net asset purchases under the APP conditional onprogress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2%over the medium term. We have set forth criteria to measure the headway we have madetowards meeting this stated objective since the programme was launched. Next week, theGoverning Council will have to assess whether progress so far has been sufficient to warrant agradual unwinding of our net purchases. In making its assessment, it will consider the underlyingstrength of the euro area economy and the pass-through to wage and price formations.Monetary policy response to the crisisIn the years preceding the onset of the global financial crisis in 2008, over-optimistic growthexpectations had taken hold in a number of advanced economies. Although productivity growth11 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
had been slowing since the mid-1990s, agents overestimated future income growth andborrowed against it, accumulating excessive levels of debt. At the same time, poor riskmanagement, low capital and liquidity, inadequate corporate governance, and weak supervisionand regulation encouraged financial leverage, which led to the build-up of vulnerabilities. This wasparticularly acute in the United States, where there was a rapid expansion in the development ofcomplex financial securities, which later proved to entail substantial risks.This oversight can to some extent be explained by the fact that, in the decade leading up to thecrisis, the overall macroeconomic environment had been very stable, with some observers evenconcluding that monetary policy had tamed the business cycle once and for all. This was alsothe period when the perceived benefits of globalisation reached their high-water mark and, foreuro area countries, when Monetary Union came into being, potentially paving the way for themacroeconomic and microeconomic benefits of the European Single Market to be fullyunleashed.When the cycle finally turned in 2008, it set in train a turbulent decade of deleveraging and de-risking, consisting of a number of different phases.The first phase was similar across advanced economies. It was characterised by the financialpanic and abrupt liquidity crisis triggered by the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008.Banks became uncertain about the underlying health of other banks, bringing market funding to asudden stop. Globally, central banks intervened forcefully and in a coordinated manner so as toprovide essential liquidity to the banking sector. During this first phase of the crisis, the ECBlowered its main refinancing rate to the then record low of 1% in May 2009, while letting thepivotal overnight money market interest rate drift down to the floor of the interest rate corridor – alevel much lower than 1%. To facilitate banks’ borrowing of central bank funds, the ECBexpanded the range of eligible collateral for refinancing operations and provided liquidityelastically to the banking sector. The easing impact of our liberal liquidity injections wasenhanced by increasing the maturity of liquidity provisions. This phase of the crisis deeplyaffected euro area banks because, unlike in other jurisdictions, no institutional frameworks wereavailable to swiftly address problems.Banks’ needs for fresh resources put a growing strain on the public finances of those countrieswhose banking sectors had been allowed to grow to outsized proportions relative to theunderlying economy. The contagion from banks to their sovereigns – coupled with growingconcerns about the sustainability of high-debt countries – paved the way for the second phase ofthe crisis: the sovereign debt crisis. The debt crisis was fuelled by the vicious loop betweenbanks and sovereigns. While the contingent liabilities associated with the weak state of thenational banks had undermined the credit standing of governments, the attendant loss of value ofthe bonds issued by these governments contributed to undermining the health of the banks evenfurther.Financial markets then began to fragment along national fault lines, eventually preventing entirebanking systems from accessing market funding. Lack of liquidity, coupled with the erosion ofcapital due to losses on sovereign exposures, precipitated a renewed credit crunch.A new round of the vicious cycle with negative feedback loops then began. The tightening indomestic credit conditions aggravated the ongoing recession, eroded the quality of banks’ loanportfolios and further weakened banks’ capital positions, which in turn made the bailing-out of thebanking system by the government even more likely and thus pushed up sovereign borrowingcosts even higher.Confronted with these events, many investors started to think that this negative spiral mightultimately lead the affected countries to exit the euro area. As a result, redenomination risksoared and sovereign spreads widened. 2 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
This led to a serious disruption of the monetary policy transmission mechanism and preventedour accommodative policy stance from reaching businesses and households. As the affectedeconomies represented a third of euro area GDP, the contagion became an acute threat to pricestability in the euro area.The ECB monetary policy response to these developments was twofold. First, to ensure thatbanks had access to longer-term funding, two three-year refinancing operations were undertakenat the end of 2011 and the beginning of 2012. Second, in summer 2012, the ECB’sannouncement of Outright Monetary Transactions served as a powerful circuit breaker of theongoing downward spiral. Nonetheless, the sovereign debt crisis left a damaging legacy, whichled the way for the third phase of the crisis.As the euro area entered a prolonged slump, banks in many parts of the euro area – particularlyin vulnerable countries – embarked on a drawn-out process of deleveraging, which mainlyinvolved reducing lending to the real economy. Towards end-2013, loans to the private sectorwere falling by more than 2% per year and a credit crunch loomed. Moreover, by mid-2014, theeconomic recovery was losing momentum and the weakness in aggregate demand was startingto depress inflation expectations. The sharp fall-off in oil prices that began in the late summer ofthat year exerted further disinflationary pressure.The Governing Council had to provide additional policy accommodation to restore price stability.But it faced the challenge that interest rates were already at low levels, limiting the room availablefor further cuts of its policy rates – the ECB deposit facility had already been brought down tozero in July 2012.But why were interest rates across the whole spectrum of maturities so low in the first place?Why was the buffer for further monetary policy easing so limited? One way to answer this is bytaking a longer-term perspective and disentangling nominal long-term interest rates into threeconstituent parts: (i) expected average inflation, (ii) expected average real rate over the lifespanof a bond, (iii) real term premia, representing the compensation investors require for holding ontoa long-term asset. Although data limitations make it hard to derive empirical estimates of eachelement of this decomposition going far back in the past, what transpires from this analysis isthat all components had had a decades-long history of consistent decline.Taking a historical perspective, long-term inflation expectations had declined steadily since thebeginning of the 1980s to stabilise at levels around 2% in the late 1990s. The trend decline andsubsequent stabilisation reflected the success of central banks’ monetary policy in regainingcontrol of inflation and in establishing strong credibility. However, in mid-2014 these benigndevelopments were overshadowed by a decline in long-term inflation expectations, which, from acentral bank’s perspective, was highly concerning. Turning to the real term premia, availablesince 2005 when inflation swaps were introduced in the euro area, we observe a significantdecline, mainly on account of the imbalance between the reduced supply of, and the increaseddemand for, safe assets at the global level, which has been exacerbated by the global financialcrisis.The final component is the expected average real rate. Focusing on its value over the longer run,it is found to have steadily declined due to structural forces on the one hand and to cyclicalfactors on the other. Structural factors include the slowdown in productivity, unfavourabledemographic developments and the increase in savings. The intuition is that these factors driveinvestment, which in turn determines the demand for loanable funds. In the euro area and othermajor advanced economies, productivity and population growth, which are also the drivers ofpotential GDP growth, have been declining for decades. The intersection point of the desireddemand for “loanable funds” with the level of savings constitutes the interest rate.In addition to these secular forces, more cyclical factors linked to the financial crisis have been a234 3 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
drag on real interest rates. In particular, the euro area has faced a massive debt overhang in thepublic and private sector, resulting in a severe “balance sheet recession” and a tightening ofcredit conditions. This has required a substantial amount of deleveraging, which in turn reducedinvestment, prolonged the downturn and weighed on the real interest rate.Overall, the pre-crisis slowdown in potential growth, coupled with the negative effects of thecrisis on investment and private sector balance sheets, has resulted in an imbalance betweensaving and investment, and largely accounts for the decline in the real interest rate to very lowlevels.From a monetary policy perspective, this means that the equilibrium real interest rate – definedas the value of the short-term real interest rate consistent with the economy operating at itspotential (or sustainable) level and inflation at its objective – has declined.Faced with disinflationary shocks, a central bank wishing to preserve price stability when theequilibrium real rate has declined has to steer interest rates to levels below the equilibrium realrate prevailing in the long run. Yet, while the equilibrium real rate can be very negative, there is alower bound to the nominal interest rate.In the context of the disinflationary pressures we faced in 2014 and 2015, this implied that theroom for the additional reduction of short-term interest rates was insufficient to generate thenecessary stimulus, given the low level of the equilibrium rate.To address this challenge, the ECB sought to affect the whole range of interest rates that arerelevant for private sector financing conditions. This strategy constitutes of three elements.The first was the launch of a negative interest rate policy, which entailed a decrease in thedeposit facility rate to –0.1% in June 2014 and to –0.2% in September 2014. This first wave ofcuts into negative territory provided additional stimulus as it extended the scope of conventionalmonetary policy. The deposit facility rate was subsequently brought to –0.4% in two further ratereductions in December 2015 and March 2016.The second was the introduction of a credit easing package, which included a third covered bondpurchase programme and an asset-backed securities purchase programme. This aimed toimprove the pass-through for each euro of liquidity injected into the financial system to privatesector borrowing costs and to reinforce the accommodative monetary policy stance. Thepackage also contained targeted longer-term refinancing operations, which were specificallydesigned to support bank lending to the private sector.The third element of the strategy was the addition of a public sector purchase programme to theECB’s asset purchase programme (APP). These measures helped to compress the risk premiaall along the yield curve. Shortly after the public sector purchase programme was launched, theGoverning Council embarked on a second wave of cuts to the deposit facility rate, whichempowered the portfolio rebalancing channel of the APP as it incentivised banks to invest centralbank reserves in higher yielding assets.These instruments were complemented by the use of forward guidance, through which westarted to communicate our expectations of future policy, along with the conditions that wouldwarrant a change in the policy stance.The economic impact of monetary policy measuresOur monetary policy strategy has borne fruit, with 2017 marking the euro area’s fifth consecutiveyear of positive growth. Recently, the pace of economic growth has moderated somewhat, whichin part relates to temporary factors and possibly some pull-back from last year’s strong growth.In addition, concerns about trade protectionism may have dampened business sentiment and5 4 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
expectations. The recent slowdown could also be a sign that supply-side constraints arebecoming increasingly binding. Nonetheless, the underlying strength of the euro area economypersists, with growth above potential and sentiment indicators still well above long-term averagesfor most sectors and countries.The underlying momentum is evidenced in the labour market, with around 8 million more peopleemployed in the euro area since the trough in mid-2013. This implies that all of the job lossesrecorded during the crisis have been recovered. Also, the unemployment rate is at its lowestlevel for nearly nine years, despite an increase in the labour force of more than 2%.In terms of demand components, private consumption – one of the main drivers of the euro arearecovery since 2013 – is being supported by the steady growth in households’ disposableincome, higher asset valuations and by an accommodative monetary policy that contributed to alower debt burden for borrowers. There also appears to be scope for further private consumptiongrowth as anticipated improvements in the labour market should keep consumer confidencehigh.At the same time, the investment outlook continues to strengthen and is supported by an ongoingneed to modernise the capital stock after years of subdued investment, as well as by veryfavourable financing conditions, an improvement in profitability and solid demand. The EuropeanCommission’s biannual investment survey, released on 27 April, shows expectations of a strongincrease in real industrial investment of 7% in 2018.An important factor supporting the good domestic demand performance is the favourablefinancing conditions for firms and households, which are still influenced by the policy measuresthat have been announced since June 2014. Bank lending rates to euro area non-financialcorporations (NFCs) have fallen by around 120 basis points since June 2014 and to householdsby around 110 basis points. At the same time, the heterogeneity of lending rates acrosscountries has also fallen sharply, with the pass-through of our measures becoming more even.Loans to NFCs have continued to grow and reached an annual growth rate of 3.3% in April 2017.The key question for monetary policy is: will growth remain sufficiently strong for the ongoingpressure on resource utilisation to continue to nudge inflation along a pathway that rises fastenough towards our objective?The main intersection between growth and inflation formation is the labour market. A look at thesectoral make-up of the most recent developments in the job market is encouraging. PMI surveyindicators signal continued employment creation ahead across sectors as well as across majorcountries in the euro area. Measures of labour market tightness, such as the vacancies-to-unemployment ratio or survey indicators of labour shortages, show an upward trend for the euroarea that has steepened over the past year. Measures of slack, such as the U6 measure ofunemployment, also show improvement.At the same time, there is growing evidence that labour market tightness is translating into astronger pick-up in wage growth. Annual growth in negotiated wages in the euro area increasedto 1.9% in the first quarter of 2018, from 1.6% in the fourth quarter of 2017. The upsurge wasprimarily due to Germany, where negotiated wages increased by 2.3% in first quarter of 2018 upfrom 1.9% in the fourth quarter of 2017, driven by major wage agreements in the German metaland engineering industry, the public sector and the construction sector.Rising wage pressures are gradually starting to be reflected in aggregate measures ofcompensation per employee. These, in turn, feed into producer prices for domestic sales of non-food consumer goods.The Governing Council has three criteria for assessing whether there is a sustained adjustmentin the path of inflation towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term: first, the6 5 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
convergence of the projected headline inflation to our medium-term aim; second, confidence inthe realisation of this convergence path; and third, the resilience of inflation convergence evenafter the end of our net asset purchases.Signals showing the convergence of inflation towards our aim have been improving, and both theunderlying strength in the euro area economy and the fact that such strength is increasinglyaffecting wage formation supports our confidence that inflation will reach a level of below, butclose to, 2% over the medium term. As for our third criterion, resilience, waning marketexpectations of sizeable further expansions of our programme have been accompanied byinflation expectations that are increasingly consistent with our aim.At the end, any decision concerning the termination or further extension of our net purchases willhinge on the ultimate judgement of the Governing Council. Once the Governing Council judgesthat the three criteria have been met, net asset purchases will expire, in line with our guidance.From that point in time, inflation developments will remain conditional on reinvestmentscontinuing for an extended period of time and on policy rates remaining at their present levelswell past the end of our net asset purchases. Our forward guidance on policy rates will then haveto be further specified and calibrated as appropriate for inflation to remain on the sustainedadjustment path to levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The stock of long-duration assets held in our portfolio will continue to put downward pressure on longer-terminterest rates well beyond the end of our net purchases.ConclusionLow interest rates fundamentally reflect the consequences of unfavourable secular trends,combined with the fall-out from the global financial crisis and euro area sovereign debt crisis. Asa result, the equilibrium real interest rate has declined to very low levels, although the preciselevel is very uncertain.Confronted with a declining equilibrium interest rate and the effective lower bound on policy rates,we had to resort to unconventional monetary policy measures in order to provide the necessaryaccommodation to support domestic demand, thwart the deflationary risks which were emergingin 2014 and prepare the way for inflation to return to our objective.However, monetary policy cannot increase the long-term real interest rate. This requires policiesthat address the factors depressing the real interest rate: increasing potential growth andcompleting the euro area’s institutional set-up. Such measures would support investment andrebalance saving and investment, which in turn would increase the equilibrium real interest rateand support the normalisation of interest rates.I would like to thank John Hutchinson for his support in preparing this speech.Expected inflation can be further decomposed into “risk neutral” inflation expectations and inflation risk premia.For the United States such analysis can be undertaken from the late 1990s when Treasury Inflation-ProtectedSecurities became available, while inflation swaps started being traded quite a bit later. See, for example,Abrahams, M., Adrian, T., Crump, R. K., Moench, E. and Yu, R., (2016), “Decomposing real and nominal yieldcurves”, Journal of Monetary Economics, Volume 84, December, pp. 182–200. In the euro area, thesedecompositions can also be undertaken using model-based analysis, albeit only over a shorter time period dueto the later availability of suitable inflation-linked instruments.Whereas the inflation risk premia and the real term premia, taken together, display a trend decline over recentdecades, the analysis of their individual dynamics is subject to data limitations as estimates are based oninflation-linked bonds or swaps which have only recently become more widespread. But it is likely that theinflation risk premia declined significantly in the 1980s and 1990s alongside the decline in inflationexpectations, with investors accepting lower compensation for bearing inflation risk. The decline in inflation riskpremia from mid-2014, by contrast, pointed to the increased prominence that market participants assigned to1234 6 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
lower than expected inflation outcomes around that time.More than a century ago Knut Wicksell (1898) described the natural rate as: “There is a certain rate of interest onloans which is neutral in respect to commodity prices, and tends neither to raise or to lower them. This isnecessarily the same as the rate of interest which would be determined by supply and demand if no use weremade of money and all lending were effected in the form of capital goods”.The “U6 measure” captures unemployment, underemployment (i.e. workers who would like to work more hours)and marginal attachment, which refers to those members of the workforce who are not seeking employmentvery actively, because, for example, they are not available to start a new job at short notice or have beendiscouraged by a fruitless search for work.56 7 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
Jessica Chew Cheng Lian: IFRS 17 Insurance ContractsWelcome address by Ms Jessica Chew Cheng Lian, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank ofMalaysia (Bank Negara Malaysia), at the Joint IFRS Foundation &amp; MASB RegionalWorkshop “IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts”, Kuala Lumpur, 17 May 2018.*   *   *Good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to today’s Regional Workshop on IFRS 17Standards for Insurance Contracts, jointly organised by the IFRS Foundation and the MalaysianAccounting Standards Board (MASB).Allow me first of all to congratulate the IFRS Foundation and MASB for putting this workshoptogether, with an impressive line-up of experts and practitioners to share their knowledge andinsights on IFRS 17. We are especially privileged to have with us today two senior members ofthe IASB Board Mr. Darrel Scott and Mr. Amaro Gomez, both of whom have been with the IASBfor more than 10 years. The strong interest in IFRS 17 and its importance both to financialsystems and businesses are clear from the turnout today, with more than 250 participants fromover 15 countries, representing industry players, accounting firms, national standard settingbodies and financial regulators.It is an honour for me to offer some brief remarks this morning to kick off today’s workshop. Onmy way here, I recalled a joke in which a lady was once told by her doctor that she would onlyhave six months to live. Understandably very distraught, she asks the doctor for advice on whatshe should do. The doctor suggested that she should marry a CPA. “Will that make me livelonger?” the lady asks hopefully. “No,” the doctor replies. “But it will seem longer”.Well, I promise to keep my remarks short, although since this is an accounting workshop, youwill forgive me if they might seem long.As you know, IFRS 17 was finalised and issued in 2017. Today, the 17th of May, also marks 17years since the International Accounting Standards Board took on the job to develop a globallyaccepted accounting standard for insurance contracts. What a remarkable coincidence indeed!The final IFRS 17 standards represent a historic milestone – for the first time, insurers in over120 countries, with assets worth at least USD13 trillion, will be reporting financial statementsbased on a common set of standards when IFRS 17 comes into effect in January 2021.Almost two decades ago, standard setters embarked on a Herculean mission to develop aglobally accepted accounting standard for the measurement of insurance contracts which did notexist before. In the time that it took to finalise IFRS 17, we have witnessed significantdevelopments in the accounting world, including the transformation of the InternationalAccounting Standards Committee (IASC) into today’s IASB, the formation of the Monitoring Boardto enhance public accountability of the IFRS Foundation, and sweeping reforms to keyaccounting standards to address the deficiencies which were believed to have amplified the 2008global financial crisis. The development of IFRS 17 itself saw the issuance of IFRS 4 as an interim standard, onediscussion paper and two exposure drafts. Its finalisation was achieved after more than 900meetings, 600 comment letters and 4 rounds of fieldwork and testing!  I am told it is among thelongest in duration, largest in scale and most complex project ever undertaken by an internationalstandard setter – making it a tremendous feat and a testament to the intellectual capacity andperseverance exemplified by the IASB.  1 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
Even then, this 17 year journey remains incomplete as the final stretch begins with the passing ofthe baton from the standard setter to those involved in preparations for implementation – that isthe industry. As the clock counts down to the global implementation date in January 2021, themost important implications of IFRS 17 lie ahead of us. 1. First, it will have an important impact in strengthening market discipline.2. Second, it will improve alignment between business units and financial management andreporting.  This in turn will provide more robust foundations for the growth and developmentof the insurance sector in this region.3. And third, it will raise important issues around governance to ensure the integrity of financialreporting by insurers and other market participants. Strengthening market disciplineFor a long period, the absence of a common uniting standard to account for the measurement ofinsurance contracts has resulted in a wide range of approaches being applied by insurers acrossthe world. Take for example the measurement of present value of future cashflows frominsurance contracts. While some insurers update the discount rates to reflect current economicconditions, others opt to retain the use of historical discount rates when these contracts wereoriginally underwritten, ignoring recent and future developments that could affect the value of thecontracts. This means that similar contracts are being measured very differently, resulting incontrasting representations of the true performance and strength of an insurer. Such variations inmeasurement approaches significantly complicate comparability between insurers.  This in turnweakens market discipline.The harmonisation of insurance contract measurement approaches across the globe broughtabout by IFRS 17 is therefore timely, if not long overdue.The measurement of insurance liabilities using current market prices will bring about a closeralignment between the assets and liabilities on an insurer’s balance sheet. And with a clearerdemarcation between underwriting and investment profits and the recognition of profits over thelifetime of a contract rather than at a single point in time, IFRS 17 will also paint a more accuratepicture of an insurer’s performance.These improvements will increase the relevance and utility of financial information provided toinvestors, financial advisers, insurance risk managers, businesses and individuals to informinvestment and purchasing decisions. As a result, markets should work better to reward prudentand profitable performance, and appropriately penalise risky and poor performance. This ispositive both for financial stability and the efficient allocation of economic resources. Improving alignment between business units and financial managementBank Negara Malaysia also expects IFRS 17 to be a key catalyst for insurers to review, if notoverhaul, business processes across the organisation. This will be driven by at least threefactors.First, the need for business units to capture broader and more granular information required forfinancial reporting. Second, changes in the way performance is measured under the newstandard. And third, increased opportunities for institutions to differentiate themselves from thecompetition, helped by a more integrated view of performance. These considerations will havewide implications for insurers’ organisation structures, data capture, infrastructure and systems, 2 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
risk management, and product design and development.At present, many insurers are operating on multiple, fragmented legacy systems – includinglargely separate systems supporting the finance, investment and actuarial functions.  Systemsfor regulatory reporting and compliance are also often separate in a number of institutions. Asinsurers begin to prepare for the reporting of insurance liabilities under the new regime, IFRS 17will create both a need and the opportunity for insurers to strategically re-think information flowsacross the organisation – not only to improve efficiencies in financial reporting and mitigateoperational risks, but also to capture synergies that will improve business and complianceoutcomes. This includes leveraging on data analytics to support more refined pricing, elevateinvestment and treasury operations, and achieve greater capital efficiency. Risks will also shift into sharper focus. As IASB chairman Hans Hoogervorst puts it, “properaccounting shines light on risks that might otherwise go unnoticed”. The financial reportingchanges brought about by IFRS 17 will support profitability analyses at the level of individualbusiness units and products, thereby increasing the visibility of risks and performanceassociated with specific business strategies and operational models.  Governance considerationsIFRS 17 will also have important implications for governance. One of the most problematic issues with the adoption of IFRS has been around the moreextensive use of management judgement and discretion in financial reporting. For example, inthe context of IFRS 17, calculating the contractual service margin component, an insurer’schoice of assumptions can have a significant impact on its forecast of future profits. While this isconsistent with the view that financial reporting should reflect management decisions, the scopefor abuse is also higher. This has also been a particular concern for regulators, resulting in dualreporting standards for general purpose and regulatory compliance which continue to bemaintained in some jurisdictions today. Such concerns are not entirely unfounded. Past studies have suggested that strong associationsexist between accounting discretion and opportunistic behaviour by firm managers wheregovernance is weak. In other words, in the absence of strong governance, managers havestrong incentives to exploit accounting latitude in order to achieve certain short-run performancegoals that are linked to rewards.This raises a number of important issues for governance. For one, insurers will need to considerthe adequacy of existing internal controls and accountability frameworks to ensure the integrity offinancial reporting. For example, where actuarial models are used, to what extent are thesemodels and the assumptions underpinning them subject to sufficiently robust validations?Insurers will also need to consider the depth of knowledge and expertise required at the auditcommittee level to enable the effective oversight and monitoring of management discretion. Partof this oversight includes the rigor applied by boards and audit committees in the appointment ofexternal auditors to ensure their ability to act as an independent check on managementdiscretion.It is also essential for insurers to develop strategies for improving communications with users offinancial statements. A key risk will be that users fail to make sense of reported results whichcan lead to irrational behavior and unintended consequences. Equipping board members andsenior management to communicate results effectively will be particularly important. These are also the issues that supervisors will be concerned with. Given the potential forheightened risks and uncertainty, the Bank will examine the need for regulatory prescriptions or 3 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
guidance – particularly in the early phases of implementation. Over time, we expect strongergovernance within insurers to reinforce associations between financial reporting and fundamentaleconomic factors, as intended by IFRS.  In Malaysia, the finalisation of IFRS 17 is indeed timely in the light of current reforms beingundertaken by Bank Negara Malaysia to further develop the domestic insurance market. This willsee greater competition and complexity in the insurance sector, alongside a renewed impetus forgrowth through channel diversification and digitalisation. In this environment, the implementationof IFRS 17 will have an important role in improving the quality of information provided to themarket on how these developments impact the performance of insurers, and in strengtheningfoundations for sound governance and risk management. This in turn will promote the effectivefunctioning of insurance markets to serve the economy.   Early preparation is keySo then, where do we stand today? With less than two and a half years before theimplementation date sets in, how prepared are insurers to implement IFRS 17?The answer is not encouraging. A recent survey published in January this year by a software firmcovering some 240 insurance companies spread around the world, found that a startling 92% ofinsurers had yet to start putting solutions in place. Among those that have started, a vast majorityare still only in the initial stages of planning.While there is still some time before the first reporting period under IFRS 17, it would be a gravemistake to leave things too late given the scope and enormity of the issues that that need to beaddressed. This is compounded by the prospect that insurers that are late to the game are likelyto face an acute skills shortage as first movers draw down a limited pool of qualified actuaries, ITspecialists, software and systems vendors and technical consultants. In Malaysia, early steps have been taken by Bank Negara to engage the industry on thedevelopment of broad implementation plans. That said, the granularity of the plans andimplementation progress remains uneven across insurers and takaful operators.Recognising the complexity and wide-ranging implications of the new standards, several industrytechnical working groups have been established in coordination with the Actuarial Society ofMalaysia to examine key issues and provide recommendations on the implementation of IFRS17. We have also conducted a first preliminary round of quantitative testing, which was intendedto help insurance companies gauge the potential impact of the new standards on theirresources, systems and reported performance. A second, more comprehensive quantitativetesting exercise has also been planned for the third quarter of this year. Going forward, the Bankwill be intensifying our monitoring and engagements with insurers and takaful operators on theirpreparations in the run up to 2021. ConclusionLooking ahead, a more optimistic outlook for the global economy will support favourableconditions for a smooth transition to IFRS 17. But the work must start now, and it must start rightby taking a broader and integrated approach to implementation. Today’s workshop aims to bringsome of the most important issues in implementation to light, and provide you with valuableinsights from our distinguished speakers and subject matter experts. With greater clarity andknowledge to inform careful preparations, insurers can be confident of not just achieving asmooth transition to IFRS 17, but of laying strong foundations for long term growth and success. 4 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches

Nestor A Espenilla, Jr: Investing in sound policies towardssustainable growthSpeech by Mr Nestor A Espenilla, Jr, Governor of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP, the centralbank of the Philippines), at the 2018 Economic Briefing of the American Chamber of Commerceof the Philippines, Inc. (AMCHAM), Manila, 24 April 2018.*   *   *Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon! I thank the officers and members of the AmericanChamber of Commerce of the Philippines (AMCHAM) for the invitation to speak today. Mymessage has two parts. First, I will give an update on the economy and its prospects over themedium term.  Second, I will talk about the government’s policy directions, focusing on the BSP’sinitiatives to sustain the growth momentum and make the Philippines a preferred option forbusiness and investment.Let me pose a question you may have asked yourselves at some point: Is now a good time toinvest in the Philippines?Conventional wisdom tells us that investing requires right timing. If you get it wrong, you may failto maximize the return on your resources, or you could be staring at significant losses.Given the rational desire to avoid loss and reduce risk, it is easy to fall into the trap of being overlycautious and missing out on profitable opportunities. Indecision and unnecessary waiting canalso be costly.Investing will always carry some degree of risk, and we can never fully anticipate how surprisescan disrupt or influence the market. The key is to not make decisions blindly. Indeed, informationon potential risks and returns, as well as knowledge gained from prior experience, can besources of confidence for any prudent investor.So, is now a good time to invest? Do we have information to make the right call?  The balance ofinformation that we have suggests that it is indeed an opportune time.Betting on the PhilippinesWe at the BSP remain optimistic about the Philippine economy’s prospects, especially aseconomic activity continues to gain traction across the globe. According to the latest figuresreleased by the IMF, global GDP growth reached 3.8 percent in 2017, the fastest pace since2011 as investment and trade continued to pick up. The IMF now forecasts the global economyto grow by about 3.9 percent in 2018 and 2019, as accommodative policies support the strongergrowth impulses in advanced and emerging economies alike.However, we continue to monitor developments that could dampen this growth momentum. These include increased trade protectionism, rising geopolitical tensions, and the possibility ofheightened financial stresses owing to the onset of monetary policy tightening in a number ofeconomies especially in the U.S. Even with these downside risks, we remain confident about our own prospects. The Philippineeconomy is coming off another banner year. Real GDP expanded by 6.7 percent in 2017.  This isthe sixth consecutive year that the economy had grown by over 6.0 percent.The IMF also shares our optimism, as it forecasts the Philippine economy to expand by about 6.7percent in 2018 and 6.8 percent in 2019.  This is not far from the National Government’s target of7.0-8.0 percent growth over the next three years. All these paint the Philippines as one of themore dynamic and fastest-growing economies in Asia. 1 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
We have also observed that growth has become more broad-based over the years. Along withthe services sector, manufacturing and construction have emerged as potent drivers of output.On the demand side, increased capital investments and public spending, especially since thepast year, have complemented robust private consumption in stimulating economic activity.Meanwhile, amid rapid economic growth, the inflation environment has remained manageable.Except for 2015 and 2016 when the decline in international oil prices tempered inflationarypressures, inflation has settled within the announced target ranges since 2009. Thus far in 2018,headline inflation has averaged 3.8 percent (using the new 2012 Consumer Price Index series). For 2018, our latest forecast estimates average inflation at 3.9 percent. This is near the high endof our target range of 2-4 percent for 2018-2019.  So this bears careful watching.  Nevertheless,we see inflation moderating and reverting to around 3 percent by 2019, the midpoint of the targetrange.We expect the confluence of strong growth and stable inflation being sustained over the mediumterm.  Specifically, as the National Government pours in more investments into physicalinfrastructure and increases expenditure in soft investments in our young population to providethem with higher quality education, skills development and better health services, the economy’sproductive capacity will improve further.  These will help boost productivity and we can expectfurther accelerated growth in potential output.Meanwhile, various safety net programs to mitigate the impact of recent tax reform measures,especially on the vulnerable sectors of society, should also help moderate inflationary pressuresin the immediate term.We also believe that these public investments in physical infrastructure and human capital aresustainable because they are supported by prudent fiscal management. The first wave of taxreforms under the TRAIN Law, in particular, should help generate additional revenues to financethe Government’s programs. Reforms to encourage tax compliance, improve revenuecollections, and plug regulatory loopholes, among others, are also in the pipeline to furtherstrengthen the country’s fiscal position.At the same time, the country’s healthy financial system has also continued to fuel the growthmomentum, as domestic liquidity remains ample to satisfy the requirements of our growingeconomy, including the solid demand for loans across key economic sectors. Amid the robustexpansion in credit, financial institutions have enhanced their liquidity and risk managementpractices to prevent buildup of systemic risks, as reflected in their improved asset quality, firmliquidity position, and strong capitalization.The rise in investments and increase in infrastructure spending have been accompanied bystronger demand for imports.  This is expected.  Over time, these investments will bear fruit inthe form of better infrastructure and improved domestic competitiveness.  This will support highand sustainable economic growth.Moreover, despite posting an overall balance of payments (BOP) deficit of US$863 million in2017, the country’s external position continues to be manageable with the deficit at less than 1%of GDP.  Rising inflows of foreign direct investments as well as sustained overseas Filipinoremittances and BPO receipts provide resilience against external shocks. Moreover, the ongoingglobal economic recovery bodes well for our merchandise exports.  Meanwhile, the movement ofthe peso remains market-driven.  This exchange rate flexibility will promote self-correctionmechanisms and avoid dangerous build-up of unsustainable imbalances.  These elementsshould all keep the balance of payments well under control. Finally, as a sturdy external liquidity buffer, we have built up gross internal reserves of over $80billion equivalent to nearly 8-months worth of imports of goods and services.  We likewise haveaccess to market financing because of our hard-earned solid investment grade rating.  We have 2 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
likewise developed secondary liquidity buffers from various regional safety net arrangements wehave worked out with our neighbors.To summarize, the Philippines continues to be a good bet for investing because of soundmacroeconomic fundamentals. Factors in its favor are its broad-based growth, within-targetinflation, prudent fiscal management, sound financial system, and manageable externalpayments position.These strengths did not materialize overnight. These are well-earned dividends of our soundcommitment to timely policy actions and to necessary and bold structural reforms over theyears.With this in mind, it is easy to see good policymaking as akin to investing in the country’s well-being. As with any investment decision, getting the timing right requires mindfulness, vigilance,and flexibility, as economic conditions could shift at a moment’s notice. Prudence also requirespolicies to be grounded on a reasonable assessment of pertinent information on potential costs,benefits, and tradeoffs.Clouds on the horizonNevertheless, in spite of a generally favorable economic climate, there are a few clouds on thehorizon that require us to be especially vigilant. There are two particularly key developments thatcould challenge the country’s position of relative strength.  We intend to address these withtimely and well-informed policy responses.One revolves around dealing with inflation and potential overheating.  At our most recentassessment of the monetary policy stance last March, we determined that our prevailingmonetary policy settings continued to be appropriate. Inflation has been evolving in line with ourprojections, as the first-round price effects of the recent tax reforms appear to have been limited.We also considered that prospects for domestic economic activity continue to be firm and withineconomic potential that in itself is being bolstered by investments in both physical infrastructureand social capital. At the same time, the BSP has always been patient in analyzing data and calibrating scenarios inassessing the monetary policy stance. Our latest readings do show that the risks to inflationremain weighted toward the upside.  Our surveys indicate that inflation expectations have startedto rise.  These could contribute to potential second-round price effects. Nevertheless, non-monetary measures such as targeted subsidies are expected to mitigate these second roundinflationary pressures.    We shall see.  And we shall act accordingly.Today, the BSP has many options to maintain firm monetary control.  Since the adoption of theInterest Rate Corridor (IRC) system in 2016, we have gained sufficient flexibility to rely onauction-based instruments for liquidity management to complement our workhorse overnightreverse repurchase borrowings at our declared policy rate.  We can adjust monetary conditionsby adjusting auction volumes to move our market-determined term deposit facility (TDF) rates. This has effectively allowed us a channel to provide guidance to short-term market interestrates.  In recent months, we have seen a firm anchoring to the BSP’s interest rate corridor asmarket rates strongly trended upwards.  (Note:  For example, the 91 T-bill rate has increased bymore than 100bps since December 2017).Our active domestic open market operations interact in close coordination with our foreignexchange market operations, adjustments to reserve requirements, systemic macro-prudentialmeasures and risk-based supervision of individual banks.In sum, BSP actions remain timely and appropriate to dynamic market conditions.  Theseactions help regulate the economy and control inflation.  The signal will be continuously 3 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
reinforced by other BSP actions, as deemed necessary by developments.Looking ahead, the BSP remains watchful against signs of inflation becoming more broad-based.We stand firm on our intent to take immediate and appropriate measures to ensure that ourmonetary policy stance supports our price and financial stability objectives. The coming task ofthe Monetary Board is to carefully evaluate the appropriateness of a measured policy response tofirmly anchor inflation expectations in line with our forecast that inflation targets will continue to bemet in 2018-2019.  Toward this end, we also note that economic growth remains solid enough toabsorb some policy tightening, if warranted.The other issue pertains to keeping the financial system sound and stable amid constant shifts inthe economic landscape. In particular, we cannot ignore how so-called megatrends havechanged the way businesses operate. These megatrends have made policy making morecomplex.  These include demographic changes and the rise of disruptive technologies.To address these challenges, the BSP trains its sights on implementing game-changing financialsector reforms to allow the financial system to be more flexible, market-driven, and innovative.At this point, let me focus on some of the major reforms that we have already put in place.The effective implementation of the IRC has allowed us to initiate the gradual and phasedreduction of reserve requirements consistent with efficient absorption of any excess liquidity.  Webegan with a one percentage point cut effective in March this year. Subsequent reductions — inthe nature of liquidity-neutral operational adjustments — will be done with the proper pace,magnitude, and timing and will largely depend on the liquidity absorbing capacity of our openmarket operations.We would like to reiterate that as with the operational shift to the IRC system, the reduction inreserve requirements is not intended to materially affect the prevailing monetary policy settings.Think of it as the BSP shifting from one instrument of liquidity management to another, as liquidityreleased to the market by the cut in reserve ratio will be re-absorbed through offsettingadjustments in our open market operations, as informed by our updated and comprehensiveliquidity forecasts.Another vital pillar in our financial sector reform agenda is the acceleration of financial marketdevelopment and deepening. We have rolled out various initiatives to further develop the localcurrency debt and foreign exchange (FX) markets, including the launch of the GovernmentSecurities Repo Program in November 2017.As part of this coordinated government endeavor, the Bureau of the Treasury released theimplementing guidelines for the enhanced Government Securities Eligible Dealers (GSED)Program last February 2018.  Further, the SEC is set to issue its exposure draft of the rules onadministration of government securities benchmarks, consistent with recent global benchmarkreform initiatives and international standards for interest rate benchmark design.We have also undertaken various FX reforms towards a deeper and better organized FX market. This includes further liberalizing FX rules to reduce the cost of doing business and improve datacapture.  The latest initiative involved the removal of the prior approval requirement for privatesector foreign borrowings.  Instead, there is a post-transaction regulation requirement for theprimary purpose of capturing data.Over the medium term, we also plan to enhance FX market governance and oversight to improvetransparency and price discovery.  Ultimately, we want to see a more liquid FX market thatsupports a flexible and market-determined exchange rate. Finally, the BSP aims to foster an enabling ecosystem where competition and responsible 4 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
innovations in the financial sector are encouraged to thrive. We have strategically opened up thebanking system to encourage competition, particularly from new players and fintech companies.This is because we believe that leveraging on safe and innovative financial institutions can alsodrive business and industry growth, and likewise open  gateways to greater financial inclusion.We have also set our sights on the digitalization of the financial system.  We are working closelywith the industry in implementing the National Retail Payment System (NRPS) to establish asafe, reliable and affordable retail payments system, with an increase in the share of electronicpayments to at least 20% by 2020. Just yesterday, the BSP launched InstaPay, the latestautomated clearing house (ACH) under the NRPS, which allows for safe and affordable retailelectronic payments in real time. The BSP remains mindful of potential risks to financial stability and integrity, including thoseemanating from cyber-attacks, money laundering, and terrorism financing. We find that our “test-and-learn” approach remains useful as we continue to deal with increasing digital innovationsand more complex threats to the financial system.Final ThoughtsLadies and gentlemen, as I close, let us return to the question I posed at the beginning. Is now agood time to invest?A quick look at the current economic landscape certainly provides a compelling argument.Standing on a position of strength, the Philippines presents tremendous and worthwhileopportunities for business and investment.While there are clouds on the horizon, the BSP continues to be vigilant and invests in the craftingof sound policies and disciplined reforms to guarantee the continuity of our economic prosperityand to further strengthen our domestic sources of resilience.We will intensify our efforts to safeguard price stability as well as the health and stability of ourfinancial system. At the same time, we will continue to provide a conducive operatingenvironment for the financial sector to help fulfill its role as catalyst of economic growth.Thank you, and good afternoon. 5 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
Mojmír Hampl: Central bank independence in practice - the case ofthe Czech RepublicSpeaking points by Mr Mojmír Hampl, Vice Governor of the Czech National Bank, at the AnnualResearch Conference of the Central Bank of Ukraine, Kiev, 1 June 2018.*   *   *Ladies and Gentlemen,Before I begin my talk in earnest, I would like to thank the organizers for inviting me to thisinspiring event. It is an honor to participate in such a distinguished panel. And it is a particularpleasure for me to visit Kiev, one of the great historical pivots of Europe and also a city withimmense economic potential. The latter, I believe, can be said about Ukraine in general.The topic of this panel and the entire conference is monetary-fiscal interactions. This is animportant issue, and I am convinced that a good working relationship between the central bankand the government is imperative for the proper counter-cyclicality of economic policy. Myintention today, however, is to offer a related but cautionary tale. I will talk about central bankindependence, with an emphasis on the experience of my own country.Few economists nowadays doubt the importance of central bank independence for achievingprice stability. For example, the latest meta-analysis of this research question summarizes 300empirical estimates from dozens of studies and finds strong evidence that independence iscrucial for delivering low inflation (Iwasaki and Uegaki, 2017). This finding holds for bothdeveloped and emerging economies, as the authors clearly show.But many economists in this stream of literature, most prominently Alex Cukierman, stress that itis not enough to have independence enshrined in the central bank’s charter. Legal independenceis a necessary condition for actual independence, but not a sufficient one. I would say that actualindependence is a state of mind of central bankers. This state of mind, then, determines theoutcome of monetary policy and is imperative for providing price stability.So how can actual independence differ from legal independence? The key condition for actualindependence is the de facto impossibility to dismiss central bank board members. In fact, thecharters of almost all central banks around the world (including the National Bank of Ukraine andthe Czech National Bank) allow for board members to be dismissed under some very specificconditions. But the applicability of these conditions varies widely, depending on custom and –crucially, I believe – the central bank’s standing in society.This observation brings me to an important point I want to make. Even if a central bank is actuallyindependent from the government, it cannot over the long term act in direct contradiction to thepreferences of society. For example, if the population is not averse to modest inflation, thecentral bank will have a hard time imposing an ultra-low-inflation environment, with all theassociated costs and benefits, over the long run.The experience of the Czech National Bank, perhaps, serves as a case in point, although in theopposite direction. In general, Czechs despise inflation, and the central bank needs to explainrepeatedly why it uses the worldwide standard of a 2% inflation target instead of targeting literalstability of the CPI level, or 0% inflation. Already many decades before the era of independentmonetary policy, in the early 1920s, Czechoslovakia pursued a strategy of deliberatelystrengthening the national currency. This policy resulted in deep deflation, in strong contrast tothe hyperinflations seen at that time in neighboring countries (Austria, Germany, Hungary, andPoland; see Sargent, 1982).So, it comes as no surprise that the Czech National Bank is rarely applauded for cutting interest 1 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
rates, while hikes are often welcomed by a majority of the population. An important public-relations test arose for the Bank in 2013, when interest rate cuts proved insufficient to returninflation to the target. Inspired partly by one distinguished member of today’s panel, the CzechNational Bank adopted an exchange rate commitment to keep the currency from appreciating.The commitment was terminated a year ago. Since then, studies by the IMF and academics alikehave pointed to large benefits of the policy in terms of reducing unemployment, lifting GDPgrowth, and preventing deflation. Within two years after the commitment’s enactment, the CzechRepublic – at least in part thanks to the commitment – turned from a de facto sick man of Europeto one of the fastest-growing economies with the lowest unemployment rate in the entire EU.When I attend conferences and seminars at other central banks, my foreign colleagues oftenassume that such a policy must have been tremendously popular. Indeed, the economics behindit is straightforward, and the resulting boost to peoples’ wages is hard to deny. In spite of that, theexchange rate commitment caused the sharpest ever deterioration of public confidence in theCzech National Bank: from around 75% to around 50%. Confidence only recovered after thecommitment was terminated. These were precisely the times when its hard-won independencehad to be put to work.Thus, central bank independence built into the country’s law code is a treasure without whichprice stability is rarely possible. But equally important is the perception of independence bycentral bankers themselves. This perception, in turn, depends on the compatibility of themonetary policy regime with the preferences of the population. It is often overlooked, however,that central bankers have an impact on these preferences. Rhetoric matters a great deal, andcommunication is now one of the most potent tools of monetary and other policy.True, enhancing financial literacy and altering public preferences in the process is a thankless,tiresome, long-term job, one that is often only appreciated years or even decades later. The manresponsible for instilling a low-inflation mentality in Czechs, Alois Rašín, was shot dead in 1923by a young communist. At that time, Rašín’s policies were very unpopular among some groupsof the population. But nowadays his legacy underpins the thinking of Czechs about inflation, forbetter or worse, and through that, the stability of the Czech currency.Thank you for your attention.References:Ichiro Iwasaki & Akira Uegaki, 2017. “Central Bank Independence and Inflation in TransitionEconomies: A Comparative Meta-Analysis with Developed and Developing Economies,” EasternEuropean Economics vol. 55(3), pages 197–235.Thomas J.

Juyeol Lee: 68th anniversary of the Bank of KoreaSpeech by Mr Juyeol Lee, Governor of the Bank of Korea, at the commemorating ceremony ofthe Bank of Korea's 68th anniversary, Seoul, 12 June 2018.*   *   *Dear fellow members of the Bank of Korea family!Today is the 68th anniversary of the Bank of Korea’s establishment. Taking this opportunity, Iwish to express my sincere gratitude to our predecessors who devoted themselves to thedevelopment of the Bank of Korea and our economy, and to the many people who havesupported and encouraged the Bank. I would like to say in addition how much I appreciate theefforts of all members of our staff, who are faithfully fulfilling the duties entrusted to them in theirpositions.It is judged that the Korean economy is sustaining its solid growth, as consumption and exportscontinue their favorable movements even though construction and facilities investment are goingthrough adjustments. There are high uncertainties, due to the sluggish employment conditions aswell as the financial unrest seen in some emerging market countries, but going forward thedomestic economy is expected to grow at a pace that does not diverge greatly from the pathforecast in April.However, there are still several structural problems in our economy, which are limiting thevirtuous cycle between growth, employment, income and consumption. Sluggish employment isa result not only of the delayed improvements in business conditions in some industries, but ofstructural factors such as the dual labor market structure as well. Growth that depends heavilyon specific sectors such as capital- and technology-intensive industries can result in weakereconomic resilience to external shocks. Household debt that grows more rapidly than householdincome can limit consumption through increases in borrowers’ debt repayment burdens.I would like to emphasize once again that, when both the domestic and external economies aregrowing, structural reforms have to be carried out swiftly. During the structural reform processconflicts of interest among economic actors can of course arise. But if we postpone our effortsto resolve our economy’s structural vulnerabilities, then it is likely that we will face a much moresevere situation in the medium to long term. The government will have to smoothly mediate thedisputes among economic actors that can appear in the process of structural reform, and makeefforts to ensure that any resulting negative effects can be minimized.Fellow members of the Bank of Korea!I would like to talk now about some of the things that our Bank of Korea will have to focus oncarrying out from the second half of this year.As inflationary pressures on the demand side are still not high, while the domestic economy isexpected to continue its solid growth, we will need to maintain our accommodative monetarypolicy stance. In this process we will however have to consider the facts that the financialimbalances can grow, and, from a longer term perspective, that we need to increase ourmonetary policy operating capacity to respond to fluctuations in business cycles. From thisstandpoint, we will have to carefully judge whether it is necessary to adjust the accommodativemonetary policy stance further, while closely checking future economic growth and inflationtrends, changes in the monetary policies of major countries and the consequent financial stabilityconditions.In the second half of this year we will have to consider the inflation target to be applied from nextyear. The way in which the inflation target is set, and the method by which it is operated, have 1 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
direct effects on the central bank’s credibility and on whether economic actors’ inflationexpectations are securely anchored. We will have to closely analyze whether there have beenany structural changes in the underlying price flows, and in the relationship between growth andprices, and properly set the inflation target and the period for re-examining it. We will also have tolook whether there are any areas that need improvement in how we fulfill our responsibilities forexplaining policy.We will need to strengthen our efforts aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of our policycommunication. When uncertainties are high the markets can react sensitively to even smallchanges in economic conditions, or even to a single word from the policy authorities. It can thusbe said that a meticulous communication strategy is demanded, to ensure that consistentcommunication concerning our policy directions can be achieved.We will also have to devote special attention to financial stability. Financial and foreign exchangemarkets in some emerging markets with weak fundamental conditions have experienced uneaserecently. Given Korea’s favorable external soundness It is unlikely that the financial unrest inthese countries will spread to affect us. But if overseas risks, from the monetary policynormalizations in major countries and strengthening protectionism for example, materializesimultaneously we will be unable to accurately estimate their effects. We will therefore have towatch even more carefully any changes in these risks.We can also not afford to be negligent in our research on and our responses related to newissues in economics. We will need to strengthen our analyses of new forms of risk to financialstability and the changes in our monetary policy operating conditions that can occur due to digitalinnovations such as distributed ledger technology and Fintech. And given that considerablechanges in the relations between North Korea and South Korea are expected going forward, itwill be necessary as well to prepare in advance for the new role demanded of our central bank,on the basis of our research on the North Korean economy carried out so far.Fellow Bank of Korea staff!With regard to our internal management, I have said that over the next four years we will put anemphasis on ‘change and innovation,’ and improve our systems and customs. To put thispromise into practice, we gathered staff members’ opinions, among which of those that could beimmediately reflected have been put into practice after the necessary institutional arrangements.We delegated to lower levels authority in internal management related for example to humanresources affairs, and greatly simplified our reporting procedures. We will have to aspire todevise measures that would improve the matters now under consideration as well. I would like tostress again that the ultimate purpose of these internal management improvements is toheighten our organization’s efficiency and productivity.In view of the fact that the system can control people’s thinking and behavior, we will have topush unceasingly ahead with system improvements as well. However, if we want our systemimprovements to bear fruit, then our organizational culture and our staff members’ awarenesswill also have to change, along with the system. In particular, if the staff members at the seniorlevel firmly accept these changes, take the initiative and set examples for others, then there willbe tangible results.We will also have to devote redoubled efforts to managing the risks that can occur in the conductof our institution’s operations. If we do not properly manage our IT system, security and legalrisks, the Bank of Korea’s external reputation can be greatly damaged. Before any adverseincident occurs there is a tendency for small problems to gradually appear that provide us withforewarnings. And if such signs are sensed, even if they are only trivial, we should not justdismiss them but must investigate their causes and respond to them thoroughly.Fellow members of the Bank of Korea! 2 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
Recently our economy is continuing to grow at the level of its potential growth rate andmaintaining a favorable external credit standing, unlike some EMEs that are experiencingfinancial and economic unease. I think that you have contributed substantially to this end byfulfilling your duties. But we cannot stop here, and will have to seek change and innovation evenmore. Only by doing so can we avoid wavering even when confronted with new challenges, andcontribute to the continual development of our economy.Today, as we greet the 68th year since our Bank’s establishment, I would like to thank everyoneonce again for your hard work, and I wish each of you, together with your families, health andhappiness always.Thank you. 3 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
  1      “Hot Property: the housing market in major cities” Introduction speech by Klaas Knot at the DNB High-Level Seminar Amsterdam, 24 May   In his opening speech at the DNB housing market seminar, Klaas Knot shares his view on how housing prices can become a problem for broader economic wellbeing, and thus form an area of interest to central bankers. A more balanced and suitable supply of housing is needed. The new Dutch housing agenda is a promising example of the leading role our government should play on the Dutch housing market.   Distinguished guests,  Welcome to Amsterdam! The city with the highest house price rises in the Netherlands and, last year, also in the Eurozone.  I live here, so I have witnessed the soaring prices at first hand. Amsterdam, like many capital cities, has led the rebound in the Dutch housing market, which started in 2013. Prices here began to take off, and within a few years were growing at annual rates of over 15%. It is the same story in other large cities in the Netherlands. And more recently, the rest of the country has followed this trend, so house prices are rising everywhere. My work takes me all over the globe, to the world’s major cities. Many of you come from these cities, in Europe: London, Paris and Stockholm, but also Washington, Seoul and Sydney.  And similarly, I have seen with my own eyes similar housing market dynamics in these locations, as they are becoming increasingly popular. This is why we invited you all here, to discuss some serious questions. Do we agree on the analysis of the problems in this field? Could we learn from each other’s best practices? Is there one solution? My view But first, please allow me to share my view. As a resident, as the president and of course as an economist. While the increased popularity of cities worldwide may be good news for these places, and for homeowners, it also poses challenges. Demand for urban housing is strongly outstripping supply. This leads to the surge in housing prices that we are seeing. At the same time, it also puts pressure on rental markets.  And although supervisors, central banks and governments have strengthened mortgage regulation since the crisis, the risk of a credit-driven boom always looms. After all, homeowners are often willing to take on more debt to be able to live in the city. We haven’t yet seen a credit boom in the Netherlands, but in some other countries house price growth is coupled with strong mortgage growth.   
  2  Indeed, the strong price increases are making urban housing affordability a pressing issue everywhere in the world. For central bankers, responsible for financial stability, affordability may not always be their most important concern. However, extreme examples such as the San Francisco Bay Area, Silicon Valley, where the average house costs €1.5 million, show this can become a problem for broader economic wellbeing. As these areas are booming, many workers cannot afford to live there anymore. Recently, we see books, research papers and newspaper articles documenting these consequences of decreasing affordability, social as well as economic.   Urban demographics are changing as a result. Young, well-educated people are drawn to cities, often chasing a limited supply of housing. Due to the housing shortage, middle-income households are at a disadvantage: too rich to qualify for social housing, not rich enough to buy a house. They need to rely on the rental market. However, if this market does not function well, as is the case in many cities, middle income families are forced to move away.  Moreover, the rise of major cities also leads to increasing divergence between these cities and more peripheral regions. At the same time, spillover effects cause prices to rise in areas directly bordering major cities. This ultimately affects the structure of economic development, which increasingly shifts to urban areas and away from the periphery. Housing supply The lack of suitable housing plays a major role here. Supply shortages in cities, and to a lesser extent in other parts of the country, are a main driver of current price rises. And as we know from past experience, strong house price rises can lead to overshooting. Which is often followed by a correction. This price volatility does not remain confined to the housing market. In countries like the Netherlands, with a high rate of home ownership and dependence on mortgage lending, house price volatility feeds into the real economy. The link between house prices and private consumption is very strong here.  This symbiotic relationship causes booms to grow larger and busts to be deeper. A more balanced and suitable supply of housing is thus needed. This does not only mean owner-occupied housing, but also private rental, especially for middle-income households. As a DNB study pinpointed last year, they are put in a tight spot on the housing market. In our view, a larger mid-market private rental segment is the key to creating a housing market that is free of such imbalances, especially in cities.  On top of that, it will make the housing market better aligned to the needs of the increasingly flexible and globalized labour market.  However, since last year, the necessary progress on enlarging housing supply is still limited. A lack of planning and building capacity, as well as zoning restrictions, are impeding new-build developments in and around cities. Moreover, lower-tier governments like municipalities lack effective incentives to develop the private rental sector.  So it is up to the Dutch government to take a more pro-active, leading role in ensuring an appropriate supply of new houses. They have the means to encourage municipalities to provide more private rental housing, for instance by setting minimum targets. In practice, this would mean that the government makes arrangements with municipalities about including a minimum percentage of mid-market rental housing in zoning plans. Moreover, as a higher-level body, the national government can coordinate between localities and is less affected by local pressures, such as NIMBY (Not-In-My-Backyard) protests.  Therefore, I was very happy to hear, yesterday, the Minister of the Interior presenting a new housing agenda. This agenda is meant as an accelerator to ensure the construction of 75,000 new houses each year until 2025. I think this is good initiative, all the more because a broad spectrum of housing market stakeholders is involved: builders, housing associations, home-owners, institutional investors and local governments. To me, this is a promising example of the leading role our government should play on the Dutch housing market. Our next speaker, whom I will introduce shortly, will speak more about the Dutch government’s efforts in this field.  
  3  As a central banker with a financial stability mandate, these housing market developments pose new challenges for risk analysis and possible policy responses. And I am sure you are all struggling with these challenges too.  Today’s and tomorrow’s seminar You are now all here in this room to discuss these issues under the watchful eye of our past presidents. And as you might have noticed from the programme, not only do you come from different countries, but also from divergent backgrounds. When organising this seminar, we wanted to avoid groupthink and promote a healthy exchange of views from different perspectives. So some speakers come from central banks and public bodies, others from academia or the private sector. And of course a seminar about major cities would not be complete without representatives from cities themselves.  We hope your different backgrounds help us tackle the questions that are facing us. Today and tomorrow, we would like to address four of these questions. We start with the question of why big cities are so popular, and whether this popularity is here to stay. The first session will be devoted to this question. But I am also sure our keynote speaker professor Edward Glaeser will shine more light on this issue. After all, he has been conducting research on urban development for over 25 years. Being at a central bank, we will also broach the bubble question: is there a housing bubble in the big cities and how do you measure this? If there is anything the financial crisis has taught us, it is that there is most cause for concern when this bubble is fuelled by excessive credit provision. Credit-driven bubbles are most detrimental to financial stability. Curiously, in the Netherlands, the housing market recovery does not seem to be credit-driven: house prices seem to be exploding, but mortgage growth is near zero. I cannot help but notice that this uncommon development is driven by today’s low interest rates. As private investors do not find sufficient return in savings accounts or other safe investments, they turn to the housing market which drives up prices. Tomorrow, we will then look at the third question, on the supply side of the housing market: what role do supply frictions play in the current environment? Cities are notoriously dense, and expanding supply is thus difficult in urban areas. So more than in peripheral areas, supply issues and policy options should be studied in detail. This brings us to the last topic, our fourth question: which policy actions are needed to effectively address these issues? Until recently, policymakers, at least at central banks, focused mainly on restricting demand. Measures like LTV limits, LTI restrictions and capital requirements should keep mortgage growth, and thus price growth, in check. However, current developments seem less driven by credit, at least in the Netherlands, and more by fundamentals like population growth and supply shortages. It’s thus likely we need to look further than our standard housing market toolkit. The seminar: proceedings & logistics To ensure the lessons learned today and tomorrow are available for the future, we will publish a conference proceedings after the summer. From the contributions we have already received, I can tell that this will be a rich collection of papers that will surely add to collective knowledge on urban housing markets.  Before I introduce the next speaker, I would like to give you a few details on the logistics of the seminar. To begin with, each session has a different moderator. They have an important role today: to make sure presentations are kept brief and to-the-point, and to stimulate debate. Second, we are fortunate to have an impressive turnout of high-level policy makers, leading academics and financial sector representatives from various countries. Given the seating constraints, a number have to sit in the second row. At the same time, let me stress that everyone in the second row is just as welcome to participate in the discussion as those seated at the front.  Finally, please note that we’ve invited a couple of our trusted friends from the Dutch press to attend this seminar. But, obviously, the Chatham House Rule applies, starting right after this introduction and the key note speech. So, nothing stands in the way of an open, thought-provoking and stimulating discussion! I sincerely hope that today’s seminar will bring our collective understanding of urban housing markets a bit further, and help us tackle the challenges ahead.  
  4  And let me now turn to our next speaker. We had invited our Deputy Prime Minister, and Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations, Kajsa Ollongren. She is responsible for housing policy in the Netherlands. Unfortunately, and perhaps ironically, she has been called to The Hague for a parliamentary debate on the affordability of Dutch housing. In her stead, Erik-Jan van Kempen will deliver the opening remarks. Erik-Jan is Program Director General at the Ministry, responsible for implementing the Environmental and Planning Act. Moreover, as an inhabitant of Amsterdam, he is very familiar with the situation in the capital.  He will now enlighten us with his view on these matters. Erik-Jan, the floor is yours. 
            I am grateful to Alice Carr, Ankita Mehta and Tim Taylor for their assistance in preparing these remarks.

     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 2  2   Thank you Peter (Grauer) for that introduction and for hosting the inaugural Markets Forum. This incredible Fosters + Partners building connects the Roman Temple of Mithras in its foundations to the glories of St. Paul’s in its vista, while pushing the boundaries of sustainable office design. It is a node in a global network that spins data, information, and capital instantaneously across the planet. We have been reminded in recent years that networks have the power to divide, as well as connect.  And we are here today to continue the process of reconnecting financial markets to the real economy. Three years ago, in the wake of a series of scandals ranging from mis-selling to manipulation, and following a period when markets had become ever more connected to each other but disconnected from those they serve, the Bank of England, the Financial Conduct Authority and HM Treasury published the recommendations of the Fair and Effective Markets Review (FEMR).1 FEMR was ground-breaking and ambitious in its recommendations to restore trust in the markets on which we all depend. At today’s event, policymakers and market participants will take stock of the progress in building fair and effective markets.  And we will consider how to maintain focus as memories fade and the temptation to turn inwards returns. We are doing so because we know that everyone has a shared interest in real markets.   Real markets are professional and open.  They are resilient, fair and effective, and they maintain their social license. Real markets are not ends in themselves but serve the interests of end-users. Real markets don’t just happen.  They depend on private actors and public initiatives to ensure the quality of market infrastructure. That includes ‘hard’ infrastructure, the plumbing of markets that determines the mechanics of markets; and ‘soft’ infrastructure, like standards and codes that define how market participants should behave. Since the crisis, the UK has played a leading role in addressing misconduct in domestic and global markets.                                                       1 See Fair and Effective Markets Review Final Report, HM Treasury, Bank of England and FCA (June 2015).

     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 3  3   We know that the City has a particular responsibility given London’s position as the pre-eminent global financial centre.2 What has been achieved? So what has been done to re-build the necessary market infrastructures for real markets to thrive?3 In the UK, laws and regulations have been strengthened by, for example, introducing a criminal regime for manipulating benchmarks. Public authorities know they cannot and should not try to legislate for every circumstance, monitor every transaction, or anticipate every market innovation.  As FEMR recognised, while fines and sanctions have roles in deterring misconduct, they will not, on their own, bring about the cultural change needed. We must move from an excessive reliance on punitive ex post fines of firms to greater emphasis on more compelling ex ante incentives for individuals, and ultimately a more solid grounding in improved firm culture.  This starts with reducing opportunities for bad behaviour, for example, by overhauling the regulation of key benchmarks in FICC markets.  It requires compensation rules that align risk and reward.  In the UK, a significant proportion of variable compensation now must be deferred for a period of seven years.   To address the ‘rolling bad apples’ problem, mechanisms are now in place here to ensure that when individuals move on their history will be known to those who consider hiring them.  Firms will be required to share information on breaches of individual conduct rules, their fitness and propriety assessments and outcomes around subsequent disciplinary proceedings.  These measures are all very constructive but they are not yet sufficient.  That’s why the Bank of England supports initiatives that ensure firms and their employees take greater responsibility – individually and collectively – for their own conduct.  UK authorities have used their convening powers to encourage market participants to establish standards of market practice that are well understood, widely followed and, crucially, that keep pace with market developments.  Industry has responded.  The Banking Standards Board is promoting higher standards of conduct and competence across the UK banking system.  The global FICC Market Standards Board (FMSB) is                                                       2 The UK accounts for 40% of both global FX volumes and trades in OTC interest rate derivatives, and two-thirds of trading in international bonds.  More international banking activity is booked in London than anywhere else. And finance is one of the largest sectors of the UK economy.  Around 400,000 people are employed in financial services in London alone, 1.1 million across the country as whole.  Their enterprise contributes £115 billion to our national income, £80 billion to our exports and £70 billion to the Exchequer, equivalent to two-thirds of the NHS budget. 3 This is set out in more detail in the FEMR Progress Report being published today at: https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/fair-and-effective-markets 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 4  4   establishing readily understood standards for their markets.  And the global FX Committees have published the FX Global Code, the first globally consistent code of conduct for FX markets. But codes are of little use if nobody reads, follows or enforces them.   This is where the UK’s Senior Managers Regime (SMR) comes in.4  Senior Managers Regime The SMR gives teeth to voluntary codes by incentivising firms to develop, adopt and embed them.  It is very welcome that the FCA is currently consulting on proposals to recognise industry codes publicly under the SMR. By requiring identification of the most senior decision-makers, the SMR re-establishes the link between seniority and accountability, strengthens individual accountability, and reinforces collective responsibility. As the SMR starts to bed in, there are encouraging signs that it is making a difference. For firms, the SMR is clarifying and improving governance, accountability and decision-making.  For supervisors, the regime is helping identify weaknesses in governance and accountability, and it is helping them to encourage the necessary changes.  Adoption is spreading.  Some international firms are voluntarily adopting elements of the SMR’s certification requirements to strengthen their global operations.  A number of jurisdictions are applying the principles and features of the SMR.5   And elements of the regime are included as examples in the FSB’s recently published toolkit on governance frameworks.6 While we cannot eliminate misconduct, these measures should reduce its scale and frequency, and they will broaden the sanctions for bad behaviour.  All of this will help restore trust in financial markets so that they can work as effectively and efficiently as possible to serve the real economy.  Markets Forum 2018 Today marks an inflection point, when we can celebrate what has been achieved but then look ahead to future challenges.  The spirit and intention behind FEMR is that continual focus is required because markets continually evolve.                                                        4 The Government has legislated to extend the SM&CR to all other FSMA authorised financial services firms. As a first step, the Government will extend the Regime to insurance firms from 10 December 2018 and will confirm when the Regime will be extended to firms regulated solely by the FCA in due course. 5 The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission implemented a Manager in Charge Regime (MICR); the Australian Parliament has recently passed legislation establishing a Bank Executive Accountability Regime (BEAR); and the Monetary Authority of Singapore has published Proposed Guidelines on Individual Accountability and Conduct 6 The FSB Report on Strengthening Governance Frameworks to Mitigate Misconduct Risk can be found here:  http://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P200418.pdf  
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 5  5   That’s why the Bank and the FCA are taking a proactive, forward-looking approach to identifying vulnerabilities in hard and soft market infrastructure.  We see this as core to our institutional responsibilities.  Indeed, the Bank has made catalysing structural reforms in financial markets, such as the new risk-free benchmarks that I’ll turn to in a moment, one of its core strategic goals. But the authorities cannot future-proof alone.  We rely on industry to help us scan the landscape for emerging risks and to help determine ways to mitigate them.   We are encouraged by your efforts.  In particular, the FMSB is undertaking horizon scanning for future misconduct risks through its innovative behaviour cluster analysis; and the Global Foreign Exchange Committee, which is responsible for keeping the FX Global Code ‘alive’, has already identified areas of further work on spot FX market practices.7 With the leaders of the industry here, we hope that today’s discussions will identify emerging risks and challenges, and explore how we can all work together to address potential vulnerabilities as we continue to build real markets for the good the people of the UK and beyond.  In this spirit, before concluding, I want to briefly touch on one of the biggest challenges facing us right now – the transition to Risk Free Rates.  The move to new Risk Free Rates  Libor is a prime example of critical hard (market) infrastructure that has not kept up with market developments.  Libor is meant to measure the short-term unsecured funding costs of banks.  But the reality is that, since the financial crisis, Libor really has become the rate at which banks don’t lend to each other.  Bank funding markets have changed enormously.  Banks no longer take sufficient short-term wholesale deposits to form the basis for a robust transaction-based Libor benchmark.  As a result Libor is overly reliant on expert judgement rather than actual transactions.  And global markets remain overly reliant on Libor, a benchmark that may not exist beyond 2021.  That reliance is neither desirable nor sustainable.   That’s why authorities internationally have worked with market participants to identify alternative benchmarks based on actual transactions.  These are overnight rates – a relatively pure read on risk-free rates in each economy.   In sterling, the market has chosen SONIA, a benchmark now administered by the Bank of England.  In April we implemented reforms to SONIA that boosted the volume of transactions captured by a factor of three to £50bn per day.                                                         7 These areas are: the role that ‘cover and deal’ and similar trading models play in the FX market; how market participants adjust their pricing on E-Trading Platforms and when trading by voice; and, disclosures regarding last look practices. 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 6  6   The focus now is on transition.  Market participants in every sector and market that use Libor now need to come together to identify and resolve issues, change business practices, and adopt alternative benchmarks.  In sterling, over 90 institutions, including banks, law firms, corporates, asset managers, trade associations and infrastructure firms, are directly involved in this effort supported by the Bank and FCA. Transition to SONIA will bring a number of benefits. Market participants can have the confidence that SONIA faithfully represents conditions in a deep underlying market.   They can also be assured that SONIA’s design is robust to future changes in money markets because, if necessary, SONIA’s data inputs can evolve. Near risk-free rates like SONIA are a better reflection of the general level of interest rates than Libor – which is affected by fluctuations in the perceived credit quality of banks (as well as other technical factors as seen recently).  Interest payments for benchmark users should be less volatile as a result, especially in times of stress, and products referencing SONIA should provide a better hedge for duration risk. Over time the private sector will develop a wider range of products referencing SONIA.  Futures contracts have already been created.  We can expect Floating Rate Notes and loans referencing SONIA to follow.  The end point should be an ecosystem for interest rate markets which has an altogether healthier foundation than at present.   Developing the infrastructure around the near risk-free benchmarks globally, and assisting market participants in dealing with legacy Libor portfolios, is a significant opportunity for innovation.  Firms here in London are well placed to take advantage.   As mentioned, international authorities are working closely together, and I know Bill Dudley is going to pick up the baton and talk more about the transition to risk-free rates from a US perspective. It is an immense pleasure to introduce Bill. It is an honour that he is here at this Markets Forum to give his last keynote speech as President of the New York Federal Reserve.  And it is appropriate given his deep commitment to fighting misconduct and improving standards of behaviour in the institutions we regulate and supervise.  Bill had the wisdom to appreciate quickly how cultural and ethical issues lay at the heart of the global financial crisis, and he has been a consistent and strong voice in arguing for what needs to be done to improve individual behaviour, firm culture, and industry ethics. On behalf everyone, I would like to thank you Bill for your many, invaluable contributions throughout this exceptional period for financial markets and the global economy.  
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 7  7   On a personal note, I will greatly miss your deep technical expertise, open-mindedness, wisdom, good humour and friendship.  Today isn’t really goodbye but au revoir. Because, whether it is the financial system or as colleagues, we know the future will be better if we stay connected. 
Yves Mersch: Central bank risk management in times of monetarypolicy normalisationSpeech by Mr Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, atthe International Risk Management Conference, Paris, 8 June 2018.*   *   *Risk management has come a long way since Edward Altman introduced the z-score tomeasure the likelihood of bankruptcy in 1968, and the financial crisis has brought aboutsignificant changes in risk management for commercial banks and central banks alike.But as we now emerge from the crisis, we would do well to reflect on what should persist fromthat period, and what the “new normal” for risk management should be. So today I would like todiscuss what risk management has meant for the ECB in recent times, and what changes wecan expect as we approach a phase of monetary policy normalisation.But before I elaborate on this, I should note that we have entered the quiet period before the nextmonetary policy meeting of the ECB Governing Council, and therefore my remarks should beunderstood as high-level reflections and not be interpreted as containing any commitments orcomments on upcoming monetary policy decisions.Parallels between risk management at commercial and central banksRisk management has gained in importance in recent years for both commercial and centralbanks.The regulations that emerged following the crisis have led commercial banks to bolster their riskfunctions in a number of ways. They are now subject to more detailed and demanding capitalrequirements, higher standards for risk reporting and, in particular, more detailed rules for thebuilding of internal models. More recently, the Targeted Review of Internal Models (TRIM) waslaunched to assess banks’ compliance with these requirements and thereby reduceinconsistencies and unwarranted variability in the outputs of their internal models.The ECB’s involvement in risk management is perhaps most familiar in this context: as abanking supervisor. But the management and measurement of risks has also been of greatsignificance for the monetary policy side of our operations. The ECB, like other central banks,has expanded its balance sheet substantially in recent years, resulting in several changes in ourrisk management framework. For example, we have expanded the range of eligible collateral forour lending operations and begun purchasing financial assets outright, including a wide array ofprivate sector assets.While there are many parallels in the way that we and the commercial banks have managedrisks, there are also important differences due to our public mission as laid down in our mandate.First, we conduct a single monetary policy for the euro area as a whole. Though our creditoperations and risk mitigation measures are in some ways similar to collateralised lendingoperations by commercial banks, the financial assets we take as collateral and the lending ratewe set are the same for all borrowers. That, in turn, requires a risk control framework which aimsto achieve risk equivalence across all assets accepted as collateral.Second, our primary goal is to maintain price stability. So, unlike commercial banks whosefiduciary responsibility is to maximise their financial income, central banks have to consider thewider macroeconomic picture when they set their risk management frameworks.This is why central banks’ exposure to financial risks can – and may indeed have to – increase in1 1 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
order to honour their mandates, while commercial banks typically aim to reduce risks duringcrises. In exceptional times, central banks may need to take more risk on their own balancesheets so as to reduce risks for the financial system as a whole. This contributes to financialstability and, ultimately, to price stability.Still, this is not to say that managing financial risks is not important for implementing theEurosystem’s monetary policy. Quite the opposite, in fact! Just as a commercial bank mustcomply with its regulations, a central bank must follow its mandate and the risk managementprinciples therein. For us at the ECB, these principles, which were established long before weembarked on non-conventional policies, underpin all our policy measures.Broadly speaking, the principles are protection, consistency, simplicity and transparency. Theyimply that – if there are several monetary policy options that we can take to fulfil our mandate –we should select the measures that minimise our own exposure to financial risks. This idea,which underpins all risk management (including in commercial banking), is known as riskefficiency. In addition, our principles require risk management to be an integral part of ourdecision-making. And we embody transparency and simplicity by being rules-based and aspredictable as possible in our operations.This commitment to risk efficiency is vital for several reasons. First, central bank revenues arepublic funds, meaning any losses by central banks are losses for the public purse in each euroarea country. Second, losses can affect the financial independence of central banks andtherefore, potentially, their operational independence. Third, losses can harm our credibility andreputation in the eyes of the public, and thus their confidence in the central bank to maintain pricestability.For these reasons, our principles will continue to guide our approach to risk management in allour policy decisions. But as we now move towards a new phase of monetary policy, it is worthreflecting on what these principles imply for the future risk management framework.In my view, we should aim to return as closely as possible to the pre-crisis state. But we alsoneed to consider carefully whether some of the temporary measures should remain part of ourtoolkit. And since we have taken on new risks that will be on our balance sheet for a long time,we may need to retain certain elements of our current risk management framework.As monetary policy begins to normalise, there are three areas in particular where our riskmanagement framework needs to be reviewed.Risk management principles while returning to a more conventional monetary policyThe first relates to the changes we made to our collateral framework during the crisis to enablegreater access to central bank liquidity.When we launched the various vintages of our longer-term refinancing operations, we introducedin parallel a number of adjustments to our collateral eligibility criteria. These adjustmentscontributed to the sizeable take-up of our operations and their effectiveness in reinvigorating thebank lending channel. And maintaining risk equivalence in haircuts meant that broadening the setof eligible assets did not reduce the level of protection for the Eurosystem.But some of the measures introduced fragmentation into our collateral framework.Before the crisis, the Eurosystem operated on the concept of a single list. Its purpose was toenhance the level playing field across the euro area, to promote equal treatment forcounterparties and issuers, and to increase the overall transparency of the collateral framework.This changed, however, with the introduction of the temporary additional credit claims (ACC)framework in 2012.23 2 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
The temporary ACC framework deviates from the single list principle by allowing individualnational central banks to specify their own frameworks adapted to their local needs, albeit fulfillingcertain agreed minimum risk management requirements. This was acceptable to combat thesevere financial tensions and the uneven distribution of collateral in the euro area at the timeACCs were introduced. But clearly, once out of crisis mode, we would not want such arenationalisation of our collateral framework to persist.So I do not see the case for maintaining national extensions to the common collateral frameworkin the form they are in today. At the same time, since ACCs represent a considerable source ofcollateral for our long-term lending operations, there might be a case for retaining them in adifferent form.One option would be to return to the fully fledged single list of collateral that excludes ACCs.Another would be to introduce stronger harmonisation into any future ACC framework, whichcould either be part of the regular framework or part of a state-contingent framework. The keyissue is that any future framework should remove the fragmentation we see today.Other temporary measures introduced during the crisis have less bearing on fragmentation. Forinstance, we also widened eligibility requirements for collateral, such as for certain asset-backedsecurities, and accepted non-euro denominated collateral. We did all this to achieve a specificmonetary policy goal; but once we reach that goal and liquidity demand declines, there should beless need for those exceptional measures to continue. Of course, they will remain “on the shelf”to be used again, as necessary, to fulfil our monetary policy aim.A central bank should be flexible and may need to have many instruments at its disposal toachieve its mandate. But it should not take higher risks than necessary.So as we head down the path of monetary policy normalisation, we will have to decide whethersome temporary measures need to be jettisoned, included in a state-contingent framework, ortransformed into harmonised, more permanent measures.Since the last of our long-term lending operations will only mature in the first quarter of 2021, thisdiscussion does not need to be concluded today – and many questions are still open. But in anycase, changes in this area will involve careful consideration, since experience has repeatedlyshown that each crisis needs a tailored response.The second area where our risk management framework needs to be reviewed is the risk controlframework for our asset purchase programme (APP).We will retain this framework beyond the horizon of our net asset purchases since, for anextended period of time past that horizon, principal payments from maturing securitiespurchased under the APP will be reinvested. For as long as we keep outright portfolios on ourbalance sheet, the principles behind the risk control measures, including eligibility criteria,purchase limits, benchmarks ensuring diversification and the different risk-sharing agreements,will continue to apply.Still, in the reinvestment phase, some criteria and risk control parameters may warrantrecalibration. This is to ensure that – given changes in portfolio composition when bonds matureand proceeds are reinvested – overall risk exposure does not increase. Moreover, withsignificantly lower volumes of purchases and the related increase in operational flexibility, someparameter adjustments may be possible that would actually contribute to risk efficiency gains.The third area for review is how our counterparty and collateral framework should adapt to apost-crisis financial system. Certainly, in the future we will rely more on our own judgement onthe quality of assets and counterparties and consider further expanding the Eurosystem’sinternal credit assessment capabilities. The crisis highlighted the importance of having more4 3 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
information on these aspects.This implies, among other things, further enhancing our due diligence on external credit ratings,for which greater transparency on the judgements underlying these ratings is essential. And itimplies making better use of supervisory information. The introduction of European bankingsupervision has brought about fundamental improvements in this regard, as it facilitates theassessment of relevant information within the legal limits of the separation principle.Moreover, we will have to balance the aim of returning to the simplicity of our previous frameworkwith adapting to the new realities of the financial system. For example, we will need to keep theflexibility to apply the collateral framework to financial innovations, especially complex newfinancial products. The new “simple, transparent and standardised” securitisation regulation is acase in point. It will allow us to better assess the collateral we accept.At the same time, if financial innovations simply present new types of risks, we will not be soaccommodating. This is also a key lesson of the crisis. We will forcefully deal with new types ofsecurities whose risks may not yet have been fully appreciated.ConclusionLet me conclude.Thanks to our stable principles, the Eurosystem’s risk management framework has successfullyweathered the challenges of the financial crisis. The size and type of our operations changed, asdid the assets we accepted as collateral. But our principles stayed the same.Like risk management in the banking sector, central bank risk management has to evolve withthe times. So we need to reflect on where our principles will lead us in a post-crisis landscape.Most importantly, we need to start thinking about a financial risk management framework that willbe appropriate in an environment of more conventional monetary policy.While the benchmark for this future framework should be the pre-crisis state, it is not clearwhether we can return entirely to the previous status quo. Instead, we might have to apply whatwe have learnt from the crisis, retain what is useful for the future, and leave behind things whosetime has passed.This will enable us to rely on a framework that is transparent and robust, but also flexible enoughto deal with the challenges of the future.ECB (2015), “The financial risk management of the Eurosystem’s monetary policy operations”.In 2010, the Governing Council approved a set of “Principles of the risk control framework for the Eurosystem’scredit operations”.The ECB’s Governing Council also decided in December 2011 to enable national central banks to accept ascollateral performing additional credit claims (ACCs) that satisfy specific eligibility criteria. Such assets do notbelong to the single list and they are also subject to a separate ECB Guideline: Guideline of the ECB of 9 July2014 on additional temporary measures relating to Eurosystem refinancing operations and eligibility ofcollateral and amending Guideline ECB/2007/9 (recast) (ECB/2014/31).This expansion included certain short-term debt instruments and derogations for own-use of government-guaranteed bank bonds. Non-euro denominated eligible assets included those denominated in pound sterling,US dollars or yen.1234 4 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
SPEECH  Side 1 af 8 BY GOVERNOR LARS ROHDE  AT THE VL SUMMIT 7 JUNE      CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY   EUROPE – AN ECONOMIC POWERHOUSE IN THE FUTURE? Thank you for inviting me to speak at this summit.  It is a great pleasure to have the chance to share my views on how to fos-ter sustainable growth in Europe.  The subject is more important than ever. Let me start by emphasizing one thing: Despite imperfections – the Euro-pean Single Market has been an engine of growth.  It has acted as a catalyst for trade and the free exchange of labour, capi-tal and knowhow.  At a time when anti-globalization draws headlines, these fundamental rights should not be taken for granted.  In fact, I believe they are at the core for making Europe more prosperous in the future. **** [Slide 2: Key messages] Today, I would like to highlight four observations:   First, Europe is better than its reputation.  Economic performance keeps abreast with other advanced economies. The rumours of its demise are simply exaggerated.       7 June 2018 
  Side 2 af 8 Second, all major advanced economies will have to adjust to lower po-tential growth.  It's a fact, as headwind from slowing productivity growth and ageing kicks in. Europe is no exception.  Third, free global competition is the main driver of innovation.   Europe suffers from an R&D gap relative to global hotspots. But innova-tion is not a zero-sum game:  Prosperous neighbours do not make Europeans worse off. In fact, pro-ductive rivalry stimulates new ideas.   Finally, Europe needs a fully developed Single Market for financial ser-vices.  The Single Market has been an engine of growth for decades but is still incomplete.  The Banking Union is an important step towards allowing consumers and businesses to reap the benefits from cross-border competition.  It will al-so be the case for Denmark – if we join. Please allow me to expand on these points one by one.  *** [Slide 3: Europe is better than its reputation] The organizers of this debate asked us to answer the question: How can Europe crack the code for getting back on the growth track?  Well, it implies that we somehow went off track. But is Europe really do-ing that badly? I don’t think so.  I will argue that the recent growth performance in most parts of Europe is in line with that of other advanced economies. No better, no worse.  The European Union is home to a diverse set of countries. They are at quite different stages of economic and institutional development. Just looking at averages is too simplistic.  [Slide 4: Europe is a tale of three] Europe is tale of three stories: North, South and East.  
  Side 3 af 8 The enlargement of the European Union towards the East has been an economic success. But it has not been without challenges.  But the level of prosperity in the new member states has been converg-ing towards that of the core.  And it has supported the overall growth in Europe.  There is certainly an element of catching up behind this. And moving up the value chain will become increasingly important to keep momentum. The South is the main source of Europe's dismal economic reputation. It has been a clear growth laggard over the past decade.  Countries in the south have been drifting away from Germany's GDP per capita since the financial crisis.  While much has been done to restore competiveness, many challenges have been left unaddressed.  There is still a clear need to tackle structural imbalances, rigid labour markets and weak productivity dynamics.     The North is home to the most prosperous and competitive economies in Europe. Their economic performance over the past ten years has kept abreast with the USA and other major advanced economies.  While the Nordic region is in good shape, it will have to remain on the toes to stay ahead in the future.   When taking stock of these three stories, it is not evident to me that Eu-rope is underperforming.  GDP growth in the European Union reached 2.4 per cent in 2017. Not since the boom period in the mid-2000s we find higher growth rates.     In sum, Europe is better than its reputation. *** [Slide 5: Ageing will weigh on future growth] The growth observed last year might be as good as it gets.  Ageing populations and weak productivity gains will weigh on growth in advanced economies. Europe is no exception.  
  Side 4 af 8 We have to adjust our expectations accordingly.  Demographics will shape the growth potential of Europe.  The share of Europeans above 65 years went from 12 per cent in 1970 to 20 per cent in 2015. And it is expected to exceed 30 per cent by 2050.  Other advanced economies, most notably Japan, face even greater chal-lenges from an aging population.    This demographic transition has important implications for economic growth.  Our estimates suggest that workforce ageing can reduce GDP per capita growth in Europe by 0.5 percentage points each year over the period 2020-2050. The demographic headwind can to some extent be mitigated by working longer. The spotlight should be turned to policies that foster productivity gains. **** [Slide 6: Europe faces an R&D gap] Advanced economies have turned towards sectors where productivity gains are harder to achieve. The development of new ideas is therefore essential for unlocking future growth.  Historically, Europe has produced some of the most successful compa-nies in the world.  Its starting point is not bad. But Europe suffers from an R&D gap relative to global hotspots. It spends less than 2 per cent of GDP on research and development each year.   This is significantly below the Americans and about half of what the front-runners in South Korea invest.  [Slide 7: Global innovation is the engine innovation] 
  Side 5 af 8 The vanguard of innovation is not in Europe. The hotspots dominating global patent applications are Tokyo, Shenzhen, San Francisco, Osaka and Seoul.  The top European region – Munich – is number 13. Back in 1989 seven European regions were in top 20. Today, it is down to three.  Asia is increasingly the innovation centre today. But the relative decline of Europe is not a problem in itself. Prosperous neighbours do not make Europeans worse off.  *** I said earlier that Europe is a tale of three stories. When it comes to pa-tent applications, there are clear regional differences as well. [Slide 8: Regional dimension to European innovation]  The most innovative clusters are located in Central Europe and Scandina-via. They will have to generate growth by pushing the frontier.  Free global markets and competition are the best catalysts for companies looking to spur new ideas.  They keep businesses on their toes. They are the real drivers of innova-tion.   **** I see two key challenges to innovation in Europe.  Europe faces shortage of skills. Eight out of ten innovating companies consider the lack of skilled staff a barrier to investment.  Well-trained workers are essential for creating an economic powerhouse in the future.    Strengthening venture capital would support creative disruption. An OECD study suggests that the US venture capital market is significantly larger than the European.  Patterns are changing in investment finance. Europe is a bank-based economy.  
  Side 6 af 8 But bank credit is not always ideal for intangible investments. These in-vestments are riskier and harder to collateralize.  Access to a broad range of financing sources provides companies with better opportunities for innovation.  In this respect the Capital Markets Union Initiative has an important role to play by stimulating alternative sources of risk financing. *** The decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union is re-grettable.  But Brexit has had at least one positive side effect: It has increased the awareness in the remaining 27 EU member states of the significance and benefits of the Single Market.  [SLIDE 9: EU needs a single market for financial services] The Single Market provides the citizens and the companies in the EU with incredible opportunities.  It provides access to purchase and offer goods and services freely in a huge market place.  Via Brexit, it has become crystal clear just how big an advantage this is.  It now seems to be more widely accepted, that the maintenance and con-tinued development of this market is a key driver for economic growth in our countries. The Single Market is far from fully developed in all sectors. One example is the banking sector.  There has been a tradition to see banks as companies requiring special protection – and ultimately government support in order to survive.  With the Banking Union a big step has been taken in the direction of al-lowing banks to function on market terms – without compromising finan-cial stability.  The Single Supervisory Mechanism and the Single Resolution Mechanism go a long way in establishing a level playing field for banks.  
  Side 7 af 8 It opens up for much wider cross border competition in financial services.  *** [Slide 10: A level playing field for banks is important] Furthermore, the common framework for recovery and resolution of banks (the BRRD) is essential for ensuring that a failing bank – as any other kind of private company – may be resolved without the use of gov-ernment funds.  In other words: Give banks the right to fail! The Danish government has announced that a decision on Denmark's participation in the Banking Union will be taken by the autumn of 2019. While fully acknowledging that it is a political decision, it is our view in Danmarks Nationalbank that it would make good sense for Denmark to join.  Danish banks face competition in the Nordic region but in reality not on a European scale.  We are making a great effort to handle the challenges arising from cross border banking in the Nordic countries through numerous arrangements and agreements between relevant authorities.  The Banking Union provides a solution to these challenges on a Europe-an scale. Furthermore, the increased competition following from joining the Bank-ing Union would be healthy for the Danish financial sector.  In the Banking Union Danish banks would compete on harmonized terms in a much larger market.  Increased competition is the path to more growth – and indeed to more favourable conditions for consumers and non-financial companies. If you ask the telecom industry today, they might tell you that the life was cosier before the liberalisation of their industry. We have seen this in many areas, for example in telecommunications. This is a key reason why we recommend that Denmark joins the Banking Union,  
  Side 8 af 8 Joining the Banking Union would mean that we fully join the Single Mar-ket for banking services. It would be to the benefit of citizens and companies, but not necessarily to the banks.

Page 1 of 8      Remarks by Daniel Mminele, Deputy Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, at the annual Financial Markets Department cocktail function Johannesburg 10 May 2018  Ladies and gentlemen, good evening.  It is with pleasure that I welcome you to the annual cocktail function of the Financial Markets Department (FMD) of the South African Reserve Bank (SARB), which is now in its 12th year. We are greatly honoured by your presence tonight. The deal I struck with our Financial Markets Department for moving this function from Pretoria to Johannesburg was that I would be allowed to speak for 90 minutes.  Introduction  Allow me in welcoming you to this event, to make some brief observations about financial market developments since we last met and to touch on what could be in store for us in the period ahead. I would also like to draw your attention to two of our initiatives that are gathering momentum, and which will require your cooperation over the next few months. I know that our views on domestic monetary policy are always of interest to financial market participants, but as we are on the eve of entering into the closed period for our next Monetary Policy Committee meeting, which starts on 22nd May, I shall refrain from any comments today, and ask for your patience until you get our most recent take in about two weeks’ time.   The global financial markets backdrop  Since the last FMD cocktail function, global financial markets have had to ponder over a plethora of developments, including the strengthening synchronised global growth environment, changing perceptions around monetary policy normalisation, rising 
Page 2 of 8  financial market volatility, threats of escalating trade conflicts, and rising geopolitical tensions. In many ways, the period since our last cocktail function to now has been one of transition; from markets being very complacent about risks, to the current environment in which risk-sensitivity levels appear to be rising again, even against still relatively overall supportive financial conditions. The initial period was characterised by volatility being subdued across a broad range of asset classes, in certain instances with indicators touching record lows. While US interest rate futures increased to reflect expectations that the Fed would hike interest rates, and also appeared to factor-in that the US Treasury would issue more short-term debt,  the anticipated pace of such interest rates increases was expected to follow a relatively slow and gradual profile. The other major economies were seen to be still somewhat behind the US with regard to changes to their monetary policy settings. One puzzling issue for the markets had been the fact that even with expectations for better growth in the US, further stimulus coming from the implementation of tax reforms, both of which pointed to possible further hike by the Fed, the USD was weakening. During this period of a relatively benign global environment, capital flows to emerging markets also held up rather well.  We have now moved into a period where the market is adjusting to the strength of the cyclical growth momentum that has started to put upward pressure on short-term interest rates and push volatility higher. Adjustments to monetary policy by way of policy rate increases and reducing the pace of asset purchases are now featuring more prominently when assessing future developments. This has already been witnessed with the 10-year US Treasury yield rising to the psychologically significant level of 3% – a level last seen, albeit briefly, in 2013. Now all market-generated paths for policy rates suggest an upward trajectory. Concomitantly, the US dollar has been regaining the ground lost previously, which had seen the USD reaching a three-year low in February 2018.    Developments in the domestic financial markets  You are all very familiar with developments in the domestic markets, which will allow me to be very brief. Prior to the recent dollar strength, but subsequent to the FMD cocktail function last year, price formulation in the domestic financial markets reflected a confluence of idiosyncratic and global factors. 
Page 3 of 8  The rand was range-bound during the second and third quarters of last year, trading between R12.62 and R13.95 against a steadily weakening US dollar. The benign global environment had to an extent helped shield domestic financial assets from unfavourable domestic growth developments as well as political and policy uncertainty. However, in the latter part of the year, domestic factors were more dominant and resulted in the rand depreciating to a year’s high of R14.47 in November 2017, before subsequently rebounding on positive sentiment towards domestic fiscal and political developments as well as concomitant views from credit rating agencies which were positively received by the market, which included Moody’s Investor Service retaining South Africa’s sovereign credit rating at investment grade level and improving the outlook to stable from negative. A key factor in Moody’s assessment was their reduced nervousness about South Africa’s rising economic and fiscal risks, and higher levels of comfort with regard to efforts to restore the strength of key institutions.  The strengthening rand led to a sharp decline in local bond yields, with the yield on the benchmark R186 declining by 141 basis points to 7.98% while the 30-year R2048 bond’s yield compressed by 146 basis points as investors repriced the political risk premium. The five-year sovereign credit default swap spread improved by 60 basis points from its peak of just over 200 basis points in November 2017.   In recent weeks, the rand has been relatively volatile with a weakening profile currently trading around R12.40 to the USD. In line with developments in other emerging markets, this development has been more reflective of USD strength rather than exhibiting rand-intrinsic weakness.   What do we need to look out for?  While the degree of monetary stimulus of recent years has so far had surprisingly little impact on inflation, the debate remains as to whether this pattern is likely to continue, or rather at what speed any changes will occur, now that some economies are operating with positive output gaps.   There are some concerns that the shift to higher volatility may not necessarily be orderly against the background of fears of protectionism, increased geo-political risks, 
Page 4 of 8  and uncertainty over the pace of monetary policy normalisation. This may lead to an abrupt tightening of financial conditions, which in turn may curtail global growth.  Even with some recent corrections, asset valuations remain generally stretched, and  currency mismatches arising from large amounts of USD denominated debt incurred to take advantage of low rates (by both corporates and sovereigns), could make financial markets vulnerable to financial conditions tightening at a faster pace than currently anticipated.   At the most recent IMF/World Bank Spring Meetings another issue that received particular attention was the rising level of global debt, which if unchecked has the potential to trigger financial instability in the future, weighing on growth and undermining financial assets.  These developments may harbour some serious implications for emerging markets. Firstly, risk-aversion may reduce the attractiveness of the emerging market assets, including carry-trade related transactions, which may negatively affect portfolio flows to these markets, as witnessed in the sharp pull-back in flows since mid-April 2018. Secondly, export-dependent emerging economies will be impacted as commodity prices tend to fall when the dollar strengthens. Lastly, a stronger dollar would put pressure on emerging markets with large dollar liabilities, further increasing their financial vulnerabilities.   We have already seen some early signs of these risks materialising for emerging economies, with a number of emerging market currencies, including the rand, weakening not only to the dollar, but also to other advanced economy currencies, such as the euro and the yen. But admittedly others have been tested a lot more when compared to South Africa.  A key risk to the outlook on the rand remains the possibility of accelerated monetary policy tightening by central banks in the advanced economies, particularly in the US. Escalating trade conflicts and geo-political developments, present another risk factor that needs to be monitored carefully.  
Page 5 of 8  The impact of trade conflicts could result in decreased demand for South African exports and potentially higher volatility in currency markets.   Key initiatives to strengthen the domestic markets   Let me turn to the two major initiatives undertaken by the SARB to strengthen domestic financial markets.   The first one relates to a consultation paper on selected interest rate benchmarks in South Africa that we will be releasing in the next few weeks. This initiative partly emanates from a coordinated response by international regulators and central banks, to the instances of attempted and actual manipulation of key global interest rate benchmarks and reference interest rates, in particular the London Interbank Offered Rate in 2012. Consequently, the Official Sector Steering Group1, established under the auspices of the Financial Stability Board, recommended that interest rate benchmarks should be underpinned by transaction data and that risk-free interest rates benchmarks should be developed to support certain financial instruments, including derivative contracts.   This initiative was also informed by research conducted into the robustness, representativeness and sustainability of the Johannesburg Interbank Average Rate (JIBAR), given its wide usage as a reference rate in South Africa, especially the 3-month JIBAR. The research indicated some shortcomings in JIBAR, which do not allow it to fully perform its role as a key indicator of underlying market conditions.  The majority of floating interest rate securities and derivatives contracts are linked to the three-month JIBAR, which underscores JIBAR’s importance in the transmission of the SARB’s monetary policy stance through the financial market channel. This work is not limited to the JIBAR, but covers selected other interest rate benchmarks in South Africa. Following the release of the consultation paper containing certain reform proposals, there will be a two-month period for comments, to be followed by a final implementation document in due course.                                                               1 In July 2013, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) established the Official Sector Steering Group, which comprises senior officials from central banks and regulatory agencies, to focus on the FSB’s work on interest rate benchmarks given the significant role they play in the global financial system. 
Page 6 of 8  I would like to call upon you to please engage with the document and provide us with your comments. This is a very important initiative for financial markets development in South Africa.   The second initiative that I would like to update you on relates to the work of the Financial Markets Review Committee (FMRC). In the 2017 national Budget speech, the Minister of Finance announced that the SARB, the Financial Services Board and National Treasury had begun working on a comprehensive financial markets review under the leadership of former SARB Senior Deputy Governor James Cross. The objective is to review the standards, practices and issues of governance, accountability and incentives in wholesale financial markets. The FMRC will consider the mechanisms that are necessary to augmenting the implementation and governance of conduct standards by market participants. Furthermore, it will identify areas where changes to legislation are needed to support a new conduct framework for wholesale financial markets.   One of the painful lessons of the great financial crisis has been the importance of conduct in financial markets, and how poor conduct can end up being globally systemic. It is therefore important that we strengthen domestic and global collaborative efforts between the private and public sector, aimed at building trust as an important contribution to creating effective, fair, and resilient markets.  The review is well underway and much progress has been made already. You may have participated in the FMRC questionnaire or in meetings held by the project team. It is envisaged, that a draft report will be published later in the year for public comment. Again, this will be an important document for you to interact with and provide comments.   There are other important initiatives that the SARB has undertaken in the past year, in relation to financial markets, many of which were in collaboration with you as market participants, such as the launch of South African Foreign Exchange Committee (SAFXC).   
Page 7 of 8  The SAFXC will be member of the Global Foreign Exchange Committee, the body that has been tasked with the ongoing maintenance of the FX Global Code and ensuring continuing collaboration between central banks and the private sector on developing principles for good governance in the foreign exchange market2. The SARB has previously announced that as from 01 September 2018 it will only transact with counterparties in the foreign exchange market that have committed to adhering to the FX Global Code.  Some of the other initiatives are contained in FMD’s newsletter, the FMD Update, copies of which are both available here tonight as well as on the SARB website3.    Conclusion  Allow me now to conclude by saying that we have come through another busy and challenging year, characterised by high levels of volatility and uncertainly in our markets. The collaboration between the SARB and financial market participants continued in a constructive atmosphere and ensured the orderly functioning of our markets in the wake of these challenges. Our collaboration extends to many of you being our partners in our monetary policy implementation activities, government debt operations, sharing of market information and analyses, as well as participation in various market forums. We look forward to our continued cooperation so as to enhance the effectiveness, integrity and resilience of our financial markets.   Let me take this opportunity to thank our financial markets team, under the leadership of Mr Leon Myburgh, for their hard work and dedication to the work of the Bank during the past year. Many projects had to be managed simultaneously while keeping the day-to-day operations running smoothly.   I should also mention that Mr Callie Hugo will be going on retirement later this year, and that this will be his last attendance of the annual cocktail function in his current capacity.                                                               2 http://www.resbank.co.za/Markets/South_African_Foreign_Exchange_Committee/Pages/Announcements.aspx 3 http://www.resbank.co.za/Pages/default.aspx 
Page 8 of 8  I believe that I can speak for all of us in conveying our gratitude to Callie for the great work he has done over many years in contributing to the development of our financial markets, and being one of the key links between the SARB and financial market participants. Even if somewhat pre-mature, because you are still around and have some work to do, we wish you all the best for the future, Callie.   Last but not least, a very special thank you must also go to Ms Sharlay Madalane, from the SARB protocol section for her assistance in organising this event.  Ladies and gentlemen, please enjoy the rest of the evening.   Thank you.  
Anita Angelovska Bezoska: Let's get digitalSpeech by Ms Anita Angelovska Bezhoska, Governor of the National Bank of the Republic ofMacedonia, at the NBRM’s 11th Conference on Payments and Market Infrastructures “Let's GetDigital”, Ohrid, 6-8 June 2018.*   *   *Distinguished guests,Ladies and gentlemen,It is my great pleasure to welcome you to the 11th edition of the Conference on Payments andMarket Infrastructures hosted by the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia.The organization of this Conference has been traditionally supported by De NederlandscheBank for which we are very thankful and over time, this initial bilateral cooperation attractedinvolvement of other central banks and IFIs. In this context, I would like to extend our appreciationto Banco de Portugal for its contribution in the past editions, as well as to the Bank of Italy, theNational Bank of Belgium and the National Bank of Serbia for their contribution to thisConference. Also, particularly valuable is the continued participation of the European CentralBank, the Bank for International Settlement and the European Commission given the prominentrole these institutions play in the payments area.This year’s conference focuses on digital transformation, a process that is heavily penetratingacross all segments of our business and private lives and will take even greater significance inthe years to come. The digital transformation in finance has been rapidly evolving with theemergence of Fintech sector. According to the Ernst&Young’s Fintech Adoption Index, one-thirdof consumers utilize at least two or more fintech services and they are becoming increasinglyaware of FinTech as a part of their daily lives. The FinTech Adoption Index for services offered byFinTech organizations under five broad categories – money transfers and payment services,financial planning tools, savings and investments, borrowing and insurance, indicates that moneytransfers and payment services are continuing to lead the FinTech change, with adoptionstanding at 50% in 2017 and 88% of consumers anticipating of doing so in the future. Thus, theglobal payments industry is currently undergoing a paradigm shift driven by rapid advances, theinflux of new technologies and evolving consumer behavior as digital generations come of age.The emerging FinTech enhances the transformative power of digital payments via innovation.The irruption of digital payments relates to its many opportunities. Embracing paymentsdigitalization has the potential to substantially reduce the costs, increase the efficiency andenable broader access to payment services. With the rise of new payment digitaltechnologies developed by the FinTech, and increasingly adopted by banks, consumers andmerchants nowadays have a wide range of payment products to choose from. Innovationdevelopments, such as instant payments, payment initiation services, person-to-person mobilepayments and contactless proximity payments have the digitization process accompanied byinnovative solutions in their essence. The payment innovations and digitization process also havean impact on the transformation of payment market infrastructures. These developments,however, have raised various issues related to the requirements for bank openness, customersecurity, transparency and trust in the payment services market as well as consumer rightsprotection.Consequently, the regulators have to adopt appropriate legislative framework that supportsdigitalization, innovation and competition, but also take care of security and protection. In thiscontext, it can be noticed that the European Union is a global leader in this domain. By revisingthe Payment Services Directive (PSD2), the European Union enables stronger competition and 1 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
innovation by allowing entrance of FinTech payment service providers that will eventually lead togreater choice and better prices for consumers, it will fosters cyber resilience of the paymentservice providers as well as enhance protection of payment services users. In this way, theEuropean Union created a sound legal framework for digitalized payments landscape thatenhances the integration of the single payment. At the same time, it sets an example for othercountries around the world how to support digitalization trends by balancing between innovationand competition, on the one hand, and security and protection, on the other hand. The newregulatory framework implies that banks will no longer only be competing against banks, buteveryone offering financial services, i.e. the customers will be able to create a set of providers ofdifferent financial services instead of relining on one bank for all services. The belief that non-bank FinTech companies will play a significant role in the future financial landscape is wellestablished if we look at investments in fintech industry. The cumulative investments globallyhave more than ten-doubled the last five years and are estimated to exceed $150bn the next 3-5years. This, in addition to changed customer expectation and increased digitalisation, may be thereason why today we are witnessing a trend of stronger cooperation between banks andfintechs, including in the area of innovation labs.The new technologies, such as blockchain and distributed ledger technology, though youngand still-evolving, show the potential of restructuring financial industry, even encouragingdiscussions for cashless society with central bank digital currencies replacing the fiat money andunderpinning the proliferation of cryptocurrencies. The cryptocurrencies have registered aspectacular rise – in 2017 their market valuation increased from USD 30 billion to USD 400billion, and widened, with the rapid increase of “initial coin offerings” – fundraising facility for start-up investors. So, are the cryptocurrencies, although unregulated becoming a substitute for fiatmoney?  Are they incorporating the basic features of the fiat money such as being a medium ofexchange, store of value and unit of account? Despite the rising trend, they play a marginal roleglobally as a medium of exchange in comparison with standard payment options; as they are notbacked by legal authority and are marked by high value volatility and rather illiquid non-regulatedmarkets, they obviously cannot be treated as unit of account and store of value. On the otherhand, they may lead to creation of bubbles that down the road may burst. Against thisbackground, at the last meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bank governors it wasacknowledged that technological innovation may be conducive to higher efficiency andinclusiveness of the financial system. Many risks, however, were also pinpointed with theirproliferation – consumer and investor protection, market integrity, tax evasion, money launderingand terrorist financing.In this changing and challenging environment, staying aside is not an option for theRepublic of Macedonia. To tackle the rising challenges, we have already drafted a new Lawon payment services and payment systems (in cooperation with the Ministry of Finance)which transposes the PSD2 as well as other European Union relevant directives andregulations in the payments area. The new payment regulation aims to boost the competition inthe traditionally bank dominated payments market by opening the entrance for FinTechcompanies which can provide innovative payment services as well as establish and operate newpayment systems. At the same time, we assert our focus on maintaining financial stability byenhancing the resilience of payment market infrastructures which are being assessed againstthe Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures. In this context, the largest retail paymentsystem in the Republic of Macedonia established a Guarantee Scheme in 2017 which is inaccordance with the regulation of the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia that aims toeffect the same-day settlement and thus, minimize the liquidity risk in the important paymentsystem in case of a participant default. Furthermore, we also engaged in facilitating cross-border payments in euro in 2017 by establishing a link between our RTGS paymentsystem MIPS and TARGET2, which relies on the highly appreciated cooperation with Bank ofItaly. And we do not stop here. Our recent efforts have been focused on building a Strategy forreducing the cash usage and thus, increasing the digitalization and cashless payments, which 2 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
is a joint project of the central bank, the Ministry of Finance and the banking community.  During the following three days, the lecturers will address all the above relevant developments inthe payment market. The conference agenda includes a variety of interesting topics, includingthe European payment landscape and legislation with a special focus on PSD2, instantpayments, T2 & T2S consolidation project, collateral management system, recent work of CPMIand latest trends in central bank oversight. This year’s agenda also covers themes related tocryptocurrencies, central bank digital currencies and distributed ledger technology and cyberresilience. The active participation of the conference is provided and encouraged through panelsession on “Payments challenges in an integrating world”, in which panelists from paymentinstitutions and payment systems will be exchanging thoughts and ideas. Last but not least is theexpected interactive participation in the working groups scheduled for the last day of the event.I look forward to the discussions and wish all the delegates an enjoyable and rewardingconference, as inspiring as its location – the beautiful city of Ohrid and the Ohrid Lake which Ihope you will be able to enjoy too in the following Conference days.Thank you! 3 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
Jens Weidmann: Reforms for a stable monetary unionSpeech by Dr Jens Weidmann, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank and Chairman of theBoard of Directors of the Bank for International Settlements, at the annual reception of theMinister President of the German state of Hesse, Brussels, 5 June 2018.*   *   *1 Introductory remarksMinister President BouffierThank you for your kind words.I am delighted to see such a large number of guests and would like to greet the representativesof the diplomatic corps, the members of Parliament, the representatives of the EuropeanCommission, the Council and other EU institutions, the members of the state government ofHesse, and all the other members of our audience today.I have lived and worked in Hesse for many years now – in the beautiful Rheingau region and inthe buzzing metropolis of Frankfurt, to be precise – and have long since come to feel at homethere. Hesse is not only in the middle of Germany, it is also at the heart of Europe.The political cabaret artist Matthias Beltz once said: “The people of Hesse are surrounded bymasses of Germans. They have no access to the sea, the Alps or foreign countries, so theyhave no direct contact with freedom.” But luckily, freedom comes to us. Hesse, and especiallythe area around Frankfurt, has an international character, and the region’s cosmopolitanatmosphere makes it an easy and enjoyable place to live.At the same time, Hesse is home to several EU institutions. One of these is the EuropeanCentral Bank (ECB), which turned twenty a few days ago. It commenced its tasks on1 June 1998 in Frankfurt, a few months before the start of the third stage of Economic andMonetary Union.2 20 years of the euroIn the two decades since it was introduced, the euro has proven a success. The original promiseof a stable currency has been kept – the euro is stable both internally and externally. At 1.7 % onaverage over the last 20 years, the rate of inflation is lower than many people expected.It is therefore no surprise that support for the euro among the general public is high. According tothe latest Eurobarometer survey, three-quarters (74 %) of respondents in the euro area are infavour of the single currency, while only one in five (21 %) is against (the idea of) the euro. Insome countries, Germany included, the approval rating is higher than 80 %, even.However, these positive survey results should not obscure the fact that the euro’s seconddecade was rife with crises and problems: a financial crisis, an economic crisis, a Europeandebt crisis, a banking crisis, a double recession and high levels of unemployment. Severalcountries experienced a prolonged period of economic weakness and the necessary adjustmentmeasures brought with them social hardship.Figuratively speaking, you could say that the euro had an easy childhood but a difficultadolescence.Over the last few years, the Eurosystem’s central banks have faced unfamiliar challenges, andnot just in their core area of responsibility, which is that of ensuring price stability. During thecrisis, they were to some extent forced to act as crisis response units, taking them to the outer 1 / 8BIS central bankers' speeches
edge of their mandate for a while.In an interview last week, Otmar Issing warned: “Politicians have it easy. They rely on the ECB tosort everything out. But that isn’t going to work in the long term.”The dialogue between member states has also taken on a harsher tone at times. But monetaryunion was actually a project intended to encourage European integration and ultimately evenbring about deeper international friendship.All the same, I would like to stress that, in many ways, the euro area is in better shape today thanit was before the crisis. This is thanks to measures taken by its member states as well aschanges to the structure of the monetary union, both of which I will now focus on briefly.3 Reforms in the euro area3.1 Adjustment progress in the member statesThe crisis brought home to all of us what being part of a monetary union means and involves.And the way the countries that were hit the hardest by the crisis have tackled the roots of theproblems and have regained their competitiveness, for example, is truly remarkable and receivestoo little recognition.In Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Spain and Cyprus, for instance, average unit labour cost growth wasabove the euro-area average in the pre-crisis period (1999–2007). This was a contributing factorto these countries’ loss of competitiveness.Since the crisis, unit labour costs in all five of these countries have grown more slowly than theeuro area average. This has made their economies more competitive.The structural reforms already undertaken are also beginning to bear fruit and have contributed tothe upturn. Take structural unemployment, for instance, which has gone down by just over onepercentage point in the euro area, by slightly more in Spain, and by as much as 5 and7 percentage points respectively in Portugal and Ireland, thus showing that there is more at workhere than just the upbeat state of the economy.Current account deficits, some of which were very high, have also been balanced or even turnedinto surpluses.It would be tragic if, given all this, reforms were to be rolled back or consolidation gainssquandered. Instead, we should build on the successes that have been achieved.Incidentally, this also goes for countries such as Germany, which weathered the crisis fairly well.3.2 Changes to the governance framework to dateBut it’s not just in the member states that much has happened as a result of the crisis. In theeuro area, much has changed for the better in institutional terms as well.One positive development is the ESM – a permanent euro rescue facility that can grantconditional financial aid to member states in the event of a crisis and can thus prevent a nationalcrisis from jeopardising the stability of the entire euro area financial system.The creation of the banking union is also a welcome development. Thus far, the banking unionencompasses a single supervisory mechanism, a single resolution mechanism, and harmonisednational deposit guarantee schemes.These reforms remedied weaknesses in the structure of the monetary union that were either 2 / 8BIS central bankers' speeches
ignored or overlooked when the euro was founded.The most experienced among you may remember that the idea of a joint financial supervisorysystem was actually discussed by the Delors Committee back at the end of the 1980s, but wasultimately dismissed.The crisis set in motion a learning process in this field, too, in which old beliefs were called intoquestion, and not only in the member states. This, by the way, also applies to the Bundesbank,which, for example, had long been sceptical of a common financial supervision.The ESM and the banking union, together with stricter financial regulation, have doubtless madethe monetary union more stable. If there were new upheavals in the financial system or inindividual member states, we would be considerably better prepared to deal with them today thanwe were in 2010, when the Greek debt crisis caught the euro area off guard.4 Further reforms4.1 GuidelinesMuch has been achieved in the member states and at the European level. But this still isn’tenough to crisis-proof the euro area once and for all. The financial market turbulence last weekwith regard to Italy is a case in point.The consensus is that the previous reforms have been insufficient to put the euro area on assound a footing as we would all like. Meanwhile, the economic environment at the moment is stillexceptionally favourable overall, and we should be taking advantage of this.So I am concerned by the fact that enthusiasm for consolidation in the euro area appears to havewaned. Whilst almost all euro area countries reduced their structural deficit by half a percent ofGDP or more in 2012, not a single one is set to improve its structural budget balance in 2018. Itseems that the reformed fiscal rules are having just as weak an impact as the old rules.Furthermore, the ECB Governing Council has emphasised again and again that theimplementation of structural reforms in the euro area needs to be significantly intensified now inparticular, in view of the current favourable economic environment, in order for economies tobecome more resilient and structural unemployment to fall further should they face strongerheadwinds – and by structural unemployment I mean the unemployment that remains even whenthe economy is doing well. This also needs to be the case if we want productivity and potentialgrowth in the euro area to rise.At around 1½ %, potential growth in the euro area has recovered since the crisis, but it is stillconsiderably lower than its pre-crisis level of about 2 %.In this context, there is currently passionate debate about national sovereignty in some memberstates. In fact, it is national economic policymakers who are responsible for improving theconditions required for growth, employment and social cohesion – through a good educationsystem, efficient public administration, growth-friendly and fair taxation, and an appropriateinfrastructure, to name but a few examples.This is in the countries’ own national interests and, at the same time, is the best way in whicheach individual country can contribute to the stability of Europe. Europe needs to takeresponsibility as a community – only then will we truly be able to make progress with theEuropean project and also show the citizens of Europe that it creates prosperity.So while there are many pressing issues to be discussed and decided upon at the national level,an intensive reform discussion is also taking place with regard to the future structure of themonetary union and the EU. This topic, as you all know, is also on the agenda of the EU summit 3 / 8BIS central bankers' speeches
at the end of this month here in Brussels.The ideas voiced by the French president Emmanuel Macron, which have been greeted with amix of goodwill and scepticism in Germany, have provided important impetus for the Europeandebate. Furthermore – and this is, I believe, a great achievement – he has created a convincing,lively narrative for the joint European project that citizens can buy into and even be enthusiasticabout.It seems clear to me that there will only be progress in this debate if Germany and France workin concert and move in the same direction.The Bundesbank has also been providing proposals of its own in this debate for a long time now,and it is within this debate that the agenda for the stability of the single currency is being set.From my perspective, three guidelines form the basis of these proposals.1. The European Union should focus more of its attention and spending on tasks that createadded value for the citizens of Europe.2. The institutional and economic conditions of the monetary union need to be set up in such away that the Eurosystem can properly fulfil its mandate and does not have to intervene on aregular basis as a crisis response unit.3. A stable monetary union requires both solidarity and solidity, and it is essential that thealignment of actions and liability be maintained.Allow me, if you will, to delve slightly deeper into this last point in particular.The alignment of actions and liability means that the authority to make decisions needs to belinked to the responsibility for the consequences of such decisions. Or, in other words, only hewho has the power to influence decisions is also prepared to bear the risks that these decisionsentail.When it was decided in Maastricht to create an economic and monetary union, the memberstates agreed to pool their sovereignty in monetary matters at the European level. However,under the existing regulatory framework, responsibility for fiscal policy – as for general economicpolicy – lies with the individual member states, as I have already mentioned.From the outset, there have been measures in place designed to prevent unsound publicfinances from jeopardising the stability of the single currency. Rules on debt have been laid downin the Stability and Growth Pact; it is prohibited to simply print more money as a way of financingthe public sector; and countries cannot take on each other’s liabilities – the famous no bail-outclause.In principle, though, the member states remain sovereign in fiscal matters. And indeed, thissovereignty is something that they have always confidently championed and defended. In thisvein, I recall Matteo Renzi, the former Italian Prime Minister once asserting that “It’s up to us todecide what taxes we cut, not some Eurocrat sitting in Brussels”.If monetary union reforms were to include a far greater degree of fiscal risk-sharing, actions andliability would only remain aligned if certain sovereignty rights were to be transferred to theEuropean level. Otherwise we would end up with imbalances and dubious incentives.But ceding a significant portion of their sovereignty to Brussels is precisely what the euro areamember states are not prepared to do – to give a European finance minister the right to intervenein national budgetary planning if they fail to comply with the fiscal rules, for instance.It seems to me that it’s already hard enough at times to ensure that the Commission’s existing 4 / 8BIS central bankers' speeches
powers are enforced and respected. And that’s why I’m convinced that any reform steps need tofit within the existing Maastricht framework.4.2 Risk sharing and provisioningBut complying with the Maastricht framework doesn’t necessarily rule out an expansion of mutualliability. If actions are properly aligned with liability, risk sharing can make a lot of sense.In principle, there are justifiable arguments in favour of having the collective resources of theESM function as a fiscal safety net for the European Single Resolution Fund, as per theCommission’s suggestion. After all, we already have banking supervision at the European level,meaning that we share the responsibility for supervisory decisions.For similar reasons, the Bundesbank isn’t opposed to a common European deposit insurancescheme per se. Quite the contrary. Such a scheme would, without doubt, contribute to a morestable financial system, as it would reduce the risk of bank runs. And shared supervisoryresponsibility makes a good case for joint liability here, too.But to protect the link between actions and liability, risks that have arisen under nationalresponsibility must be reduced before a common deposit insurance scheme is created. What’smore, the impact of national policy decisions on the quality of bank balance sheets must belimited.The stocks of non-performing loans on countries’ bank balance sheets – some of which are veryhigh – are an example of this kind of legacy risk. The average non-performing loan ratio has fallenby around one-third in Europe since 2014. But in some countries it remains very high and wellabove pre-crisis levels.The large holdings of government bonds on bank balance sheets are also problematic. Owing toa regulatory loophole, government bonds are backed by little to no capital. And – unlike withprivate borrowers – there is no cap on individual banks’ exposures to sovereign debtors.Before a deposit insurance scheme can be created, these sovereign default risks on banks’balance sheets would need to be reduced in the long term, as would stocks of non-performingloans. Otherwise the insurance scheme would find itself assuming liability for them.My colleague on the ECB Governing Council, Benoît Cœuré, rightly pointed out the other day that“A deposit insurance scheme should be seen as an insurance against economic risks, just asyou take out liability insurance to protect yourself against the risk of an accident.” But as you allknow, ladies and gentlemen, you can only take out a liability insurance policy to cover futureaccidents, and not if the damage has already been done.Following the logic of an insurance scheme, and given that member states will still have abearing on the health of their banks in future, the concept of a permanent national risk retentionrequirement also seems worth considering. Think, for example, of insolvency law and how it islegally enforced.If we look further afield, beyond the banking union, a rainy day fund modelled on the type in placein several US states is certainly worthy of consideration. Many states put aside budget surplusesfor hard times. But new scope for borrowing and fund transfers between states are incompatiblewith this approach.However, it is reasonable to question whether countries with solid public finances even needsuch a fund. After all, European fiscal rules are less strict when it comes to government debtthan the constitutions of the US states, most of which prohibit new borrowing altogether.But such an instrument would at least offer greater room for manoeuvre in difficult situations 5 / 8BIS central bankers' speeches
without needing to expand fiscal risk sharing or requiring cross-border payments.4.3 Private risk sharingIncreased risk sharing within the euro area would make member states better able to absorbeconomic shocks. The same goes, in particular, for private forms of risk sharing.A recent article by ECB economists shows that, in the euro area, when a particular memberstate experiences an economic slump, 80 % of that downturn bleeds through to consumption inthat country. Now, at first, it might seem plausible to us that it is chiefly the people in the affectedcountry that have to tighten their belts.But in the US states, 40 % – at most – of a shock to GDP is reflected in a fall in consumptiongrowth. So there’s clearly another way. The rest of the impact is absorbed elsewhere. Forinstance, because the losses sustained by an enterprise in one US state are distributed acrossthe whole country as shareholders are often domiciled in other states.[1]  The much greater importance of private risk sharing in the United States shows that private risksharing is capable of enhancing the individual countries’ resilience in the euro area, too.Integrated and efficient financial markets are a key prerequisite for this.Creating a capital markets union, as proposed in 2015 by the Commission, would move Europea long way towards achieving this aim. Which is why the Bundesbank explicitly endorses theproject.It has the potential to spur economic growth, dismantle barriers to cross-border investment,diversify corporate financing and strengthen private risk sharing. And it would also be a keycontribution to making the euro area more stable.The more successful efforts to strengthen cross-border equity financing are, the greater thesums the capital markets union could be expected to contribute to strengthening private risksharing. After all, there is one key difference between equity and borrowed funds: equity investorsparticipate directly in economic risk and in gains and losses. Creditors, on the other hand, are notexposed to losses – except in the case of insolvency.Equity therefore provides better opportunities for sharing risks and opportunities. However, thereare incentives for firms to obtain funding through debt rather than equity. In many countries, forinstance, debt interest is tax-deductible, but the cost of equity isn’t.To that extent, the efforts being made to create a common assessment basis for corporation taxrepresent a good opportunity to reduce the preferential tax treatment being given to debt and tomake equity financing more attractive.5 Focusing the EULadies and gentlemenThe euro area can only be strong as part of a strong European Union.What this requires – and that will be my last item for today – is for the EU to focus more single-mindedly on those tasks in which it has a comparative advantage and the benefits of which it cansell convincingly to the public – that is, tasks that clearly have European added value.There are tasks that can be performed better at the European level than the national. From aneconomic standpoint, these might include Europe-wide public goods and therefore policy areaswith cross-border externalities, in particular. 6 / 8BIS central bankers' speeches
As we know, public goods are defined as goods that individuals cannot be excluded from using,the use of which does not reduce the amount available to someone else. Because these traitsare an open door to free ridership, these services have to be provided by the government sector.The use of European public goods is scattered far beyond national borders. These tasks shouldthen be relocated to the European level.French President Emmanuel Macron has listed as such tasks defence, the protection of externalborders, migration policy, climate protection and the expansion of digital networks. All of whichare fields in which there is visible European added value. And if you read the interview withChancellor Merkel at the weekend, you will know that she expressed similar views.That is why it would be appropriate to add the topics of border security and migration to theEuropean agenda without delay. This would also help individual member states to feel lessdisadvantaged and abandoned on account of their geographical location.At the same time, however, the principle of subsidiarity enshrined in the EU Treaty needs to beapplied more effectively, as there are tasks that are still more at home at the domestic level. Andthat is why it is a welcome development that Commission President Juncker has convened atask force for subsidiarity and asked it to consider which powers are better exercised nationallyor locally than at the European level.This task force, headed by the First Vice-President Frans Timmermans, has been given untilmid-July to submit a report. This report should also present ways of better incorporating regionaland local government in EU policy-making – an idea which is surely being followed with greatinterest here at the Representation of the State of Hesse.More Europe does not necessarily have to mean more money for Europe. I am thinking, forinstance, of the establishment of a single market for services and a common digital market inEurope. These are projects that do not necessarily cost much but which deliver a lot. Studiesshow that they could achieve growth effects twice the size of those provided by the creation ofthe single market for goods.However, it is clear that providing European public goods generally comes with a price tagattached.Germany – unlike other net contributors – has already declared its willingness to put moretowards the EU budget.Europe first needs to define the tasks that it would make sense to accomplish jointly and thatshould therefore also be funded jointly instead of starting off by talking about money, and thusputting the cart before the horse. So it should be less about how much each party pays andreceives and more about figuring out how to invest the funds wisely. 6 ConclusionLadies and gentlemenAs early as five years ago, then-Federal President Joachim Gauck, in my estimation, put hisfinger on the essence of the debate on European policy reform when he said that “This unioninvolves give and take; it must not be a one-way street for anyone. It is based on the principle ofreciprocity, equality and mutual commitment. More Europe must mean: more reliability. Reliabilityand solidarity will rise and fall together.”There is virtually nothing to add to that. And I therefore thank you for your attention. 7 / 8BIS central bankers' speeches

Erkki Liikanen: Economics and economic policySpeech by Mr Erkki Liikanen, Governor of the Bank of Finland, Helsinki, 10 April 2018.*   *   *The central bank is an organisation of public servants. Public service bodies obtain theiressential mandate from elected bodies.Within the Eurosystem, the central banks and their governing bodies have been given a definitemandate, including independence in monetary policy issues. In recent years, central banks havealso been assigned new responsibilities in the field of macroprudential policy.As part of the Eurosystem, the Bank of Finland participates in monetary policy decision-makingand implementation. The Bank also has a role to play as part of the Banking Union.How then should the central bank participate in domestic discourse on economics and economicpolicy formation? The Bank of Finland’s statements relating to domestic economic policy arebased on objectives set for the Bank and the Eurosystem. According to the Act on the Bank ofFinland and the EU Treaties the primary objective is price stability. Without prejudice to thisobjective, the Bank also supports the achievement of other EU economic policy objectives, suchas balanced economic growth.The Bank of Finland participates in economic discourse in Finland primarily at those stages ofpreparation and decision-making that are consistent with the Bank’s expertise derived fromresearch, international experience, or other publicly justified economic analysis.There are two such stages: first, identification of the problems related to the current state of theeconomy; second, assessment of the potential effects of the alternatives for action.At the same time, we should bear in mind that decisions on individual items of public spending orrevenue often involve such value judgements as a central bank should refrain from making.In the past decade, there was a lively debate in the United States on whether Federal ReserveChairman Alan Greenspan went too far in supporting President George W. Bush’s tax reforms.At the Central Bank Symposium in Jackson Hole in Wyoming in 2005, professors Alan Blinderand Ricardo Reis emphasised that it is highly questionable whether central banks should voiceopinions on issues of economic policy outside of the realm of monetary policy. The generalopinion of the meeting was that central banks should refrain from making value-basedstatements, in particular. But it is an entirely different matter if economic policy jeopardises theconditions for price stability or causes disruption on the financial markets.Example from recent years: the structural problems of the Finnish economyA role that comes naturally to the central bank in domestic economic discourse is to paint apicture of the state of the economy. A balanced picture of the state of macroeconomicdevelopments based on careful analysis serves as an important basis for successful economicpolicy.In step with the escalation of the global financial crisis in 2008, economic performancedeteriorated across the advanced economies, including Finland. A few years after the onset ofthe crisis, economic growth had already gotten underway in many countries. However, inFinland, the weak performance of the economy turned out to be more protracted, despite theexpansionary fiscal measures adopted to support the economy.Realising this took some time in Finland. We had to acknowledge that Finland’s economic 1 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
difficulties were not short-term and transient problems of the global economic cycle but were of alonger-lasting nature. This debate was launched in spring 2013, largely at the initiative of theBank of Finland.Finland did not encounter a domestic financial crisis during the global financial crisis; the Finnishfinancial system remained fully operational. The cost and availability of bank loans did notconstitute an obstacle to economic growth, nor did the costs of Finnish government borrowingrise.Finland’s economic hardship was caused by a number of setbacks. Mobile phone manufactureand the related huge inflows of revenue were exhausted. Demand for printing paper decreased inEurope, the forest industry was subject to restructuring and export volumes declined. Althoughlargely unrelated to the global financial crisis, these problems hitting Finnish exports coincidedwith the crisis.Export conditions were also subdued by the increase in the level of costs, which was faster thanfor Finland’s trading partners. Just before the outbreak of the global financial crisis, collectivebargaining agreements spanning over two years and providing for sizeable wage rises had beenconcluded in Finland. These were introduced at the same time as many other countries startedto adopt cost moderation in response to the economic recession. Finland suffered a major lossof cost-competitiveness.An additional factor behind the deteriorating conditions for economic growth in Finland was thereduction in the size of the working-age population. The turnaround occurred in 2010, when themembers of the baby-boom generation, in large numbers, began to reach retirement age.The established methods for capturing fluctuations in macroeconomic developments could partlyhave led policymakers astray, as the cyclical fluctuations witnessed were not of a standardnature; they also reflected profound structural changes. The global economic debate, as such,did also not deliver any comprehensive tools for understanding economic developments inFinland, as Finland’s economic hardship was different in character to the problems encounteredby many other countries in the wake of the financial crisis. In fact, the Finnish financial sector andthe Finnish government’s credit rating were not exposed to any disruptions or downgrades.The most common indicators employed to analyse cost-competitiveness were no longeradequate due to the developments in the terms of trade. The deterioration in Finland’s terms oftrade was exceptionally strong due to the fall in export prices.As regards the means available to improve cost-competitiveness, it was necessary to recognizethat the usual measures of wage moderation did not bring about any improvements in thesituation, given that the increase in wages and prices was exceptionally slow elsewhere, too.Despite the very subdued increase in wages witnessed in Finland after 2009 compared withprevious years, this did not differ much from wage developments in other advanced economies.As the slowdown in economic activity was not cyclical and short-term in nature, it resulted in adeterioration in the long-term fiscal outlook. Not only had the fiscal deficit begun to growimmediately upon the onset of the global financial crisis; a large fiscal sustainability gap had alsoemerged.Hence, Finland faced a need to consolidate the public finances, improve the long-term outlook forboth economic growth and the public finances, and to adopt swift measures to enhance cost-competitiveness. Awareness of the crucial importance of these economic policy objectivescalled for an understanding of the current state of the economy. The Bank of Finland presentedits assessments based on these considerations to the social partners in early summer 2013.In recent years, important decisions have been taken in Finland to enhance cost-competitiveness 2 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
and improve long-term fiscal sustainability, and to adopt fiscal consolidation measures.Decisions have been taken on a competitiveness pact and pension reform and onfiscal consolidation measures. This has called for a broad consensus on the current state of theeconomy among the political parties and the social partners. The Bank of Finland also later madeits analyses available to decision-makers, for use as a basis of decisions. The analysisconducted in 2015 on cost competitiveness played a crucial role for the decisions taken in recentyears.What is the input of economics in economic policy in general?In autumn 2017, a significant contribution was brought to the discussion by Nobel laureate JeanTirole.When Tirole won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2014, he became a well-known figure. Tirolehas told how he suddenly found himself being stopped in the street by people who wanted toknow what economic research is and how it can foster well-being. People were asking whethereconomics could resolve the great challenges of our times.The questions presented to Tirole present an important challenge to the economist communityas a whole. Economists need to produce a comprehensive and thorough analysis of the keyeconomic policy problems, but they also need to share the results of their analysis in an easilyreadable form for the intelligent reader who lacks an education in economics.Jean Tirole turned his reflections into a non-technical book entitled ‘Economics for the CommonGood’. In his book, Tirole emphasises that economics is a science of the means, not of the aims.Political objectives incorporate values, and setting these objectives is the task of those mandatedto do so by democratic elections. Economics, in turn, can provide an input when the goal is tofind tools for meeting the objectives at the lowest possible cost.The market and the stateOne of the key issues of economics is the role of the market. As Tirole emphasises in his book,the market is an instrument for economists, not an end itself. The market cannot always functionwithout failures. This happens, for example, when buyers have insufficient information aboutproducts or when consumers only think about their immediate gratification or make decisionswhich, over time, involve higher costs than their payment capacity. Market failures also occur ifan economic actor has too much market power.If the market functions properly it can improve efficiency, but there is no reason to assume that itwill deliver equity. This is why both the state and the market are needed. They arecomplementary – not substitutes for one another. The state cannot ensure a decent life for itscitizens without a market. The market, in turn, needs the state to guarantee that the legal systemoperates smoothly and that market flaws and failures are addressed.Increasing competition through regulatory decisions has brought considerable advantages toconsumers. One example: during my term in the European Commission, we drew on JeanTirole’s research and expertise when we proposed the unbundling of the local loop in 2000, thusopening up broadband services to competition. Broadband prices declined rapidly and mosthouseholds gained access to broadband. This was an important step in the development of theinformation society.Tirole writes a lot about incentives. Incentives affect the behaviour of firms and individuals.However, a financial incentive does not always lead to the intended results. As an example, Tirolerefers to blood donation: when people started to get a financial reward from donating blood, thenumber of donors plummeted. Donors were not motivated by money but by the possibility to 3 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
contribute to the common good.As the example shows, policy measures can have unintended consequences. This poses achallenge, because economic models used as an aid in analysis are always simplifications –otherwise they would not be usable. And analyses may not always reveal all the side effects.In academic literature, peer reviewers often ask researchers to expand their models by changingthe underlying assumptions and testing the robustness of the analysis under different conditions.This is time-consuming and prolongs the publication process. And yet it is necessary for qualitycontrol when the purpose is to find as universal regularities as possible. In empirical research,the corresponding requirement means, for example, the use of alternative data or estimationmethods.Alternative analyses can remain without the attention and impact they deserve if views on thebenefits of the prevailing course of action are too cemented.Example: predicting the financial crisisA famous example of this is the discussion held at the Jackson Hole symposium in 2005 when Ihad just begun my second year as governor of the Bank of Finland. That year’s theme atJackson Hole was the appraisal of Alan Greenspan’s era as chairman of the Federal Reserve.At the conference, Professor Raghuram Rajan, then director of research at the IMF, spoke onthe topic ‘Has financial development made the world riskier?’[1] Contrary to the accepted wisdomof the day, Rajan answered three times in the positive: yes, it has made it riskier.Rajan noted how securitisation, markets for transferring risk and bad incentives were leading to adangerous accumulation of risks in the global financial system. He was also worried aboutliquidity. There follows a quote from Rajan’s speech and I have also cited it on some previousoccasions, as it truly is worth reiterating:‘If banks also face credit losses and there is uncertainty about where those losses are located,only the very few unimpeachable banks will receive the supply of liquidity fleeing other markets. Ifthese banks also lose confidence in their liquidity-short brethren, the inter-bank market couldfreeze up, and one could well have a full-blown financial crisis.’Now this is exactly what happened three years later after the failure of Lehman Brothers. Nextautumn will mark the passing of 10 years since that event.The response from many in the audience was very hostile. Rajan was seen as a spoiler at theparty and an opponent of innovation and progress. His proposals for reform were called ‘non-starters’.At that time, the policy community was not in a mood to change course just because of oneconference presentation, even if it was a balanced and well thought-out contribution. It took amajor international disaster for the policy community and the majority of academic opinion toadjust its view.Rajan’s speech was a great example of not only professional competence, but also ofprofessional integrity and even courage.Economics and climate changeWhen we examine the major societal issues of our time that also have a strong impact on theeconomy, we cannot ignore climate change.Climate change has been described as the largest global market failure, which is due to the fact 4 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
that a price has not been established for greenhouse gas emissions. The future of our climate issubject to a considerable degree of uncertainty, but in the scientific community there is broadconsensus on the basic issues: climate change is a fact, it is accelerating and it is a human-induced phenomenon.There are many unresolved and difficult issues in the area of climate policy, but in economicsthere is a fairly broad consensus on the principles for solving the problem. These principles arediscussed also by Jean Tirole in his book ‘Economics for the Common Good’. Climate policyshould be effective and equitable. The system should be constructed so that all countries havean incentive to participate in the combat against climate change.First, I will discuss the issue of effectiveness. Climate change is a global problem that requiresglobal solutions. One global price should be established for greenhouse gas emissions becausethe impact of greenhouse gas emissions on global warming is the same irrespective of where inthe world or in which field of production they are created.Various country-, region- or industry-specific unilateral solutions may have unwanted effects. Forexample, if a country introduces a stricter climate policy, it may provide companies an incentivefor relocating greenhouse gas-emitting production to countries with a laxer climate policy. Due tothis phenomenon – known as carbon leakage – global greenhouse gas emissions would notnecessarily decrease.On the other hand, as a result of subsidies on renewable energy, for example, other forms oflow-emission power generation may be replaced. If the price of energy declines due to subsidies,companies may shut down low-emission power generation plants, and in addition to renewableforms of energy, we may be left with power generation that is low-cost but high-emissions.Professor Matti Liski has presented interesting views from this perspective.A common global climate policy would create effective incentives for developing low-emissiontechnology.Another key issue in the combat against climate change is equity. The reduction of greenhouseemissions involves costs, and poor countries do not necessarily have sufficient resources orinterest to participate. Moreover, advanced economies are responsible for the majority ofhistorical greenhouse gas emissions. If one global price is established for emissions, we wouldprobably need some type of a global system of compensation for poorer countries.The key is not to try to resolve the issue of effectiveness and equity of climate policy with a singletool, i.e. country-specific emission targets or country-specific pricing mechanisms. This wouldeasily lead to unwanted effects, such as carbon leakage.Another key question is how to create incentives for governments to participate in the combatagainst climate change. The problem is due to the fact that the benefits of climate policy areglobal, while the costs of reducing greenhouse emissions are usually country-specific or local.The incentives for free-riding are obvious. To support climate policy, we need global supervisionwith sufficiently strong powers. Climate policy-related compensation systems could be part ofthe incentives.On the need to develop economics competence and teaching in FinlandThe examples that I have discussed today show that economics, together with other sciences,can play an important role in resolving key social issues. It is therefore essential that economicresearch and education have at their disposal sufficient resources, in terms of both quality andquantity.The University of Helsinki, Aalto University and Hanken School of Economics have established 5 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
the Helsinki Graduate School of Economics, a graduate school and research unit for economics.The objective is to meet the growing demand for economics competence and teaching inFinland. The Bank of Finland, together with the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Educationand Culture, support the establishment of the unit and have expressed their preparedness toprovide resources for its operation.The aim of this project is to create in Finland a globally significant research and teaching unit foreconomics. The doctoral programmes of the Helsinki Graduate School of Economics will coverall the key areas of economics. The unit is also responsible for providing a setting for Master’sdegree programmes for students at the Aalto University, the University of Helsinki and HankenSchool of Economics. The new unit will also be responsible for coordinating the establishment ofprofessorships in the field of economics and the recruitment of economics professors in theuniversities that are part of the Graduate School.The unit will be a centre for economics and other quantitative social sciences. It will alsocooperate with external stakeholder groups, for example economics researchers and students,as well as researchers and students of the other social sciences at universities located outsidethe Greater Helsinki area. The various branches of social sciences have many joint interests,and therefore we may witness an increase in research interaction in future.The sub-disciplines of economics that are in need of reinforcement are macroeconomics, publiceconomics, applied micro-economics and data-based decision-making. These producecompetence and research-based knowledge in key policy areas, such as monetary, financial andEU policies, social and health-care policy, competition policy and pension-related issues.The input of researchers is also needed in the planning of markets and the impact assessmentof policy measures in various fields. Industrial organisation and structural models can provide thenecessary tools for analysis. A deep understanding of economic growth – ultimately productivitygrowth – is also of key importance.We must also consider what constitutes the optimal amount of resources to be allocated, on onehand, to research communities that produce the critical mass and that have already beenestablished in Finland in some sub-disciplines of economics, and, on the other hand, to ensure asufficient degree of multidisciplinary research.In conclusionEconomics has produced a number of tools for finding the best solutions. Economists play animportant role in societal debate by contributing to the discussion the results of economicsresearch and also by informing on the disagreements and interpretational differences in the fieldof research. This is not only their right but also their responsibility.[1] Rajan, R. (2005): Has financial development made the world riskier?

Anita Angelovska-Bezoska: Workshop on fintech - opening remarksOpening remarks by Ms Anita Angelovska-Bezoska, Governor of the National Bank of theRepublic of Macedonia, at the NBRM Workshop on Fintech, Skopje, 28 May 2018.*   *   *Dear Mr. Jay Tikam,Dear colleagues,It is my great pleasure to open the NBRM workshop on a topic that has been attracting a risinginterest by regulators, supervisors and central bankers, i.e. a workshop on fIntech organizationsthat, by combining new business models and innovative technology, gradually change the shapeof the financial services segment. The main idea of this workshop is to become betteracquainted with this rather new but very important topic. It has been organized with the support ofthe European Fund for Southeast Europe, for which we are thankful.Although in continental Europe, fintech companies account for just a small share of the marketsfor banking, payment services and asset management, still they are on the rise as they arerapidly entering the markets and competing with banks. According to Ernst&Young’s FintechAdoption Index, one-third of the consumers utilize at least two or more fintech services and theyare increasingly aware of FinTech as part of their day-to-day activities. The FinTech AdoptionIndex for services offered by fintech organizations, divided into five broad categories – moneytransfers and payment services, financial planning tools, savings and investments, borrowingand insurance, indicates that money transfers and payment services are continuing to lead thefintech charge with adoption standing at 50% in 2017 and 88% of consumers anticipating ofdoing so in the future.This rapid rise in fintech organizations has posed many dilemmas: What are the benefits thatfintechs bring to the society, on the one hand, and what are the risks that they create, on theother? Is it the end of banking or are banks going to team up with the newcomers? One of themain concerns in this regard is that while fintech companies increase financial inclusion,facilitate the access to finance and lead to more competitive markets, they can also beconducive to cutting costs and rising risks in the traditional banking segment.  Against this background, the FinTech topic has received an increasing attention in the centralbanking community, including our central bank. We have been closely monitoring the fintechdevelopments, evaluating the benefits and risks that they bring and trying to strike a right balancegiven the local context. An important step in this direction is the draft law on payments that isexpected to provide impulse for new companies with innovative, but safe financial services.This workshop is conceived as a platform for getting better insight in the fintech developments,exchanging opinions, sharing ideas with a view of drawing the outlines of our future FinTechStrategy. In this light, I am delighted to invite Mr. Tikam to share with us part of his richexperience and knowledge on this topic. Mr. Tikam is an experienced Executive Level Advisorwith 26 years commercial experience, having played multifaceted roles, with the last 22 years infinancial services.  Having in mind Mr. Tikam’s proficiency, I have no doubts that today we willhave fruitful discussions and valuable exchange of experiences to the benefit of all participants.   Mr. Tikam, thank you for your efforts in making this workshop happen. The floor is yours. 1 / 1BIS central bankers' speeches
 Japan's Economy and Monetary Policy Speech at a Meeting with Business Leaders in Osaka Bank of Japan September 25, 2018 Haruhiko Kuroda Governor of the Bank of Japan (English translation based on the Japanese original) 
1  Introduction It is my great pleasure to have the opportunity today to exchange views with a distinguished gathering of business leaders in the Kansai region. I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincerest gratitude for your cooperation with the various activities of the Bank of Japan's branches in Osaka, Kobe, and Kyoto.  In my speech today, I would like to first talk about the Bank's view on the recent developments in economic activity and prices, and then explain its thinking behind the conduct of monetary policy.  I. Economic Developments Let me start by talking about economic developments. Japan's economy is expanding moderately, with a virtuous cycle from income to spending being maintained in both the corporate and household sectors. Although the real GDP growth rate for the January-March quarter temporarily marked negative growth, due mainly to irregular weather, after continuing to register positive growth for eight consecutive quarters, the rate for the April-June quarter showed a return to firm growth, representing 3.0 percent on an annualized basis (Chart 1).  The long-lasting recovery of Japan's economy is likely to be mainly attributable to both external and domestic demand increasing in a well-balanced manner. As for external demand, exports have continued on an increasing trend, exceeding the peak before the global financial crisis, led mainly by those of capital goods and IT-related goods, in which Japan has a comparative advantage (Chart 2). Looking at the underlying developments in overseas economies in detail, the U.S. economy has continued to expand firmly, with the growth rate for the April-June quarter registering 4 percent on an annualized basis. Firms' sentiment has continued to improve in both the manufacturing and nonmanufacturing sectors, and there has been positive momentum in private consumption on the back of the favorable employment and income situation. Meanwhile, the European economy has continued to recover on the whole with business fixed investment and private consumption following an uptrend; however, exports recently have decelerated somewhat, due mainly to the effects of the appreciation of the euro. As for emerging economies, the Chinese 
2  economy has continued to see stable growth on the whole with private investment and consumption remaining firm, although growth in infrastructure investment has decelerated somewhat. Other emerging economies, mainly Asian economies, have been recovering moderately, reflecting in part an increase in exports and the effects of their economic stimulus measures. Thus, while the momentum of economic recovery differs to some extent across countries and regions, the Bank judges that overseas economies have continued to grow firmly on the whole.  Turning to the domestic situation, in the corporate sector, the profit environment has remained favorable, with the ratio of current profits to sales having been at a record high level (Chart 3). Under these circumstances, according to the Bank's June Tankan (Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan), firms' business fixed investment plans for fiscal 2018 showed the highest growth for this time of the year since the survey started. In the manufacturing sector, there has been a notable increase in research and development investment with a view to advancing next-generation technology such as self-driving systems and large-capacity batteries, in addition to investment intended for capacity expansion on the back of firm domestic and external demand. In the nonmanufacturing sector, investment aimed at improving efficiency and saving labor in order to deal with the recent labor shortage has maintained its high growth. Such improvement in the corporate sector has had positive effects on the household sector. In the labor market, the active job openings-to-applicants ratio is currently 1.63, the high level last seen during the period of high economic growth, and the unemployment rate has declined to around 2.5 percent, the level observed during the bubble period (Chart 4). While the number of employees has registered a year-on-year growth rate of around 2 percent, total cash earnings per employee have risen moderately but steadily, led mainly by those of part-time employees. Against the background of such improvement in the employment and income situation, private consumption has been increasing moderately, albeit with fluctuations.  In terms of the contribution to economic growth, the recent increase in demand from foreign visitors cannot be ignored. Sales of duty free goods at department stores in the first half of this year registered an annual increase of close to 50 percent, and the occupancy rates of city hotels have maintained the high level of almost 80 percent for the past few years. On 
3  this point, as big events such as the Rugby World Cup and the G-20 summit are scheduled to be held in Osaka next year, I hear that the construction of new hotels and rebuilding of existing facilities have been taking place successively. As for the typhoon at the beginning of September, the Bank will make efforts to firmly grasp the impact of the damage caused, and expects that both the public and private sectors will work together to overcome the disaster and create regions that are even stronger and more attractive.  So far, I have explained that Japan's economy has been improving, led by external and domestic demand in a well-balanced manner. With regard to the outlook, the economy is likely to continue its moderate expansion. However, there are various risks to this baseline scenario, and uncertainties regarding overseas economies in particular warrant attention. For example, it is necessary to thoroughly examine the extent to which recent protectionist moves, such as the trade friction between the United States and China, will affect trade as well as firms' investment activities. There have been active discussions over this issue at international conferences that I have taken part in, including the G-20 and G-7 meetings. In addition, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently released a simulation analysis of the effects of protectionist moves on the global economy. According to the simulation, downward pressure on the global economy stemming from stagnation in trade activity itself is likely to be 0.1 percentage point at most in the next five years. However, if such protectionist moves bring about turmoil in global financial markets and deterioration in firms' sentiment, downward pressure on the global economy is expected to be around 0.5 percentage point at most. Global economies have become more interdependent than ever before, with the recent progress in globalization and information technology. In this situation, it is clear that protectionist policies will not benefit any economy, regardless of whether it adopts such policies. Therefore, while a brake is expected to be put on excessive protectionist moves at some point, it is essential to continue global discussion to ensure this and to make sure that protectionist moves will not create instability in financial markets and firms' sentiment.  Moreover, attention also should be paid to the effects that moves toward monetary policy normalization, including the policy rate hikes in the United States, will have on global capital flows and emerging economies. In fact, some emerging economies such as Turkey 
4  and Argentina -- where there are vulnerabilities in the economy including twin deficits and high inflation -- are confronted with a significant depreciation of their currencies, as the inflow of dollar-based capital into these economies has turned to an outflow. That said, the fundamentals of many other emerging economies including Asian economies have been firm, and the Federal Reserve seems to be conducting its policy by carefully taking account of developments in global financial markets and the global economy. Thus, it is fairly unlikely at this point that the problems happening in some emerging economies will spread widely. However, as sudden changes could arise in the market, we will continue to carefully examine developments in global financial markets and emerging economies.  II. Price Developments Now I will move on to price developments. Prices have continued to show relatively weak developments compared to the economic expansion and the labor market tightening, and the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI) excluding fresh food and energy prices has been in the range of 0.0-0.5 percent (Chart 5). After five years, Japan's economy is no longer in deflation, in the sense of a sustained decline in prices, but the Bank's price stability target of 2 percent inflation on an annual basis has not yet been achieved. For this reason, in the Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (Outlook Report) released at the end of July, the Bank focused on examining the reasons for these sluggish price developments and updated the outlook for economic activity and prices. Today, I would like to outline some key points of the report.  The first point is the reason why prices have been sluggish even though the economy has improved steadily. Basically, this is likely to be mainly attributable to the experience of prolonged low growth and deflation. The long and severe adjustment phase since the second half of the 1990s, including the financial crisis, brought about sluggishness in economic activity and asset prices. Under these circumstances, firms' wage- and price-setting stance as well as households' views toward price rises have become cautious. The Bank introduced quantitative and qualitative monetary easing (QQE) in 2013 and has been persistently conducting powerful monetary easing. However, as the mindset and behavior based on the assumption that wages and prices will not increase easily have become embedded in the economy over a long period of time, it has been taking time for the situation to change. 
5  In addition to such basic factors, the large room to raise productivity, mainly in the nonmanufacturing sector, as well as the technological progress such as digitalization in recent years, have allowed firms to maintain their cautious stance toward raising prices despite an increase in labor costs. For instance, many firms in the accommodations as well as eating and drinking services sectors have been compensating for a rise in personnel expenses by introducing online reservation and ordering systems using tablet devices. In addition, a further increase in labor participation by women and seniors in the past few years has eased labor shortage in part, serving as a factor slowing the pace of wage increases. In the long term, such moves are likely to strengthen the economy's growth potential and make firms' and households' spending activities more active, thereby contributing to pushing up prices. At least in the short term, however, these moves will weaken upward pressure on wages and prices due to the reasons I mentioned earlier.  The second point concerning prices in Japan is that the mechanism for a rise in inflation itself is not lost, although its pace is sluggish. Moves to raise sales prices have been observed recently among a wide range of firms, reflecting rises in personnel expenses and prices of raw materials as well as components. Also, according to the Tankan, for the first time in about 10 years, the number of enterprises answering that the output prices have risen has been exceeding the number of those answering that such prices have fallen (Chart 6). Going forward, with the heightening perception of labor shortage, as wages of part-time employees continue to increase, its effects are likely to spread to wages of regular employees, mainly among small and medium-sized firms and the younger generations. In fact, at this year's annual spring labor-management wage negotiations, the rise in the rate of increase in base pay was more evident for small and medium-sized firms than for large firms, and summer bonuses increased more significantly than last year. Such moves are expected to ease consumers' cost-saving mentality and price rises by firms are likely to be more easily accepted accordingly.  In this way, as a high level of utilization of labor and capital, or an improved output gap, is sustained, many of the factors that have been delaying inflation -- such as firms' cautious wage- and price-setting stance as well as households' cautiousness toward price rises -- will likely be resolved gradually. When further price rises come to be observed widely as a result 
6  of this, people's medium- to long-term inflation expectations are projected to rise gradually. As a consequence, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to increase gradually toward the price stability target of 2 percent, although it will take more time than expected. In the July Outlook Report, the Bank projected that the year-on-year rates of change in the CPI (less fresh food) for fiscal 2018 through fiscal 2020 would likely be 1.1 percent, 1.5 percent, and 1.6 percent, respectively. We are in a difficult situation in terms of achieving 2 percent inflation by fiscal 2020. Nevertheless, maintaining a positive output gap -- a driver for a rise in inflation -- for a long time, which will firmly push up actual prices as well as inflation expectations, as I just mentioned, is likely to be the most certain path toward achieving 2 percent inflation.  III. The Bank's Conduct of Monetary Policy Lastly, I would like to talk about the Bank's thinking behind the conduct of monetary policy.  The Bank has been conducting powerful monetary easing under the framework of "QQE with Yield Curve Control," aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent (Chart 7). In terms of yield curve control, with a view to facilitating the formation of the yield curve that is considered most appropriate for achieving 2 percent inflation, the Bank has purchased Japanese government bonds (JGBs) under the guideline for market operations, in which it sets the short-term policy interest rate at minus 0.1 percent and the target level of 10-year JGB yields at around zero percent. Under the circumstances, not only JGB yields, but also lending rates for firms as well as issuance rates for corporate bonds have remained at extremely low levels, and the amount outstanding of bank lending has been increasing. In addition, the Bank has purchased exchange-traded funds (ETFs) so that their amount outstanding will increase at an annual pace of about 6 trillion yen, with a view to lowering risk premia in the stock market and exerting positive effects on economic activity and prices.  As I mentioned earlier, it is likely to take more time than expected to achieve 2 percent inflation. On the other hand, the mechanism whereby an improvement in the output gap leads to a rise in inflation has continued to operate. Considering such situation, the Bank judged it important to persistently continue with powerful monetary easing and decided at 
7  the July 2018 Monetary Policy Meeting (MPM) to strengthen the policy framework as follows (Chart 8).  First, the Bank introduced forward guidance for policy rates. Specifically, it publicly made clear to "maintain the current extremely low levels of short- and long-term interest rates for an extended period of time, taking into account uncertainties regarding economic activity and prices including the effects of the consumption tax hike scheduled to take place in October 2019." This is based on the recognition that, in a situation where achieving 2 percent inflation is taking time, simply stating that it will persistently continue with monetary easing cannot sufficiently ensure public confidence regarding its monetary policy. I hope the introduction of forward guidance makes clear the Bank's strong policy stance toward achieving the price stability target.  With regard to this forward guidance, some point out that it is difficult to understand how long "for an extended period of time" means. First of all, as the words imply, it is not based on a specific period of time. The phrase "for an extended period of time" was often used by other central banks, presumably implying a fairly long period of time. Partly because central banks in the United States and Europe are proceeding with monetary policy normalization recently, some market participants speculated that a policy rate hike would take place soon even in Japan. However, the situation regarding the price stability target in Japan differs substantially from that in the United States and Europe. In terms of clarifying this point, it is very important to make clear that the Bank will maintain the current extremely low levels of short- and long-term interest rates for an extended period of time.  Of course, "for an extended period of time" does not mean permanently. Such being the case, some may think that the period for which interest rate levels will be maintained should be linked to a specific period of time or price indicators, in order to ensure the effectiveness of the commitment. However, there are various uncertainties regarding economic activity and prices in Japan, as I mentioned earlier. Therefore, in designing forward guidance, we need to ensure not only the effectiveness of the commitment, but also the flexibility of the future policy conduct, and in a balanced manner. The same applies to forward guidance by other central banks. That is, in the initial stage following its introduction, as is the case in 
8  Japan, it is common to commit to maintaining interest rate levels while presenting qualitative conditions such as the economic situation and risk assessments, focusing rather on the flexibility of the policy conduct.  In addition to the introduction of forward guidance, the Bank decided at the July MPM to enhance the sustainability of "QQE with Yield Curve Control." In persistently continuing with monetary easing, it is necessary to make adjustments to the policy framework so that it can function in a competent manner over the period of the easing's duration. For example, while the current target level of 10-year JGB yields is around zero percent, as I mentioned earlier, the Bank made it clear that, under the target, the long-term yields might move upward and downward to some extent mainly depending on developments in economic activity and prices, thereby conducting market operations in a more flexible manner. Yield curve control is an essential measure in stabilizing interest rates in Japan at low levels. On the other hand, because it is powerful, interest rate formation in the JGB market has been somewhat rigid, and there has been a notable decline in transactions. It is considered that the measures decided at the July MPM will mitigate the side effects accompanying such powerful monetary easing while facilitating the formation of an appropriate yield curve, and as a consequence, lead to enhancing the sustainability of the policy. In addition, as for ETF purchases, from the same aspect of enhancing the sustainability of the policy, the Bank made it clear that it might increase or decrease the amount of purchases depending on market conditions, while maintaining the annual pace of increase in the amount outstanding of about 6 trillion yen.  Almost two months have passed since this policy decision was made. So far, stock prices and foreign exchange rates have been stable on the whole, and the Bank recognizes that its policy intention was accepted by market participants without misunderstanding. Meanwhile, in the JGB market, transactions have become more active and price movements have increased somewhat (Chart 9). According to a survey conducted in August, the proportion of respondents answering that the degree of bond market functioning "has improved" exceeded the proportion of those answering that it "has decreased" for the first time in about three years. As market transactions usually tend to decrease in summer and it is difficult to grasp actual developments, the Bank will continue to thoroughly examine the degree of 
9  recovery in market functioning.  I have been given the opportunity to talk to you at this time every year, and this is the sixth occasion for me to do so since taking office as Governor of the Bank of Japan in April 2013. Six years ago, economic recovery had just started and overcoming deflation was not in sight. Under such developments in economic activity and prices, it was necessary to decisively implement a large-scale policy, and thus the policy that should be taken and the Bank's thinking behind it were simple and clear. Over the past five years, Japan's economy has continued its long-lasting recovery, corporate profits have been at record highs, and the employment situation has improved substantially. Wages and prices are no longer seeing a sustained decline and have turned to an uptrend. However, achieving the price stability target of 2 percent is taking more time than expected. In such a situation where economic activity and prices have improved significantly but their developments have been somewhat varied, it is appropriate to conduct monetary policy by taking account of a variety of developments in a comprehensive manner. This means that, in continuing with powerful monetary easing, we now need to consider both its positive effects and side effects in a balanced manner. The latest policy response is indeed in line with this thinking, and the Bank's stance toward aiming at price stability with a view to contributing to the sound development of the national economy has not changed at all. Going forward, it will continue to make its utmost efforts as a central bank, taking account of developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions, and thereby firmly support corporate activities in Japan.  Thank you very much for your attention.

1  Financial stability and credit markets in Europe:  Opportunities and risks in the current setting  Professor Claudia M. Buch (Deutsche Bundesbank)  Dinner talk at the second Süddeutsche Zeitung conference on the topic of “private debt and direct lending” Frankfurt am Main 18 September 2018  It is nearly ten years ago to the day that the global financial crisis reached its initial peak. The global economic crisis that followed was the most severe since the Great Depression. In the wake of the crisis, reforms to the financial markets were introduced with the aim of making financial markets more resilient, and many of these reforms have already been implemented. After all, the stability of the financial system is a key prerequisite for an efficient and dynamic economy. Just as preventive medical care and a good immune system help to limit the effects of disease, a prudent approach coupled with good defences helps the financial system to mitigate the effects of economic shocks. The question today is how far the international financial system is better placed to deal with unexpected developments than it was just a decade ago. The global economy is currently fraught with  uncertainty on a number of fronts. Geopolitical tensions have escalated, and trade disputes have erupted, some of which threaten to tip into a trade war. In Europe it is unclear under what circumstances the United Kingdom will leave the European Union. Germany's economy may be booming right now, but every period of growth, no matter how long it lasts, ultimately gives way to an economic downturn. How well prepared is the German financial system to face a potential economic slump? What happens if risks materialise?   
2  1 With the global economy in good shape and interest rates low, risks can be underestimated. The world economy is currently doing well. According to calculations by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), global growth will amount to 3.9% both this year and next year (IMF 2018). For the coming year, the IMF is forecasting only a slight fall in growth from 2.4% to 2.2% for industrial countries and from 2.2% to 1.9% for the euro area.  At the same time, the IMF has emphasised that this growth is not without risk and that some risks are already materialising. For example, the debt level in some emerging market economies has gone up sharply in recent years, and these liabilities are often denominated in foreign currency. This has created vulnerabilities which have surfaced in recent weeks and months. For example, the Turkish lira has lost nearly 40% of its value in the year to date, and the Argentine peso as much as 50%, or thereabouts.1 Thus far, market participants have regarded these issues as relatively isolated incidents. Currently, the effects on global financial markets are small. But possible contagion effects and interactions with global risks are difficult to forecast.  Public and private debt, which are close to their all-time highs in global terms, are one of the global financial system’s vulnerabilities. Industrial countries which bore the brunt of the crisis have seen public debt levels balloon, largely on the back of measures to shore up the financial sector. This has shifted risk from the private sector to the government sector. In many emerging market economies, by contrast, it is above all (non-financial) private sector debt that has increased. In fact, it has more than doubled in recent years. Compounding this situation further, some of these sectors are highly exposed to currency risk.                                                        1 Source: Bloomberg, 14 September 2018. 
3   Banking sector debt has generally diminished in recent years. Measured in terms of risk-weighted assets, the capitalisation of the banking sector at the end of 2017 stood at roughly 17% in the euro area, compared with 14.2% in the United States. However, measured in terms of total (unweighted) assets, these ratios were significantly lower, at 5.8% in Europe and 9.3% in the United States (CGFS 2018). It should be noted that, due to the differing accounting standards, these figures are not directly comparable.  In Germany, banks’ tier 1 capital ratio – i.e. tier 1 capital in relation to risk-weighted assets – has climbed from from 9% at the start of 2008 to 16.4% at the start of 2018 (Chart). The unweighted capital ratio, i.e. tier 1 capital in relation to total assets, rose in the same period from 3.1% to 6.2%.  
4   Furthermore, capital adequacy levels sometimes vary significantly from one bank to the next. The tier 1 capital ratio of the large, systemically important financial institutions in the first quarter of this year stood at 16.9%, while the unweighted capital ratio came to 4.9%. For small and medium-sized banks, the equivalent figures were 15.6% and 8.1%. The wide variation in capital ratios shows that the amount of capital banks have to cushion against unexpected events depends not least on how well future risks are captured by the risk weights. At the moment, the economic environment in Germany is highly favourable. The German economy has now been expanding for nine consecutive years, which is the 
5  longest period of growth since German reunification. According to the Bundesbank’s projections, the economic boom is set to continue, with gross domestic product forecast to rise by 2% this year and 1.9% next year (Deutsche Bundesbank 2018). Enterprises and households alike can borrow cheaply, and they have accumulated comfortable capital buffers. The number of insolvencies and credit defaults is low, and valuations in financial markets are high. This upbeat macroeconomic situation is conducive to a gradual rise in interest rates. Assuming the economy does indeed follow its expected path, the risks to financial stability will probably be limited.  But what if the economy takes an unexpected turn for the worse? What if there is an unforeseen downturn in real economic momentum and interest rates remain low – and close to zero – for even longer, or if political risks materialise and risk premiums spike in financial markets?  A resilient financial system needs to be in a position to weather such scenarios, which though unexpected, cannot be fully ruled out. This is especially true in boom periods, because the longer these continue, the more market participants tend to take them for granted and not prepare for gloomier times. Unexpectedly weak growth and an increase in volatility could then have even greater repercussions. Scenarios like this are not out of the question, even for Germany. The German economy is closely interlinked with the global economy, so it would be hit hard by possible abrupt corrections in international markets. Possible negative effects can be amplified if many market participants are exposed to similar risks. 2 The German financial system is vulnerable to negative macroeconomic developments. Over the last decade, German banks have improved their resilience and built up capital. However, this capital is also counterbalanced by greater macroeconomic risk. The effects of risks on individual banks is something that supervisors keep a watchful eye on. However, an assessment of the overall risk situation needs to look at more than just individual participants or sectors in isolation. A macroprudential, or systemic, perspective is therefore needed to complement the microprudential approach. This way, it is possible to take into account contagion mechanisms in the financial system that can give rise to systemic risks. After all, problematic developments in individual parts of the financial system can ripple out across institutions and ultimately take their toll on the real economy. These amplification effects can particularly come to bear if many banks are exposed to the same risk and if macroeconomic risks correlate strongly with each other. 
6  Monitoring systemic risk in Germany is the task of the German Financial Stability Committee (AFS). The Committee consists of representatives from the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin), the Deutsche Bundesbank, and the German Federal Ministry of Finance, which acts as chair. In its latest report to the German Bundestag, the Committee examined the state of Germany's financial system (German Financial Stability Committee 2018). At present, there is a danger that future economic risks might be underestimated. For example, there could be an unexpected downturn in the economy, which would result in insolvency rates and thus credit risks rapidly rising. Reserves and capital might be insufficient to cover the losses from such an unexpected event, particularly if risk assessments scarcely take into account periods of crisis fraught with economic downturns and correspondingly higher credit default rates, or even ignore them altogether.  In the current long period of economic expansion, there is the possibility that credit risks are being underestimated in the real estate market. This market, which is significant for Germany in macroeconomic terms, could harbour risks to financial stability. This would be the case, for example, if a sharp increase in real estate prices led to an excessive rise in lending and a loosening of credit standards. Prices are continuing to rise dynamically. Bundesbank estimates indicate that house prices in German towns and cities were overvalued by between 15% and 30% in 2017. Growth in residential loans currently stands at 4.3% (second quarter 2018) and thus below its long-term average of 4.8%.2 At the same time, there is no clear evidence to suggest that banks have loosened their credit standards for residential loans. However, given the strong upward pressure on prices in recent years, it cannot be ruled out that the value of loan collateral is being overestimated. The value of loan collateral will probably turn out to be lower, particularly in the event of an economic downturn. This increases the risk of unexpected losses arising as a result of defaults on loans.  One key macroeconomic risk that the German financial system is exposed to is interest rate risk. In recent years, banks have sharply increased the share of new loans with long interest rate lock-in periods. The share of newly issued loans with an interest rate lock-in period of over ten years stood at 45% in the second quarter of 2018; at the start of 2010, this share was markedly lower, at 26%. By contrast, bank funding tends to be of a short-term nature, and often at variable interest rates. This means that banks have become more vulnerable to a potential rise in interest rates. An abrupt increase in interest rates would drive up banks’ financing costs, but their interest income would rise less quickly to begin with.                                                        2  See the Bundesbank’s system of indicators for the German residential property market: https://www.bundesbank.de/Navigation/EN/Statistics/Enterprises_and_households/System_of_indicators/system_of_indicators.html 
7  If risks materialise that are larger than expected, this could set negative momentum in motion in the financial system. In the short term, a critical situation is a particularly inopportune time for banks to raise capital in the markets, at the very time this capital would be needed to absorb losses. Individual banks would then have to shrink their balance sheets in order to fulfil the increased capital requirements. They would have to sell assets, scale back existing lines of credit to the real economy, or cut back on the issuance of new loans. If fire sales send securities or real estate prices plummeting, this can also take its toll on institutions for which loan losses were barely an issue to begin with. 3 Now is the time to strengthen the financial system’s resilience in readiness for tougher times ahead. “The time to repair the roof is when the sun is shining”.3 The International Monetary Fund has repeatedly drawn attention to this principle in recent times. Public sector budgets need to be put on a sustainable footing, debt levels need to be reduced, and budgetary leeway for more difficult times needs to be created.  That said, protection against unexpected macroeconomic developments also needs to be put in place in the financial system, too. Everyone should make provisions for unexpected developments to ensure that they can still service their debt if the economic conditions worsen. Unexpected developments can happen in the home market, but they can also occur in emerging market economies or other industrial countries and then spill over to Germany. Many mature economies are currently experiencing buoyant economic conditions, output gaps have been closed in many cases, and cyclical risks in the financial system are mounting. Financial institutions with higher levels of capital are more robust and thus also make the financial system as a whole more resilient. If all market participants have strong defences, the risk of contagion falls. Unexpected events will then have less severe consequences.  However, resilience needs to be built up in good time – once a recession has begun it may already be too late. It's rather like building up protection against the flu. Once a wave of influenza has broken out, it is too late to get vaccinated. The only problem is that when the weather is fair and you feel well, it is all too easy to forget that times may also take a turn for the worse. It is therefore important to take preventive action. If the financial system is not resilient enough, this can amplify an economic downturn. Banks would then excessively curtail their                                                       3 This quote is attributed to John F. Kennedy. 
8  lending precisely when the economy is already running into difficulties. This is precisely what happened around the globe in the last crisis. Defences therefore have to be built up when times are good.  Currently, the sun is shining on the markets, we are experiencing the longest period of growth since the 1970s, and credit losses are low. Now is the time to build up sufficient capital, which will strengthen the resilience of individual institutions and the financial system as a whole in the event of an economic downturn.

1/4 Opening Address SEACEN-BIS High-Level Seminar Veerathai Santiprabhob, Governor of the Bank of Thailand Bangkok, Thailand 15 September, 2018 Governor Subbarao, Deputy Governors of SEACEN central banks, Executive Director Genberg, Members of SEACEN Executive Committee, Executives from the BIS, Distinguished participants and speakers, Ladies and gentlemen,  Good morning. I am delighted to welcome all of you to the Bank of Thailand for the SEACEN-BIS High-Level Seminar. The theme of this seminar is Digital Technologies, Financial System and Central Bank Policy. These are very important topics, especially for the members of the SEACEN Executive Committee who will play critical roles in shaping strategic direction of the SEACEN and how its programs evolve over the years. The impact of rapid transformation of technology is powerful and far-reaching. Advancement in information technology has given rise to various data technologies and network platforms, changing many facets of our lives and helping uplift productivity for firms and individuals. These developments have led to greater connectivity between nations, cultures, and people and break down the barriers of international trades, supply-chains, and capital flows.   At the same time, these digital transformations, along with new landscapes they introduced, bring new forms of risks for firms and individuals and pose challenges for central banks. Firms will face greater operational risks from IT transformation and cyber threat while being at risk of increased competition and disrupted business models. Widening adoption of automotive process could lead to work displacement; a large number of individuals, especially those in mid-career, will need to be re-trained and equipped with new skill sets. These changes in business and labor market conditions will have considerable impacts on central bank policies and how central banks operate, including those in macroeconomic analysis, payment systems, and financial supervision. Moreover, growing interconnectedness in trade, finance, and supply-chains have resulted in increased real and financial spillovers and globalized price-level, thus complicating central banks’ job of maintaining price and financial stability.  
2/4 Many powerful developments are taking place today, from the growing influence of FinTechs and BigTechs to introduction of cryptocurrencies and electronic payment technologies. For many of us, central bankers, when dealing with new developments that can transform our financial system and how we conduct our policies, several key policy questions are often brought up:  What are the risks and rewards of these developments? Should we regulate them? If so, how best to regulate them? How can we make use of these digital developments in our policy setting? And, what roles could central banks play in promoting new technologies and new digital platforms?  To begin approaching these questions, we first have to admit that the boundary for new innovations or technologies is limitless and their potential impacts, at current juncture, may not be fully uncovered. There are things that we know and things that we don’t. And even what we know and can identify today, our perceptions may be obscured by our perceived understanding based on past world views. There is a fine line between the knowns and the unknowns. Navigating through these will require striking the right balance between having an open mindset to allow innovations to prosper while ensuring that key risks can be contained.  For the “known territory,” essentially developments that we have begun to identify use cases, can control the risks, and believe that the benefits will outweigh the costs, we must continue to refine our understanding, expand our knowledge, and find ways to streamline them into our policymaking process. This is so that the perception or the extent of what we know becomes clearer.  For instance, growing popularity of internet-of-things—from usage of smartphones to various data-transmitting devices—has created massive amount of individual-level and transaction-level data. These “big data” can help unlock our understanding of the behavioral patterns, perhaps, not even realized by individual data owners. At the Bank of Thailand, we have begun employing big data analysis in macroeconomic, banking sector, and financial market assessments to complement our policymaking process. This has helped ensure that our policy actions are evidence-based and timely. At the same time, necessary steps are taken to validate the integrity and quality of data used as well as to safeguard data privacy. We are just scratching the surface of the potential usage of big data and much more work will be done in this area in the years to come.  Many other “known” areas still require further refinement:   from understanding the impacts of deepening adoption of digital technology on productions, labor markets, inflation dynamics, and hence conduct of monetary policy; 
3/4  to the emergence of cryptocurrencies and associated payment technologies that may improve financial inclusion and incorporate ‘smart-contracts’, but may have implications on financial stability, consumer protection and even the environment; and   to the various proof-of-concept initiatives using DLT or Blockchain on wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), where design and technology choices are being explored.  Meanwhile, there remain many puzzles and unknowns, where the costs and benefits are unclear and require much more research, study, and debate to identify potential impacts or to assess whether a particular development should be pursued. These include unknowns such as introduction of retail CBDC, which can have implications on the business model of banks and the financial sector and on transmission mechanism of monetary policy. Or, broader issues such as the autonomy of central bank’s policy, which will be challenged by BigTechs and cross-border technologies, as much of central banking has been designed based on a world with national borders. Other unknowns will arise in the future; all of which dictate that we have to be nimble and forward looking. Ultimately, when facing the challenges from the knowns and unknowns, the role of central banks is not only to understand key issues and provide stewardship in the right direction but also to ensure that benefits and costs are well balanced and unintended consequences minimized. During the period of rapid digital transformations, there is no denying that digital divide can worsen, especially in emerging economies. There will be those with access, are able to take advantage of technological advancement, and prosper; and those who lack access or capability to leverage on modern technology, fall behind, and perish. Finding that right balancing will certainly be a challenge for us, central bankers, but it can be an area where international collaboration and networking platforms, like the SEACEN Centre, can play a role.  Refining the knowns, looking ahead for the unknowns, and balancing our actions. These are how we should approach our policy questions.  I am glad the SEACEN and its organizers have selected a number of topics that will allow us to think deeply about digital transformations and implications for central banks and encourage that future SEACEN activities put even greater emphasis on how we can balance our policy actions and enhance collaboration among members in this new area. I would also like to thank the group of scholars and practitioners here with us today, who will share their thoughts on many important topics, help broaden our perceptions of the knowns, and shed some lights on the unknowns. 
4/4 And on this note, allow me to introduce Governor Duvvuri Subbarao, Former Governor of the Reserve Bank of India and currently a Distinguished Visiting Fellow at the Institute of South Asian Studies of the National University of Singapore. Governor Subbarao has been a staunch advocate of RBI’s pro-active role in addressing financial inclusion to help those underserved. As the world’s second most populous country, India has faced an uphill task to expand financial inclusion, especially to individuals in remote areas. But the numbers speak for themselves: in 2011, just 35 percent of adults have bank accounts according to the World Bank’s Global Findex Report. By 2017 that number has dramatically risen to 80 percent. In his keynote address this morning Governor Subbarao will share with us India’s remarkable experience on improving financial inclusion by using digital technologies.  Please join me in giving a warm welcome to Governor Subbarao. 
Nestor A Espenilla, Jr: Coming together for MSME developmentSpeech by Mr Nestor A Espenilla, Jr, Governor of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP, the centralbank of the Philippines), during the MOA signing of the BSP, DTI, MCPI and APPEND, Manila, 17September 2018.*   *   *Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) Secretary Ramon M. Lopez;  Mr. Kamrul H. Tarafder,Board Trustee of the Microfinance Council of the Philippines, Inc. (MCPI); Mr. Edgardo F. Garcia,Chairperson of the Alliance of Philippine Partners in Enterprise Development, Inc. (APPEND);members of the Monetary Board; co-workers in government; fellow BSPers and advocates offinancial inclusion and MSME development; ladies and gentlemen; good afternoon.The MSME sector is a crucial driver of the economy, making up 99.6% of our country’senterprises or registered business firms.  MSMEs generate 61.6% of employment. Thus, developing, empowering, building the capacities of MSMEs and including them in thefinancial system, fuels the foundation of our economy as the engine for broad-based growth.  There are currently many existing initiatives for MSMEs. DTI’s Negosyo Centers, among manyother programs, serve as “one-stop-shops” for MSME registration, business development andadvisory services, and market exposure, among others. Our network of microfinance non-government organizations (MF NGOs) is a significant source of financial products and servicesfor our country’s microentrepreneurs. But despite existing efforts, challenges with MSME development still persist.  These challengesinclude lack of access to resources such as technology, skilled labor, and information. Today,however, we shall focus on the particular issue of financial access.MSMEs are unable to reach their full potential because of difficulty of credit and financial access. Currently, only 6.6% and 9.8% of total loans in the banking system and total businessescomprise investments to MSMEs.  This low level of investment in MSMEs translates to capitalconstraints compelling MSMEs to resort to internal savings or earnings. A World Bank reportstates that 81.2% of Philippine enterprises rely mostly on internal funds to finance theirinvestments. Only 10.1% of enterprises use bank financing. As a staunch advocate of financial inclusion and of promoting broad-based growth, we at theBSP are very concerned about these numbers.  We are committed to providing a regulatoryenvironment to address financial access barriers such as cost, information asymmetry, and lackof infrastructure, among others.At the BSP, we continually undertake prudential reforms to improve the overall environment forcredit allocation.  We issued Circular No. 855 to encourage banks to focus on cash flow analysisand ability-to-pay rather than collateral when determining a borrower’s creditworthiness. Complementing this is Circular No. 950 on the implementation of the Anti-Money Laundering Actwhich reduces Know-Your-Customer (KYC) rules for certain low-risk accounts.  This is tofacilitate frictionless customer on-boarding and reach unserved and underserved markets.The BSP oversees the Credit Surety Fund (CSF) Program, a credit enhancement scheme toimprove MSME credit worthiness.  Through the promotion of fintech and use of digital payments, we aim to achieve a moreexpanded physical and virtual reach of financial services, more competition, easier on-boardingof customers, and more protection for financial consumers.  Our MSMEs will surely benefit frominitiatives to broaden their customer reach, reduce the costs of managing cash, and provide 1 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
greater access to credit.There is much to be done but it is only when we work together that we can succeed.Through this event, we forge a partnership which will leverage on the existing strengths,expertise and initiatives of our agencies and institutions so that we could, collectively deliver aresponsive and holistic approach to MSME financing. With a more stable and secure source of much needed funds, coupled with access to resourcessuch as technology and capacity building, we hope to catalyze the development of the MSMEsector. We envision that each Negosyo Center will be fully capacitated to provide the full suite ofservices required by our MSMEs, including a referral mechanism to appropriate financingwindows. With an institutionalized partnership, financial institutions will likewise benefit from richinsights and a deeper understanding of the market, which will be most useful in customizingfinancial products and services for their constituents.As a champion for microfinance and financial inclusion, and as Chair of the National Strategy forFinancial Inclusion (NSFI), the BSP’s interest lies in bridging existing networks to serve ascomprehensive platforms to harmonize initiatives and cultivate sectors in need.  This effort isalso in line with our vision of synergizing efforts and forging more efficient, collaborativemechanisms to achieve the shared financial inclusion objective.  I am sure more partnershipsanchored in the NSFI are yet to come.From experience, we know that to effectively address challenges of financial inclusion, a multi-agency, multi-stakeholder, collaborative approach is needed.  This realization is the driving forcebehind the NSFI on which today’s partnership and coordinating efforts are founded. While we are starting with microfinance and MF NGOs, we hope to eventually bring on-board,other financial institutions so that the range of available products and services for MSMEs can becompleted.While this is our long term goal, our partnership celebrated today, definitely brings us a steptowards greater developments in the current financing ecosystem. We extend our gratitude to our partners and look forward to jointly shaping the future of MSMEs.  Let this signing ceremony be the start of a fruitful undertaking!Maraming salamat po sa inyong lahat!  2 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
Gent Sejko: The productivity slowdown and the secular stagnationhypothesisOpening address by Mr Gent Sejko, Governor of the Bank of Albania, at the presentation by MrPatrizio Pagano, Executive Director for Albania at the World Bank Group, Tirana, 18 September2019.*   *   *Dear friends, colleagues and media representatives,Thank you for your participation!I have the honour to launch today a presentation on “The Productivity Slowdown and the SecularStagnation Hypothesis”.The productivity and its role on economic growth is an argument, which, in the aftermath of thelast global crisis, is at the centre stage in the agenda of researchers and decision-makers of theeconomy.The recent decades had never seen before such a duration, intensity and complexity of thiscrisis. The global economy experienced the longest and deepest economic slowdown andrecession, since the Great Depression in 1930s.  Certainly, it was a real drama for the nationaleconomies, as well as enterprises and households. Nevertheless, the crisis served as acatalyser to re-assess the economic ideas and a great laboratory to test them.The book titled “International Macroeconomics in the Wake of the Global Financial Crisis” hasbeen added to the existing vast body of economic literature that studies the challenges to variouseconomies in detail. This book is a collection of research work by experts of the Banque deFrance, Banca d’Italia and Banco de España on the major topics in the post-crisis period.Through the systematic investigation of:structural problems in the economy, in more concrete terms, the correlation betweenadvancements in technology, productivity, globalisation and potential growth;problems incurred by the global trade and promotion of consumption and investments;problems that the monetary policy has faced and continues to face, due to the heighteneduncertainties, fall in the natural interest rate and the chronic low inflation; and the increasing interdependence of global economies, due to the financial integration and therole of financial flows and interest rates in small and developing economies,the authors provide a precious contribution to the professional debate present in this field.We are honoured to have among us today one of the authors of this publication, Mr PatrizioPagano.  He is present today as both the World Bank Group Executive Director for Italy, Albania,Greece, Malta, Portugal, San Marino and Timor-Leste and as an academic with a long-standinghistory of scientific publications while serving as the Head of Advanced Economies andInternational Finance Division within the Directorate General for Economics, Statistics andResearch of the Bank of Italy. Mr Pagano has cooperated and co-authored several articles withdistinguished institutions, such as: Bocconi University and University of California, Berkeley.As I emphasised earlier, Mr Pagano will discuss on the role of productivity on economic growth,in particular, the recent debate triggered by the hypothesis that advanced economies aredoomed to experience a long period, why not decades, of slowdown of economic growth anddeceleration of welfare improvement. 1 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
I would rather not anticipate the findings in the presentation, but I must say that I feel encouragedby the finding that this hypothesis is likely not to be true.Productivity and its role on economic growth has always been a central theme at the focus of theattention at the Bank of Albania.  Our studies suggest that, beyond the cyclical fall in theaggregate demand, the economic slowdown in Albania, after the crisis, has had a strongstructural element.  In other words, the reduction by half of the economic growth pace before andafter the crisis, shows both the slowdown in the expansion of demand for goods and services,and the slowdown in the capacity of the economy to provide these products. In particular, ourstudies have found that the degree of expansion of productivity in the Albanian economy –broadly defined as the capacity of an economy to utilise labour and physical capital to generateoutput – is reduced in this period from 2% to 1%.  For this reason, the growth of productivity has been and should remain a guideline in the agendaof structural reforms in Albania. In this context, the conclusion in today’s presentation that thecurrently slow growth in productivity, globally, does not necessary represent a new “normal” ofthe economy, is a further encouragement for the success of reforms in Albania.Let me now explain this argument in greater detail.First, the Albanian economy has been going through a restructuring process of its growth model. Among others, this process envisages a higher reliance of growth on export oriented sectors –such as industry and tourism – and a further orientation of financial resources towards theexpansion of investments. The shift in financial, human and management resources betweensectors of the economy needs time and is followed by a temporary slowdown of productivity. Nevertheless, rebalancing the sources of growth – from construction and trade towards industryand export-related services – has already started.  This shift is noted even in the symmetricrebalancing of banking credit portfolio.Second, the level and speed of productivity expansion is directly connected with the level ofeducation and qualification of the labour force. The educational system reform and the emphasison vocational training are essential dimensions of the economy’s restructuring, whose benefitswill increasingly become clearer in the long run.  However, Albania still has a lot of work to do inthis regard, in particular with regard to containing the migration of its qualified labour force andthe renewal of its labour force skills by the private sector.Third, productivity is closely connected with the improvement of business management skills.The campaign to enhance formal business practices, the gradual increase of competition, andthe revision of the law on bankruptcy will provide the necessary stimulus in this regard. Inparticular, I am confident that the legal improvements regarding the enforcement of bank creditcontract will not only help the banks’ soundness, but will also contribute to increasing thediscipline and effectiveness in the use of funds by the Albanian enterprises.Finally, I would like to highlight that unlike the advanced economies, which are on the technologyfrontier, and see their progress related to their ability for innovation, Albania has considerablespace for development through the adoption of the existing technologies and practices. In thislight, our task remains to choose and implement the tested models of development.Based on the above, I am confident that Albania has all the premises to increase productivityand, in this way, to accelerate the economic growth pace and increase the welfare of theAlbanian people.  What is needed now is a consensus on the vision for the development of thecountry and a shared will to implement it.Dear participants,I am fully convinced that this presentation will further enrich our debate on these issues. 2 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches

  1   10 years on – What have we learned? Remarks by Sharon Donnery, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland Dublin Economics Workshop, Wexford 14 September 2018   Introduction  It is a great pleasure to be with you today, and I would like to thank the organisers for arranging the event and inviting me to participate on this panel.i  The Dublin Economics Workshop has always been a key policy forum and September 2018 – ten years on – gives us a timely opportunity to look back and consider not only what we have learned - the Central Bank included – but also, what has been achieved, and critically, what must yet be addressed.  The crisis affected every aspect of Irish society, of the Irish economy, of the Irish banking system. A decade later, significant numbers of people across the country are still dealing with its legacies. Whilst it may be tempting to look at the uniqueness of the Irish experience, taking a wider perspective shows that “the last 400 years has been replete with financial crises, which often followed increases in supplies of credit, greater investor optimism, and more rapid economic growth.”ii This is not to minimise the Irish crisis and its effects, merely to stress that history shows us that we must always be on guard against the next potential crisis. 
  2  The story of the causes of the Irish crisis has been well told, so I will not repeat it here. iii The herding behaviour, groupthink, speculative mania, and information gaps, have all been well documented.iv Today, I would like to highlight what I see as five key lessons. Whilst not unique to the Irish experience, some are lessons which we in Ireland learned, to devastating effect, the ‘hard way’.  What I will say is that the overall governance, regulatory and supervisory system is designed with lines of responsibility to manage and mitigate risk effectively. In the banking and financial sector, the primary responsibility for risk management in individual financial institutions lies with their executive management and boards of directors. This is supported by internal audit and compliance functions within the banks, and external auditors. Legislators set rules, regulators define and implement the regulatory framework, and supervisors oversee firms’ behaviour, enforce this framework and enforce sanctions in the case of non-compliance.v  Each plays a role in the system with its own responsibilities.   “Systemic financial crises – both in Ireland and elsewhere – are uncommon because they require such a large number of simultaneous institutional and judgmental failures.”vi For central banks and regulatory authorities, and particularly the Central Bank of Ireland, the crisis transformed everything we do: our mandate, our organisation, our frameworks for assessment, our policy instruments, our culture.  So whilst I will not try and be exhaustive today, as I said, I will focus on five key lessons from both a domestic and European perspective.  
  3  *** Lesson 1: we must act to mitigate the build-up of systemic risk  Before the crisis, Irish banks built up a heavy reliance on funding from wholesale markets and hence were more vulnerable to a sudden stop. The crisis also laid bare the lack of analytical frameworks to assess financial imbalances and the lack of policy tools to mitigate them.vii Therefore, following the crisis, the argument for new policy instruments to mitigate risks to financial stability became compelling, and the development of macroprudential policies and instruments followed.viii The ultimate objective of macroprudential policy is to mitigate systemic risk, as major disturbances to the financial system can disrupt the provision of financial services, which can have serious negative consequences for the real economy.ix    In Ireland, the Central Bank was designated the National Macroprudential Authority in 2014 and the introduction of macroprudential policies by the Central Bank has been a key step for promoting financial stability.x These tools aid the Central Bank in building resilience for households and the banking system, such that they can better withstand economic shocks or adverse movements in credit or property prices.  The mortgage rules are now an established element of the macro-financial landscape and have an important structural dimension, with the aim of permanently dampening the pro-cyclicality of credit and house prices (relative to the experience prior to the rules being in place).  The widespread public understanding for the Central Bank’s mortgage measures is positive. We are very conscious that the 
  4  deposit requirements are a heavy burden on many people trying to build for their future. However, there is I think, a public understanding that as hard as that is, these measures are necessary and better than the alternative. Ultimately, they are just as much about protecting households, as they are about promoting stability.  From a broad cyclical perspective, ensuring resilience is built early in the cycle is most effective – and this has informed the timing and calibration of the mortgage measures and the counter cyclical capital buffer (CCyB). This so-called CCyB is another example of a tool that can build resilience in the banking system to withstand future shocks.  We recently announced an increase in the CCyB to 1 per cent, which becomes effective in July 2019.xi Structural systemic risk, related to the “too-big” or “too complex” to fail phenomenon, is mitigated by the Other Systemically Important Institutions (O-SII) buffer, which has been set at rates up to 1.5 per cent for the relevant institutions, with a phase-in period from 1 July 2019 to 1 July 2021.xii One key point to note when looking back at the crisis is that while the use of macroprudential tools may not have averted the crisis a decade ago, the scale of the downturn in Ireland could have been limited and the high cost to citizens reduced. We must therefore continue to guard against complacency and build up resilience across the system.  So in short, a key lesson from the crisis therefore was the importance of developing credible counter-cyclical macroprudential policy and strengthening micro-prudential policy to mitigate systemic risk. This is what the Central Bank has been doing for the last decade.  
  5  *** Lesson 2: all actors in the economy need to build resilience  As a small, particularly open economy, Ireland can be significantly influenced by external events. Ireland has benefitted greatly from our openness. However, the other side of this coin is our vulnerability to external shocks, over which we may have little control. We do not have to look far for evidence of this. Over the past twenty-five years or so growth in employment, incomes, consumption, domestic investment, real estate prices and credit have been more volatile in Ireland than in the euro area, the United Kingdom, Sweden or Denmark.xiii The key to dealing with this vulnerability is not to retreat from the global marketplace, but to recognise that we need to be prepared for inevitable downturns. In this context, building resilience, whether in banks, at the individual, household, corporate, or national level is key.  All stakeholders have their part to play in this process.  We have seen progress, for example, in household debt statistics – Irish household debt as a proportion of disposable income fell by 49.8 percentage points between Q1 2014 and Q1 2018. However, despite this progress the legacy of the crisis is still apparent, as Irish households continue to be the fourth most indebted in the EU.xiv From a national perspective, fiscal policy is one of the most important policy levers available. One of the trade-offs of joining a monetary union is the loss of an independent monetary policy. This trade-off increases the relative importance of fiscal policy, in addition to macroprudential policy, as a lever that can be used to mitigate country specific 
  6  shocks in the way that a broad, union wide, monetary policy cannot. The fiscal position in Ireland in the years after joining the economic and monetary union (EMU) appeared favourable. The debt to GDP ratio continued to trend downward and the budget showed a surplus. However, these headline figures obscured a significant shift in the structure of tax revenues. The share of revenue collected by income taxes fell, while the share for property related taxes such as stamp duty and capital gains tax increased.xv  Debt to GNI* - a measure which avoids the distortions encountered when using GDP - stood at 28 per cent in 2007 and peaked at 158 per cent in 2012.xvi In 2017, debt to GNI* stood at 111 per cent.  The adverse effects this tax structure had in the crisis years, highlights the need for a broad-based and stable tax base, rather than one dependent on windfall revenues. It also exposed that using potentially transitory revenue items to fund regular expenditure can exacerbate deteriorations in the fiscal position during a downturn.  The recovery in the public finances has been dramatic relative to the situation faced during the early crisis years. Significant fiscal consolidation played a large part, as did some favourable external factors, including unexpectedly positive growth and low interest costs.xvii  These factors illustrate the need to strike a cyclically-appropriate fiscal balance to strengthen resilience and build buffers to counteract future shocks.  The characteristics of Ireland, as an extremely open economy with significant trade and financial linkages to the broader 
  7  international economy, as well as downside risks to the economy, such as Brexit, add to this need.  So, the second key lesson is all actors in the economy need to build resilience, be they individuals, households, corporates, banks or indeed governments. *** Lesson 3: in addition to the level of regulatory capital, the type and quality matter Turning specifically to the banking sector, whilst in Ireland, aggregate capital resources of banks grew from 2000-2007, and banks maintained their regulatory requirements, the composition of capital changed materially.  The proportion of shareholder equity in the covered banks’ capital decreased significantly, with the balance being made up by subordinated loan capital.xviii  Ordinary shares, however, were found to be the main effective loss-absorbing instrument on a going concern basis. In response to the crisis, European legislation was agreed to create a safer financial sector. A key aspect is the establishment of a more robust framework for setting minimum capital requirements. The Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) and Capital Requirements Directive (CRD IV) were agreed in 2013 and revised the capital requirements for banks.  The framework provides for a Pillar I Requirement, which is the regulatory minimum amount of capital that banks must hold. This is a minimum total Capital Ratio of 8% of their Risk Weighted Assets (RWA). As part of those revisions, the highest quality capital, Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1), typical items of 
  8  which include ordinary shares and reserves, must now, following various deductions and adjustments, correspond to 4.5% of RWA. Pillar II is an additional capital requirement that may be applied to institutions by supervisors and is based on the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP). The institution specific nature of Pillar II ensures that a bank’s capital is tailored to their individual business models and risk profiles. In addition to the Pillar II capital requirement, competent authorities may also set non-binding Pillar II capital guidance that relevant banks will be expected to hold.  The Combined Buffer Requirement is the collective term for the four capital buffers provided for in CRDIV. This includes the aforementioned CCyB and O-SII buffer, as well as the Capital Conservation Buffer and Systemic Risk buffer.  The Combined Buffers act firstly as a mechanism for pro-cyclical accumulation of capital, so that institutions can build a store of supplementary own funds in ‘good times’ in order to protect their regulatory minimum during periods of adverse conditions. If a bank breaches the buffer, automatic safeguards apply to limit the amount of dividends and bonus payments it can make.  The key point here, however, is buffers must be made of CET1, the highest quality capital.  And much progress has been made, since the end of 2014, the fully loaded CET1 ratio of Significant Institutions in Ireland has increased from 9.4 per cent to 17.7 per cent at end-2017.  So in short, the third key lesson from the crisis I want to mention today was that, in addition to the level, the type and quality of capital matter. Progress has been made in many other areas too. My colleague Ed Sibley, Deputy Governor, 
  9  Prudential Regulation outlined in more detail the specific regulatory and supervisory response, earlier this week.xix *** Lesson 4: some banks will inevitably fail - we just have to be better prepared The level of public support to the banking system during the crisis in the EU was staggering. In 2009, Member States provided the equivalent of 7.3% of EU GDP, or EUR 906 billion in liquidity support and guarantees to the financial sector. Ireland stands out beyond any other Member State in terms of the relative support it provided following the far-reaching 2008 decision to guarantee all liabilities and deposits. Beyond liquidity and support, Member State governments provided capital support amounting to 4.5% of EU GDP between 2008 and 2012. Ireland, for example spent the equivalent of 37.3% of GDP recapitalising its banks over the period.xx This motivated a fundamental change in how banks and authorities prepare for and manage bank failure. In Ireland, as a direct response to the crisis, we introduced the Credit Institutions Resolution Act in 2011. In a European context, the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) now provides authorities with common European rules for the recovery and resolution of failing banks. When banks get into difficult financial situations, the supervisor now has a number of early intervention powers at its disposal. The BRRD also requires each bank to prepare a recovery plan which outlines what it will do if it gets into difficulty. The Central Bank of Ireland was designated as the Irish National Resolution Authority in 2015. In this context, the Bank is also part of the Single Resolution 
  10  Mechanism and we draw up firm-specific resolution plans with the aim of enhancing the resolvability of the firms.  Central to the BRRD is that the authorities have a variety of powers to try and  minimise the cost to taxpayers of a bank failure. Critically, the new framework introduces bail-in tools and also aims to ensure that banks have a sufficient stock of bail-inable liabilities. This is known as the minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL). In short, the objective of this is to ensure that shareholders and creditors bear the brunt of losses in bank failures, thus moving from bail-out to bail-in. Ensuring banks have sufficient and high quality MREL goes a long way to increasing their gone-concern loss absorbing capacity. So in short, the fourth key lesson is that some banks will inevitably fail, to protect taxpayers we must actively prepare for their failure and ensure that impediments to resolvability are removed.   Major legislative and institutional changes took place to ensure authorities are equipped with the tools that enhance both the resilience and the resolvability of  institutions, which will be better prepared to deal with, and recover from, a crisis situation. But ensuring the effectiveness of the framework remains a challenge for the years to come. *** Lesson 5: the need for cross-border authorities The final lesson I wish to discuss today is the need for cross-border authorities.  The crisis exposed the weaknesses and heterogeneity in banking supervision across Member States.  Of course, the 
  11  failures in banking supervision in Ireland have been comprehensively examined and well documented, particularly in the (2010) Honohan Report.xxi Some of the conclusions of the report showed that the then ‘Financial Regulator’ relied “excessively on a regulatory philosophy emphasising process over outcomes,” that “a greater degree of intrusiveness and assertiveness” was required on the part of the regulator and there was a need for “additional staff resources and training.”xxii  The crisis also exposed the weaknesses in the framework for resolution – as I just discussed, but also the fundamental mismatch between cross-border banking and domestic crisis management, in addition to the lack of adequate, and harmonised powers authorities had to deal with crises.  Prior to the crisis, the authorities, legal powers, objectives and tools for crisis management and resolution varied considerably across the EU. For example, in some cases the relevant powers were derived from specific resolution or insolvency frameworks for banks, while in others only the general insolvency proceedings were available. In some cases, Member State authorities had the power to transfer assets to a third party purchaser by executive order, in others by judicial proceedings, for example.xxiii These differences, coupled with the lack of a harmonised approach to burden-sharing and a weak framework for cooperation (in the form of voluntary cross-border colleges/stability groups) made effective, rapid, coordinated cross-border intervention very challenging.  In a monetary union, where subsidiaries were the main form of cross-border banking holding almost EUR 4 trillion of assets by 2006, the lack of incentives to cooperate and coordinate 
  12  compounded the lack of trust across the system.xxiv The well documented collapse in the inter-bank market led to the need for central banks to aggressively step in to provide liquidity in order to prevent the collapse of the financial system.  The response to the crisis was a wholesale change in the legislative framework, policy tools and the institutional architecture for banking supervision and resolution. This culminated most visibly with the establishment of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) with the ECB in Frankfurt at its centre, and the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) with the Brussels based Single Resolution Board (SRB) at its centre.  So in short, the final lesson that became abundantly clear was the need for cross-border authorities. A major institutional overhaul of the architecture of Economic and Monetary Union ensued to complement Banking Union. Key elements have been addressed but the work is not yet complete.  If “stability” is the short-hand we use to describe the objective of these changes, it is important to stress that we seek to safeguard stability precisely because of its importance for citizens. Building on this, the changes I outlined above have been accompanied by a parallel, and interrelated, series of changes to strengthen the consumer protection framework.  European legislation improved protection for consumers in areas such as mortgage credit, payment services, insurance distribution and investments. The Central Bank both contributed to this work and strengthened the domestic framework. This included the enhancement of the Consumer Protection Code, the introduction of the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, the SME Lending Code and subsequent SME Lending Regulations, and more.  
  13  *** Conclusion So, is it all sorted then? Clearly no, much remains to be done.  On the institutional side, the review of the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) and ongoing debate on the need for a European Deposit Insurance Scheme and a pan-European Anti Money Laundering (AML) authority show the institutional architecture necessary to sustain Banking Union is not yet complete and further work must be undertaken.  Enhancing the MREL targets based on the outcome of resolvability assessments and developing a policy for transfer strategies all remain ongoing initiatives.xxv Moreover, the backstop to the Single Resolution Fund needs to be quickly operationalised. Now that important steps have been taken to address bank failure, the authorities will need to turn their attention to other significant players in the financial sector such as financial market infrastructure and insurance firms. Turning to resilience, debt to GNI* in Ireland is still elevated and remains above 100 per cent. As outlined by the Governor of the Central Bank in a recent speech, given the particularly favourable economic growth in recent years, the projection of a general government deficit in 2019 does not appear to be a sufficiently ambitious fiscal policy.xxvi  On the macroprudential side, building resilience most effectively requires balancing timing, policy-mix and policy calibration, depending on the nature of the systemic risk being addressed. Technical work is ongoing to assess whether we can strengthen the framework further.xxvii   However, much progress has been made.  
  14  And ten years on, it is important to take stock and acknowledge this. Banks are now jointly supervised and resolved by cross-border institutions. Banks and authorities are better prepared for bank failures, which should reduce the cost to taxpayers in the future. The level, type and quality of regulatory capital has increased and the loss-absorbing capacity of banks has improved. We now actively intervene to address systemic risk and pro-cyclicality in the system. Also, there is a cognisance to Ireland’s vulnerability as a small open economy and the need for all sectors to build resilience.  We should keep the lessons from the crisis to the forefront of our mind, in our work, in our thinking, and in our communications. Then, our combined efforts to highlight and address risks and build resilience will make the financial system stronger and safer, thereby safeguarding stability and protecting consumers.

2How the Bahamian Financial System Serves Bahamian Society:  Why OurAML/CFT Reputation IsImportant1Remarks by John A Rolle,Governor, Central Bank ofThe BahamasatThe Bahamas Anti-Money Laundering andCountering the Financing of Terrorism Risk Management Conference,Nassau, Bahamas, 17 September, 2018.IntroductionGood morning.I propose to review the ways in which the Bahamian financial services industry servesBahamian society, and also touch upon a few ways in which this can be and will be improved.  I will thenoutline why the Bahamian jurisdiction’s AML/CFT reputation is a critical determinant of our financialservices industry’s ability to prosper and grow, and summarise our current international standing, asrepresented in various league tables.The take away from this that we musttransform the domestic financial sector in waysthat promotemore internally self-sustaininggrowth; fortify the international sector in ways that protect and expandupon its direct economic contribution;andthat we must exploitand amplify the positivefeedbackfromthedirectionofenhanced AML/CFT frameworksin favour of increasedeconomicresilience, andfromthe direction oftargetedfinancial sector development, access and inclusionin favour of increasedAML/CFT effectiveness.Why WeCareabout theFinancialServicesSector-theDomesticStoryThe Bahamian domestic financial system provides all the benefits typical to a country of our size andeconomic development.  We have direct financial intermediationof savings—across a wide rangeofsectors and activities.We have riskpooling, and we have specialist services such as paymentsprocessing.Inparticular:-The banking sector provides a safe place to store liquid funds,allocatecredit, andprocesspayments;-The insurance sector provides risk pooling and investment products;and-The securities and pensions sector provide investment productsas an extension of the savingsprocess.A well-functioning domestic financial sector serves society by making us safer, wealthier, more resilientto financial distress;and better able to manage the risks and returns in the real economy.It should alsodistinguish itself byconverting savings into investments, orinto usesthatgenerate net positive,long-term benefits.1Asprepared fordelivery.
3How does the Bahamian financial sector stack upagainstthese criteria?In some ways well, in otherways not so well.The BahamianEconomyIt will be helpful for this discussion for us all to be reminded of the following facts.First,the Bahamian resident population is less than 400,000, so in population terms we arequiteasmallcountry.We are alsosignificantlysmall in terms of our weight in the global economy, and in terms ofhow sensitive we are to fluctuations of a policy or economic nature that radiate in our direction fromthe outside world.On the otherhand,TheBahamasenjoysafairly highaverage per capitaincome,eventhoughthis position has not improved in some years.After the 2007 to 2010 global financial crisis, the Bahamian economy sufferedthrough an extendedperiodofchallenges, including falls in asset values, and on average near-zero income growth.Therecovery is onlynow becoming entrenched, but atlevelsofpotential growth thatarestill unsatisfactory.How do wethenachievemoresubstantial and sustainable economic growth?  Part of the answer is thatwemust fostera domestic financial system that better supports such growthand in more instances,canseed such growth.  I wish to emphasise, however, that the financial system cannot manufactureeconomic growth out of thinair.As it now stands, ourfinancial systemdoes bestatsupportingthegrowth potential that iscreated in the economy.Most of the enterprisesthat attractdomestic bankcredit are in sectors that do notearn foreign exchange. Their prospects are linked to the second roundeffects of thrivingforeign exchange earning sectorssuch as tourism.Thisis what economist would termas a “pro-cyclical”dependence.Itcan only bereduced if more of the creditprovided bybankshelps toexpandthoselocalenterprises thatare either direct earners of foreign exchangeor thosethathelpconserve onourforeign exchange dependency.(0.40)(0.10)1.00(1.70)1.40-2.0-1.5-1.0-0.50.00.51.01.52.0$25.8$26.0$26.2$26.4$26.6$26.8$27.0$27.2$27.4$27.6$27.820132014201520162017Per cent$ ThousandsChart 1: The Bahamian EconomyGDP/Capita ($‘000)Real GDP Growth (%)Source: Department ofStatistics
4It is also important to remember that the financial system is the second largest industry in The Bahamas,comprising 15to20per cent of GDP depending upon the definitions used.  A growing financial industrygenerates jobs, and they tend to be well-paying jobs.The Bahamian public and private sectors have identified a great many reforms necessary to improve theunderlying growth potential in our economy.  As these reforms are delivered, the financial system willhelp translate potential growth into actual growth.Domestic BankingSectorOur domestic banking system is soundly capitalized and nowadays solidly profitable.However,it isnotsufficientlyincentivized to allocateor providecreditin waysthat would betterservethe economy.In the five years from 2013 to 2018, domestic private credit shrank from$6.5billion to under$6billion.Even moresoremarkably,commercial loans fell to well under $1 billion, and well under 10 per cent ofGDP.Unfortunatelyit speaks to the pro-cyclical constraintson creditjust mentioned;tothelow-qualityinformation environmentsurrounding borrower risksand to arewardstructuremostfavoring consumerlendingover other forms of credit.  It is notsimply reversible by lowering interest rates, becausethecredit stimulus—skewed to consumer financing—would exhaust rather than sustain the support wevalue for the fixed exchangerate.To give a sense of perspective on this level of lending, the Bahamian private credit to GDP ratio iscurrentlyabout55percent.  The same ratio among the largeand developedeconomies in the G20$6.55$6.17$5.95010203040506070$0.0$1.0$2.0$3.0$4.0$5.0$6.0$7.020132014201520162017Mar-18Jun-18Per cent$ BillionsChart 2: Domestic Banking-Private Sector LendingEnterprises ($Bn)Households ($Bn)Total Private Credit ($Bn)Private Cedit/GDP (%)Source: Central Bank of The Bahamas
5ranges fromaround 150to over 200 percent.Currently,Canada has the highest ratio at 267 percent.We are in the curious situationwherethecarryingorsustainablecapacity for creditinCanadais severalmultiples greater thanisbeingsustained inThe Bahamas, where we are both serviced by the sameleadinginstitutions—and arguably,technology and capital are not the hurdlesto be surmounted.I am not advocatingan expansionin Bahamian private sector credit to these much higher levels.  Butincomparison to other countries, Bahamian bank lending could stand to be larger, and still be prudent.That is,particularly, ifweincentivisemore lendingof the right mix, to fundmore counter-cyclicalbusiness and investment growth.In the process,theeconomycouldalso besustainablylarger andmoreprosperous.The transformation neededistodecrease thenumber of cents out each dollarof incomeearned that must be spenton imports.There are five conditions precedent for confident bank lending:-Sufficient capital-Sufficient liquidity-Sufficient information about borrowers-A clear ability to collect on problem loans-Confidence inthe general prospects for the economyBahamian banks at this point have plenty of capital and liquidity.  What they lack is borrowerinformation, and perhaps confidence incollecting problem loans, and/or confidence in the businessprospects forThe Bahamas.The Central Bank is already progressing several initiatives that will improve bank confidence to lend.This includes a program of reducing the industry’s aggregate non-performing loans,establishingaBahamian credit reporting bureau, and commencing a program to move moredomestictransactionsfrom cash to electronic methods.Just in 2017, theCentral Bank relaxedcapital controls on access tofinancing in foreign currency for enterprises,that would make our credit policies more countercyclical,and therefore of a moresustainedimpact onstrongergrowth.Two issues are highly relevant inthe AML/CFT context.First, “sufficient information” about a customer extends beyond the customer’s financial standing, tothe customer’s potential to ensnare the bank in a financial crime matter.The Central Bank, theBahamian government, and the public sector overall haveundertaken a great many reforms, in this areathat you willhear about duringthis conference. One benefit from these reforms is that Bahamian banksand other financial institutions will be able to deal with their customers with greater confidenceregarding the customer’s non-involvement in financial crime.  Furthermore, through its regulation andsupervision, the Central Bank will be able to demonstrate to interested stakeholders that the Bahamianbanking system is reasonably well insulated against AML/CFT risks.Our colleagues at the other Bahamian financial regulators have taken or are taking similar steps to liftpublic and private confidence in the AML/CFT robustness of their regulatedentities. We can neverguarantee that no customer will ever put tainted money into a Bahamian financial institution.  We are,however,approaching the day when we can undertake that no Bahamian financial institution has asubstantial or systemic exposure to laundered money or terrorist financing.
6The second AML/CFT confidence issue is more macro than customer-focused.  The Bahamas,in commonwith many other small countries,stillfacesa material threat fromdiminished orcut-off access tointernational correspondent bankingor“de-risking”.  We face the actual consequences of moredifficulty in undertaking cross-bordertransactions.  This difficulty extends beyond the financial system toall businesses.Faced with de-risking threats, domestic banks may validly conclude that the Bahamianeconomy is more vulnerable to correspondent banking abandonment than they find comfortable.Our work on lifting AML/CFT risk management, and all the other regulator work, will over time reducethis risk.It’s worth notingthat moving the bulk of Bahamian payments from cash to electronic will generate agreat many benefits for our society and economy.  Among these benefits, commercial borrowers will beable to document their receipts and expenses more credibly, and over time this must help in obtainingbank loans.TheInternationalBanking SectorMoving to the international banking and trust sector, I will show youtwohopefully interesting slides.Funds held by the sector inThe Bahamas have decreased in the past several years.  In broad terms, TheBahamas is no longer in the business of hiding money from international tax authorities.  We have seena considerable return of now-compliant clients to their home jurisdictions, oralternatively to the UnitedStates.$558$511$4090100200300400500600201220132014201520162017Jun-18$ BillionsChart 3: International Banking AssetsOn-Balance Sheet AssetsFiduciary AssetsTotal AssetsSource: Central Bank of The Bahamas
7Nevertheless,employment in the sector has remained more or less constant over the past several years.So jobs are holding up, despite thedecrease in funds under management.  The Central Bank’sinterpretation of this is that the remaining international clients are receiving value-addingtrustee,advice, and management services.  Those services make for “stickier” clients, and they also require morestaff per client.We alsoobservethathome-supervised institutions, which have no overseas parent, have been growingtheirstaffrelative to host-supervised institutions.  In 2012, about a quarter of the industry worked forBahamian-owned or headquartered firms, and this proportion has increased to a third.  We expect tosee the Bahamian-owned international banking sector continue to increase in proportion to theoffshore-owned sector.Where does this leave the international banking and trust sector?  Clearly, smaller than it was a fewyears agoin balance sheet terms, but still substantial.  The average wage for the jobs in this sectorexceeds $100,000 per year.  Furthermore, the sector supports a great many service jobs in areas such asaccounting, law, and consulting.The Central Bank expects that the number of international banks and trust companies willdecreasesome more, as several small entities have indicated their intent to exit The Bahamas.  This does notnecessarily mean that funds in the system, or employment, will materially fall.  We are hopeful that thesector is finding a base from which it can grow.If we are not in the money-hiding business, what business is this sector pursuing?  In a few cases ourlicensees have highly specific business strategies, but the more general approach is preserving privatewealth, increasingly focused on Latin American clients.This suggests that if The Bahamas wishes to preserve and grow its international banking and trustsector—and we do—both the public and private sectors will need to consider how best to become andretain theWesternHemisphere’s jurisdiction of choice for private wealth preservation.0200400600800100012001400201220132014201520162017Chart 4: International Banks: EmploymentHome supervisedHost supervisedSource: Central Bank of The Bahamas
8In following this strategy, we will need to continue grappling with AML and to a lesser extent CFT issues.It is obviously the case that there is dirty money in Latin America.But it is equally obvious that there areclean businesses and investors in Latin America, and in most cases they would be well-advised to keepsome of their family wealth offshore.  The Bahamas needs to be the natural placewhereclean moneyfrom clean clients finds a home.Maintaining a substantial international banking and trust industry in The Bahamas materiallycomplicates our efforts to improve our jurisdiction’s international reputation for AML/CFT riskmanagement.  Those who arbitrate such mattersgloballyconsider that private banking in smallpopulation centres such as Nassau is an automatically high risk business.We are increasingly forming the view, contrary to this conventional wisdom, that properly regulated andsupervised international banking and trust business need not be high risk in AML terms.  As ourjurisdiction has dispensed with money in hiding, and concentrated on money needing more activeservices,what has become clear tous is the following:a)First, that supervised financialinstitutions know their remaining customers closely;b)Second, that not only customers but funds and transactions are scrutinized at the individuallevel; andc)Finally, that the typical client is performing around one transaction per month, so this is not ahigh volume proposition.At this point we are still in transition, and our supervisors and examiners have identified a considerablelist of improvements necessary in the industry.  But nothing about this list and our other supervisoryfindings suggest thatthe Bahamian international sector is irremediably high risk.  We are rather more ofthe view that, given anotheroneto two years of newly intense supervision, under considerablyimproved regulation, this sector will become solidly medium risk. We look forward to industry’scooperation in achieving this outcome, and in helping to demonstrate this outcome to the world’s AMLrisk arbiters.Sovereign AMLRatingsAgenciesSpeaking of AML risk arbiters, the Central Bank has identified six providers of AML sovereign risk ratings.The first and most extensive of these is the Financial Action Task Force and its nine regional affiliates—most relevantly in our case the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force.  Second and most accidentally, wehave the U.S. State Department’s INCSRVolume II, which is an annual list of so-called high-riskjurisdictions. In spots three to six, we have four subscription based services, which operate on verysimilar weighted index approaches.The Central Bank’s AML Analytics team maintainsa watching brief on all six of these ratings, particularlyas regards The Bahamas.  We are normally rated towards the high risk end of the spectrum, but in thisspace there is a strong bias towards high risk weightings.Let’s look at each ratingsprovider.First, the FATF, which helpfully provides comparisons for all countries it has assessed through mutualevaluation reports.  There are in fact two ratings: a compliance
9rating based upon 40 technical assessments, and an effectiveness rating based upon11 judgementcategories.  All 51 of these sub-ratings are based upon a four step scale.  There is no official method toconvert these 51 ratings into one or two aggregate ratings, but it is easy and common for interestedparties to perform this conversionthemselves.Thecurrent position of The Bahamas against about 50 other recently FATF-rated countries is show onthenextslide.  Thehorizontal axisgives our position on technical compliance, and theverticalaxis ourposition on effectiveness.  In theseratings small numbers are better than big numbers, and it can beseen see that The Bahamas is in the middling group, but at the less good end of that group, particularlyon the effectiveness rating.Chart 5: FATF Fourth Round Evaluation RankingsSource:FATFNearly all of you would be aware that the CFATF issued the Bahamian ratings in 2017, but anotherexercise isin progress now, with a new assessment scheduled to be published in a couple of months.We expect that the re-rating will appreciably improve the Bahamian position on this map of relativeAML/CFT strength, as reflected through the FATF ratings universe.Regardless ofhowone feels about the FATF in general and the Bahamian assessment in particular, it isclearly the case that the FATFapproach is:-Credible;-Fully documented;-Reasonably consistent in global application; and-Represents a great deal of work by experienced AML professionals.Only the first of these characteristics applies to the next rating source, theUSState Department’sInternational Narcotics Control Strategy Report(INCSR).  In the absence ofa credible competitor to the
10FATF assessments, many around the world have launched on to this list as the second major source ofsovereign AML risk information.The problem with this approach is that the INCSRis notany sort of rating model.  It is simply a listprepared through the relevant American embassies and coordinated in Washington.  The underlyinganalytic support for this list, we understand, is a single page questionnaire, which is filled out locally, notnecessarily by an AML professional.Our intent is not tocriticise the State Department.  They have never claimed that the INCSR is any sortof AML ratings tool, but it is simply a statutory requirement under relevant American legislation.At any rate, in the INCSR universe, The Bahamas is on the list, as are 75 percent of the countriesconsidered by the State Department.Now we move to the four subscription services: Thomson-Reuters, about which you will hear more latertoday; IBM;the Basel Governance Institute; and KnowYourCountry.com.  All four of these providersdeploy a weighted average approach to risk scoring, within which the FATF and State Departmentassessments are typically the two largest inputs.  Other inputs include items such as global transparency,rule of law, and economic league tables.The Bahamas tends to rate somewhere in the medium to highriskrangewith these four subscriptionservices.  KnowYourCountry, for example, has usasmedium riskand rated 139thout of 219 jurisdictions.The Basel Governance ratingshas usashigh risk, andin theninth out of ten deciles of countries.Why areAML sovereignratings important?  Because, singly and in aggregatethey often form a materialinput into the risk considerations of correspondent banks and others who deal with The Bahamas.  Theeffect is similar to debt ratings agencies: If Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s lists a country as sub-investment grade, it becomes much harder and more expensive to raise funds.  If the AML ratings050100150200250300LowModerateSubstantialHighFrequencyImmediate Outcome RatingChart 6: Distribution of FATF Effectiveness Ratings
11agencies list a country as high AML risk, it becomes harder for that country and its institutions tooperate effectively in the global financial markets.Financial inclusionNow,let’s talk about financial inclusion.“Financial inclusion” is something of a buzz phrase globally, but that hardly detracts from its importance.It is easy to conclude that Bahamian financial inclusion is not nearly as complete as it needs to be.  Ourpopulace isstill notfully banked on either the deposit/transaction or the credit side of the balancesheet.  Our insurance penetration, investments, and pension participation are a long way from whatmight be optimal. Our capital markets are neither largenor liquid in global terms.  Then there is thegeographic issue that inclusion in the Family Islands is in some cases markedly less than in NewProvidence.Neither the Central Bank nor any other agency can fix this on their own, but collectively we can doquitea lot to create a more inclusive Bahamian financial system.  We look forward to providing advice to thegovernment on this point.Financial inclusion is not mainly about AML, but it does generate two distinct AML advantages.  The firstis that cashintensity in the economy will drop, in favor of electronic transactions.  This makes oursociety and economy safer and more efficient, and it makes large and possibly suspect cash transactionseasier to identify.  The second advantage flows indirectly fromthe increased data intensity of thefinancial system.  It will become harder for financial criminals to hide in the undocumented recesses of anon-inclusive system.The Central Bank and other agencies are already progressing a number of financial inclusion initiatives.In our case, these include joining the Alliance for Financial Inclusion, or AFI, and adopting that body’sMaya Declaration.  The AFI has already helpfully created a number of national inclusion benchmarkswhich we can adapt for Bahamian use.  The AFI also provides many case studies, research reports, andother information, which will help us generate ideas for Bahamian financial inclusion.The Central Bank’s digital currency initiative, for which wereceivedexpressions of interestthroughSeptember 15th, is a financial inclusion, AMLand economic efficiency prospect.The returns againstthese metrics will crystallizeat varying paceover time.  It would be fair to saythoughthatthe future ofretail payments appears to be centered on mobile phones rather than cards, and much more so than in-branch bank transactions.The Central Bank’s promotion of a credit bureau, as already noted, should assist in financial inclusion, asBahamian lenders will become more confident that they understand their prospective lendingcustomers.We are shortlisting potential operators of the bureau this month, and planto complete thelicensing process for the successful bidder before the end of 2018.Finally, the Central Bank recently released updated Guidelines for AML/CFT risk management.  Among agreat many other items, these Guidelines have substantially streamlined the documentationrequirements to open a simple B$ bank account.  This will make banking easier for all Bahamians, andalso make banking availableto some of our residents who previously couldn’t open a bank account.
12Where to fromHere?In forecasting the future, it’s important to remember that we know, but can’t predict the timing orincidence, of some major negative shocks.  These include hurricanes, global recessions, and suddenpanics in the international financial and banking markets.  What we can assert, however, is that TheBahamas is not yet as well positioned for these shocks as we would like to be, or as we intend to be.Most obviously in the context of this conference, The Bahamas has become, and will continue tobecome, a more robust jurisdiction in managing AML/CFT risks.  This has direct benefits in discouragingcriminality, corruption, and terrorism, and large indirect benefits in givingthe world’s major financialmarkets and institutions the confidence to deal with us on good terms.Improved financial inclusion will also lead to improved resilience.  Our banking system will becomebigger and safer.  There is the prospect for our insurance, funds management, and pension industries togrow, which creates better risk pooling and a larger pool of long term investable funds for The Bahamas.Outside the sphere of this conference, we see the Bahamian Government and associated partiesundertaking many initiatives to reduce societal risk.We are a small country facing a somewhat uncertain future.  Provided we manage our risks sensibly andproactively, however, I am confident that The Bahamas can aspire to a great future.  Part of that greatfuture involves a Bahamian jurisdiction that both is andis acceptedas sound in managing its AML andCFT risks.Thank you for your attention today.
   The Banking Crisis – A Decade On  Introduction Good evening ladies and gentlemen.  I am grateful to Trinity College Dublin for the invitation to be here today at this important event, ten years on from the onset of the banking crisis in Ireland.i   “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it"ii is a well-known, albeit ironically often forgotten, wisdom. There is a strong argument that the past was forgotten leading up to the crisis, including with the misconception that the great moderation had led to permanent reduction in business cycle fluctuations.  Given the costs and human misery the crisis has caused in Ireland, it would be inexcusable were this to happen again.  So today, in my brief remarks, I will spend a small amount of time on the causes of the crisis, before discussing the crisis itself, what has changed as a result and conclude by looking to the future.    The causes of the crisis 10 years ago, almost exactly to today, New York Federal Reserve economists’ analysis of the US economy (prepared for the setting of interest rates), noted that “Falling real estate prices and rising defaults on home mortgages had caused stresses in financial markets and the economy….  However, the analysis concluded that these problems would be contained.”iii Just five days later, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy.  The rest, as they say, is history. I cite this analysis not to criticise the Fed, but as just one example of the international failures to understand the strength of the gathering storm clouds, notwithstanding their proximity.     Problems had started to crystallise in 2007, and accelerated in 2008, particularly post Lehmans, as market participants retreated towards safe assets. This tendency was intensified 
   The Banking Crisis – A Decade On  by the complexity and lack of transparency in the financial system. In other words, due to the complexity of the market, participants could not establish with confidence which risks would end up with whom and how they might be exposed to the ultimate holder of certain types of risks. Consequently, the market moved away from many higher risks. This included Irish banks with their large property exposures. The move away from the higher risks due to concerns about solvency took the form of a withdrawal of short-term liquidity, leading to the failure of the Irish banks and many others.   It is obvious now that these storm clouds did not arise from a single cause. A recent Bank of England Staff Working paperiv noted the following as contributing factors to the global financial crisis:    Inadequate or flawed regulation, supervision or both;  Underestimation of the riskiness of securities created with financial engineering;  Bad incentives;   Excessive funding of long term assets with short-term liabilities;  Ratings agencies failures;  Flawed assumptions regarding house prices;  Elevated household debt;  A belief by bankers that their institutions were too big to fail;  Global imbalances;  Financial assets accounting; and  Too loose monetary policy.  It is a long list!  Across the globe, “financial innovation….vastly outpaced regulation and supervision…. Financial institutions went on a frenzy of reckless risk-taking…. [relying] more on short-term funding, dramatically lowering lending standardsv.” 
   The Banking Crisis – A Decade On   Many of these failures are clearly relevant to the catastrophic impacts of the financial crisis in Ireland too. They have been well covered in various reportsvi, including the Honohan Reportvii, which presented five root causes specific to the collapse of the Irish banking system:  Macroeconomic and budgetary policies that contributed to the economic overheating, and which relied to an unsustainable extent on the construction sector and other transient sources for Government revenue;  Comprehensive failure of bank management to maintain safe and sound banking practices;  A regulatory approach which was too deferential and accommodating, insufficiently challenging and not persistent enough;  An under-resourced approach to bank supervision that, by relying on governance and risk-management procedures, neglected quantitative assessment and the need to ensure there was sufficient capital to absorb the growing property-related risks; and  An unwillingness to take on board sufficiently the real risk of a looming problem and act with sufficient decisiveness and force to head it off in time.  In other words, a myriad of decisions both large and small, including decisions not to act (inaction bias), all underpinned by implicit and explicit assumptions, led to the global financial crisis and how catastrophic its effects were in Ireland.  There is also a strong argument that Ireland, as a small and open economy, was and is more susceptible to the economic cycle and is likely to experience more froth in the good times and is at greater risk of severe downturns than larger, less open economies.    
   The Banking Crisis – A Decade On  Results of the crisis As is well documented, Ireland experienced a credit-fuelled property bubble, which inflated both residential and commercial prices, driving individual indebtedness, reducing overall competitiveness and encouraging an over reliance on property based taxes in the years from 2003 to 2008viii.  Asset bubbles are at least 380 years old. This time, in Ireland (and elsewhere) it happened to be property related and not tulips, trade in the ‘South Seas’ or dot.com companies.    When confidence evaporated, there was no soft landing. The effects of plummeting property prices quickly spilled over to the rest of the economy, caused distress and difficulties for borrowers, hurt savers (including through the loss of value of supposedly ‘safe’ bank shares), and severely weakened the country’s fiscal position.   In response, a process of fiscal adjustment and banking sector support began in 2008. This included a guarantee of liabilities in the banking sector; a series of pro-cyclical, contractionary budgets; and capital injections into the domestic banks. By late 2010, Ireland’s fiscal position was unsustainable. The government agreed to enter an EU IMF support programme, with a total size of €85bn. The resulting adjustment programme brought additional contractionary budgets (albeit they would have had to be even more austere if Ireland had had to raise market-based funding, compared to cheaper, three-year official funding), public sector pay cuts, further banking stress tests, and more capital injections.   The associated human cost of this was immense. The effects are still being felt today by too many – such as those still directly affected by high levels of personal debt and indirectly by, for example, the dysfunction that still exists in the housing market. The emergency brake applied to housing construction in 2008, is still being felt acutely today. Post the onset of the 
   The Banking Crisis – A Decade On  crisis, the housing stock in Ireland flat-lined at just over two million homesix. That is an increase of just 8,800 between 2011 and 2016, compared to an increase of more than half a million in the first decade of the 2000s, and c.74,000 in 2007 alonex. The consequences of this particular effect of the lack of resilience in the system took a while to work through; non-performing loans emerged much more quickly.   10 years on from the onset of the crisis, and five years since their peak, non-performing loans (NPLs) in Ireland are still a cause of considerable distress to borrowers and vulnerabilities in the banking system. But that is not to say that there has not been considerable progress.   NPLs in the Irish retail banking system declined from €85bn in 2013 to c.€25bn by the end of 2017xi. Importantly, loan “cure” (the return of previously defaulted balances to performing loan status) has been the key driver of NPL reduction in the residential mortgage segment, particularly for owner occupier mortgages, where loan restructuring has played such a pivotal role.xii In contrast, liquidations, write-offs, and sales account for a large majority of the NPL reduction in the commercial real estate segment.  This is illustrated by approximately one in six (116,010)xiii of all owner-occupier loans currently in existence having had some form of restructure.  87% of these loans were meeting the terms of this restructure, and 79% of them are no longer in arrears. This has been achieved through the hard work and sacrifices of those borrowers in distress that have engaged, the pressure and the requirements of the Central Bank (including that repossession can only be pursued as a last resort), and the actions of the banks, all underpinned by economic growth.  Unfortunately, significant problems remain. At the end of June 2018, c.46,000 accounts were in arrears greater than 90 days. The outstanding balance on all lenders’ owner occupier 
   The Banking Crisis – A Decade On  mortgage accounts in arrears of more than 90 days was €9.5 billion, equivalent to c.10 per cent of the total outstanding balance on all owner occupier mortgage accounts.  Accounts over 720 days past due constituted 42 per cent of all accounts in arrears, and at €2.5 billion, represent 91 per cent of arrears balances outstanding.  This matters because behind each account in arrears there is distress and, in the case of PDH loans, the vulnerability of borrowers at risk of losing their home.  This is why there are a significant number of protections and supports for consumers facing mortgage arrears.   Within the remit of the Central Bank’s responsibilities, the approach to mortgage arrears resolution is focused on ensuring the fair treatment of borrowers through a strong consumer protection framework while ensuring banks are sufficiently capitalised, hold appropriately conservative provisions, and have appropriate arrears resolution strategies and operations in place.  This includes regulatory requirements such as the Consumer Protection Code and The Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA), which govern how lenders interact with retail borrowers that are in distress. Firms must also follow the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) when dealing with borrowers facing arrears. The MARP process also requires alternative options if a restructure cannot be agreed or was not appropriate.   There is a range of advice and support for those in arrears, including the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS), the national mortgage Arrears Resolution Service (Abhaile) and a Court Mentor service to assist debtors faced with court proceedings.  The Government also introduced the Personal Insolvency Act 2012, which introduced three debt resolution processes: A Debt Relief Notice, A Debt Settlement Arrangement and a Personal Insolvency 
   The Banking Crisis – A Decade On  Arrangement. The Insolvency Service was established in March 2013 as an independent statutory body. The Government also introduced a national mortgage-to-rent scheme. There are also a number of other non-statutory organisations providing assistance to those in mortgage arrears.   However, these protections, safety nets and restructuring options are not going to address the underlying problems if distressed borrowers do not engage with their lenders or the supports that are in place.  In this context, it is noteworthy that:   c.44% of PDH loans that are more than two years past due are more than five years past due;  c.40% of borrowers of PDH loans that are more two years past due are not engaging with their lenders;   more than half of loans that were more than four years past due at the end of 2016, were more than five years past due at the end of 2017; and   more than 70% of mortgages in arrears over five years are not engaging with their banksxiv & xv. Recognising the individual distress these numbers represent, I would again urge anyone in arrears to engage with their lenders and/ or the supports that are available.  Nonetheless, if we, economically and societally, want a functioning mortgage market, where secured lending is priced in a different way to unsecured, then that security must mean somethingxvi and banks, from both a commercial and a financial stability perspective must have a way of dealing with NPLs.    Sales have proved to be controversial, particularly for owner occupier loans.  They are a legitimate and necessary approach for banks to address non-performing mortgage loans.  To date, there has been no material difference in the number of legal proceedings issued between banks and non-banks, as a percentage of total number of accounts in arrearsxvii. It is 
   The Banking Crisis – A Decade On  also important to emphasise that the Central Bank has, with the support of the Oireachtas, ensured that the protections of our Codes of Conduct, including the CCMA, travel with the loans – it is the activity that is regulated, not the ownership.  The regulatory response to the crisis Domestically, much of the decade since 2008 was spent in crisis management mode, including as part of the Troika programme.  A veritable ‘alphabet soup’ of regulations, implementing technical standards, accounting and supervisory policies have been implemented in recent years. The list of acronyms is long and confusing – CRD/ CRR, BRRD, SSMR, MiFID II, EMIR, IFRS9, GDPR, TRIM, PSD2, etc.xviii, but the extensive international regulatory response reflects the international nature of the crisis.   The Central Bank has also undergone significant organisational change in terms of culture, structure, and process. Following the onset of the crisis, including through the enactment of Central Bank Reform Act of 2010, we introduced significant changes to the regulatory framework and our supervisory culture and approach.  This has delivered a more assertive, risk based, outcomes-focused and analytical approach to supervision. Enforcement is now an important tool to effect deterrence, achieve compliance and promote the behaviours we expect. We are committed to the continued and necessary evolution of our regulatory framework, our supervisory approach and our ability to resolve firms as the industry and the risks it presents evolve.   From a prudential perspective, we are aiming for the Irish financial system to be resilient, to be trustworthy and to sustainably serve the needs of the economy and its customers over the 
   The Banking Crisis – A Decade On  long term – including through the economic cycle.  This is delivered by driving regulated financial services firms to: 1. Have sufficient financial resources, including under a plausible but severe stress;  2. Have sustainable business models over the long-term;  3. Be well governed, have appropriate cultures, with effective risk management and control arrangements, and 4. Be able to recover if they get into difficulty, and if they cannot, be resolvable in an orderly manner without significant externalities or taxpayer costs.  Where these objectives are not being met, we are taking action to remediate them.  This remediation continues to address legacy issue, drive improvements and build greater resilience into the system.   The creation of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) in 2014 is also fundamentally important. Its creation reflected the European nature of banking failures and has centralised banking supervision across the Eurozone under the authority of the European Central Bank. It has driven greater consistency and intensity of banking supervision and has started to rebuild confidence in the European banking system – albeit there remains some fragility to it.   If we look back to the ‘light touch’ regulation of yesteryear, while there was an extensive rulebook, there was a catastrophic over reliance on banks, their management and the market as whole to act in a certain way that would avoid the build-up of undue risk. Now 10 years since the onset of the crisis, rules are used to support a more assertive, intrusive, and outcome focused approach to supervision. The construction of today’s system has clearly been driven by the lessons of these last 10 years.   
   The Banking Crisis – A Decade On  Regulation has been successful in improving the safety and soundness of banks and other financial services firms, governance and risk management arrangements, and reducing (but not yet removing) contingent taxpayer liabilities connected with failure. To take one important and tangible example of what this means in the case of the Irish banks, we have demanded increases in the quantity, and quality of capital that banks hold to protect against losses that could be triggered by a negative shock. Overall, the system has over 3.5 times the level of equity to risk weighted assets compared with 2006xix.  Regulation has also driven greater transparency, disclosure and consistency in reporting, and product design and literature.   Notwithstanding the progress, legacy issues remain.  These include the remaining high level of non-performing loans that I referred to earlier, remaining vulnerabilities in some banks’ business models, and capability issues in critical areas, including in IT risk management.  Furthermore, resolution plans are not yet fully implementable, meaning that there is further work to be done to remove implicit taxpayer support for the larger banks.  As we have recently reported, banks also have work to do to improve their cultures and the levels of diversity at senior levelsxx.   This is why we remain focused on both addressing these legacy issues, and building resilience into the system during good times to mitigate the effects of the inevitable future downturns and shocks.  This is particularly important in the context of Ireland’s vulnerability as a small, open, economy, and the risks of which I referred to earlier.   We have also taken forward-looking macro prudential actions, which include:  
   The Banking Crisis – A Decade On   The activation of the counter-cyclical capital buffer, which is designed to build resilience during times of growth, and so that it can be released during a downturn, avoiding the pro-cyclical withdrawal of credit supply;   The introduction of borrower-based measures that limit loan-to-value and loan-to-income ratios, which increase the resilience in the system and reduce the risk credit-fuelled property bubbles from over-borrowing and over-lending; and  Advice to government regarding the need for running budget surpluses as a precondition for the running of stabilising, counter-cyclical deficits in a future downturn. If surpluses are not built up we increase the risk of requiring pro-cyclical fiscal austerity policies.xxi  My colleague, Sharon Donnery, Deputy Governor, Central Banking, will speak more on these macro prudential measures in her remarks at the Dublin Economics Workshop on 14 September, so I will not discuss in detail here today.   We are also seeking to ensure that the financial services industry pays the direct costs of these necessary enhancements to regulation and supervision. Over the coming years we are aiming to increase the levy paid by regulated entities to 100% of our regulatory costs.  Looking Ahead The Irish financial system, and the banking system specifically, is undoubtedly stronger and more resilient that it was 10 years ago.  After many years of contraction, it is also growing again, becoming increasingly complex in nature and increasingly internationally focused, in part due to Brexit.    So, there are grounds for optimism.  However, as I have touched on, weaknesses remain, and as I have also referenced, it is likely that we are closer to the next downturn than we are to 
   The Banking Crisis – A Decade On  the start of the last one. Even as the sun is shining today, there are clouds on the horizon. One can hope that future storms are not as severe as the last one, but storms there undoubtedly will be.    In this context, it is noteworthy that both globally and domestically the levels of debt that characterised the build up to the crisis has not disappeared. In fact, global debt levels are higher now than they were in 2009, reaching the record peak of $164 trillion in 2016 – equivalent to 225 per cent of global GDP. Debt in advanced economies is at levels not seen since the Second World Warxxii.  Closer to home, Ireland’s household and public debt levels, which are key indicators of the economy’s resilience to shocks remain very elevated (Irish households are the fourth most indebted in the European Unionxxiii).  This level of debt clearly increases the vulnerabilities to shocks (including interest rate risk) and limits authorities’ policy options for dealing with them in a counter cyclical way.   These macro risks are significant for Ireland, given the openness of the economy.  These could obviously affect the domestic retail banking system, notwithstanding its increased resilience. Risks also arise at a micro level.  One such risk arises from the increasing dependency on and interconnectedness of information technology, and the need to enhance resilience and mitigate cyber security risks in this area.  I have not discussed in detail today, but it is an area of concern that I will cover in more detail in a speech next month.    Conclusion Building resilience now, for individuals, governments and banks will serve us well for future downturns, whatever the cause may be.  It will also help with the pressing need to restore trust in the system, a foundation of which is that financial institutions are trustworthy.   
   The Banking Crisis – A Decade On  All of the actions taken during the crisis, and the changes made in its aftermath are to support the vital, public interest mission of the Central Bank. That is to safeguard the stability of the financial services system and protect consumers.   My energies are focused on ensuring that the Central Bank has a robust, fit for purpose regulatory framework, and is delivering an effective, intrusive, analytical and outcomes-focused approach to supervision, which remembers the lessons of the past, anticipates future risks, and continuously improves.    My hope is that in 10 years’ time, we will still remember the banking crisis and the lessons from it. But that between now and then we will have navigated the many challenges ahead and more successfully weathered the inevitable shocks that will occur, than we did 10 years ago.  This will require continued diligence, building resilience, a willingness to listen to different voices and challenge the assumptions we are relying on – it is inevitable that not all of them will hold.   With that said, I look forward to hearing the perspectives of my distinguished fellow speakers, answering your questions and hearing your views.

For release on delivery 12:45 p.m. EDT  September 12, 2018         What Do We Mean by Neutral and What Role Does It Play in Monetary Policy?    Remarks by  Lael Brainard  Member  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  at the  Detroit Economic Club   Detroit, Michigan        September 12, 2018  
 It is a pleasure to be in Detroit.  I started my career working here in the Motor City, and I have followed the fortunes of this area with interest ever since.  A few years ago, I visited some of Detroit’s neighborhoods with our local officials at a time when damage from the crisis was still pervasive.  While challenges remain in many of the city’s neighborhoods, since that time the metropolitan area overall has seen signs of a rebound in business activity and investment, and the unemployment rate has continued to trend downward, recently falling to 4.3 percent.1 This is similar to the nation’s economy more broadly.  While challenges remain for many, aggregate growth is strong, and the economy is meeting our full employment and inflation objectives.  Given the outlook, it comes as no surprise that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has been gradually raising interest rates from crisis-era lows and sees further gradual increases as likely to be appropriate in its most recent statement.2  Before discussing the outlook, it might be useful to first explore some concepts that are important in informing the path of rates.    What Is the Neutral Rate of Interest? In thinking about how we should set the federal funds rate, many policymakers and economists find the concept of the neutral rate of interest to be a useful frame of reference.  So, what does the neutral rate mean?  Intuitively, I think of the nominal neutral interest rate as the level of the federal funds rate that keeps output growing around its potential rate in an environment of full employment and stable inflation.3                                                      1 I am grateful to John Roberts of the Federal Reserve Board for his assistance in preparing this text.  These remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee. 2 See Board of Governors (2018a). 3 The closely related concept of the natural rate of interest--the rate of interest at which investment and savings are equilibrated at full employment--is originally attributed to Swedish economist Knut Wicksell. 
 - 2 - Focusing first on the “shorter-run” neutral rate, this does not stay fixed, but rather fluctuates along with important changes in economic conditions.  For instance, legislation that increases the budget deficit through tax cuts and spending increases can be expected to generate tailwinds to domestic demand and thus to push up the shorter-run neutral interest rate.  Heightened risk appetite among investors similarly can be expected to push up the shorter-run neutral rate.  Conversely, many of the forces that contributed to the financial crisis--such as fear and uncertainty on the part of businesses and households--can be expected to lower the neutral rate of interest, as can declines in foreign demand for U.S. exports. In many circumstances, monetary policy can help keep the economy on its sustainable path at full employment by adjusting the policy rate to reflect movements in the shorter-run neutral rate.  In this context, the appropriate reference for assessing the stance of monetary policy is the gap between the policy rate and the nominal shorter-run neutral rate.   So far, I have been focusing on the shorter-run neutral rate of interest that is responsive to headwinds or tailwinds to demand.  The longer-run equilibrium rate is a related concept.  The underlying concept of the “longer run” generally refers to the output growing at its longer-run trend, after transitory forces reflecting headwinds or tailwinds have played out, in an environment of full employment and inflation running at the FOMC objective.4                                                      The natural rate and the neutral rate are closely related concepts whose technical differences matter for economic theory and estimation, but less for the intuitive discussion here. 4 See Brainard (2015). 
 - 3 - The longer-run federal funds rate estimated by FOMC participants in their Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) meets the definition of a longer-run equilibrium rate of interest.5  It is worth highlighting that the longer-run federal funds rate is the only neutral interest rate reported in the FOMC projections.  But the shorter-run neutral rate, rather than the longer-run federal funds rate, is the relevant benchmark for assessing the near-term path of monetary policy in the presence of headwinds or tailwinds.   Estimating the Neutral Rate of Interest Similar to other equilibrium macroeconomic concepts such as potential gross domestic product (GDP) and the natural rate of unemployment, the shorter- and longer-run levels of the neutral rate are not directly observable, so they must be estimated or inferred from the movements of variables that are observed, such as market interest rates, inflation, the unemployment rate, and GDP.6  In recent years, considerable work has derived estimates of the longer-run equilibrium rate, in some cases using statistical techniques that can be thought of as capturing the highly persistent component of the neutral rate.  The central tendency of those estimates suggests that the longer-run trend rate is in the range of 2.5 to 3.5 percent in nominal terms.7  This range lines up well with the most recent median estimate of the longer-run federal funds rate in the FOMC SEP,                                                    5 As defined in the FOMC SEP, “Longer-run projections represent each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.”  See the most recent SEP, an addendum to the minutes of the June 2018 FOMC meeting, available in a July 5, 2018, press release on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20180705a.htm. 6 See Powell (2018). 7 See Kiley (2015); Johannsen and Mertens (2016); Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2017); Laubach and Williams (2003) (current estimates available on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s website at https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/economists/williams/data/Laubach_Williams_current_estimates.xlsx); Lewis and Vazquez-Grande (2017); and Lubik and Matthes (2015). 
 - 4 - which is just below 3 percent.  By these estimates, the longer-run neutral rate has fallen considerably from the estimated range in earlier decades of 4 to 5 percent.8  Turning to the shorter-run neutral rate, although the estimates are model dependent and uncertain, we can make some general inferences about its recent evolution that are largely independent of the details of specific models.9  Estimates suggest the shorter-run neutral rate tends to be cyclical, falling in recessions and rising during expansions, and our current expansion appears to be no exception.10   Last year, the unemployment rate returned to pre-crisis levels, which required real interest rates that were below zero for nearly 10 years.11  This year, the unemployment rate has fallen further, and job market gains have gathered strength, at the same time that the federal funds rate has increased.  This combination suggests that the short-run neutral interest rate likely has also increased.  If, instead, the neutral rate had remained constant as the federal funds rate increased, we would have expected to see labor market gains slow.  That inference is consistent with the formal model estimates, which indicate that the shorter-run neutral rate has gone up as the expansion has advanced.  This is also suggested by the observation that overall financial conditions, as measured by a variety of indexes, have remained quite accommodative during a period when the federal funds rate has been moving higher.   In the latest FOMC SEP median path, by the end of next year, the federal funds rate is projected to rise to a level that exceeds the longer-run federal funds rate during a                                                    8 A variety of hypotheses have been advanced to explain this decline, including slower labor force growth, slower productivity growth, and an increase in savings propensities.  See Kiley (2015) and Brainard (2015). 9 Estimates of real natural rates of interest based on dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models include Del Negro and others (2015) and Edge, Kiley, and Laforte (2008). 10 See, for example, Cúrdia (2015) and Del Negro and others (2015). 11 See Yellen (2015, 2016, 2017).   
 - 5 - time when real GDP growth is projected to exceed its longer-run pace and unemployment continues to fall. The shift from headwinds to tailwinds may be expected to push the shorter-run neutral rate above its longer-run trend in the next year or two, just as it fell below the longer-run equilibrium rate following the financial crisis.  Notably, the sizable fiscal stimulus in the pipeline is likely to continue to bolster the short-run neutral rate over the next two years.  The relatively rich level of current asset valuations relative to historical levels is another factor that could push the short-run neutral rate above its longer-run value.  As was noted in the recent FOMC minutes, corporate credit spreads are very narrow, and equity valuations are elevated relative to historical patterns, even after taking into account the low level of interest rates.12  Business and consumer confidence is high, which is also consistent with a higher shorter-run neutral rate of interest. The Outlook Having provided some context for how we might assess policy, I will turn to some observations on the outlook.  By any measure, overall growth in the second quarter was strong.  Real GDP increased at a 4-1/4 percent annual rate, a very rapid pace nine years into the expansion.  Looking ahead, it seems likely that growth will remain solid.  Confidence is high, private domestic demand momentum is solid, and recent fiscal stimulus will continue to work its way through the economy, at least for the next year or so. The labor market is also strong.  So far this year, payroll gains have averaged more than 200,000 per month, a step-up from the 2017 pace and well above estimates of the pace necessary to absorb new entrants into the labor force.  Among prime-age                                                    12 See Board of Governors (2018b).  
 - 6 - workers, the employment-to-population ratio is 79.3 percent, up almost 1 percentage point over the past year.  These developments are heartening, suggesting the tight labor market is providing employment opportunities to more Americans.  Nonetheless, this is still about 1 percentage point below its previous cyclical peak, suggesting there may be some room for further gains.   In another encouraging development, wage gains in the August report reached their highest level since the depth of the financial crisis, although wage growth remains moderate by historical standards.  While a variety of wage measures have accelerated over the past year and there is anecdotal evidence of worker shortages in some sectors and regions, there is no evidence of rapid acceleration in the aggregate wage indicators.  At 3.9 percent, the August unemployment rate was about 1/2 percentage point lower than the previous year.  If unemployment continues to decline at the same rate as we have seen over the past year, we will soon see unemployment rates not seen since the 1960s.  Historically, the few periods when resource utilization has been at similarly tight levels have tended to see elevated risks of either accelerating inflation or financial imbalances.13  For instance, the inflation process may change in unexpected ways.   So far, the data on inflation remain encouraging, providing little signal of an outbreak of inflation to the upside, on the one hand, and some reassurance that underlying trend inflation may be moving closer to 2 percent, on the other.  Core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices have increased 2 percent over the past 12 months, consistent with the FOMC’s objective.  Survey measures of inflation expectations remain stable in the lower end of the historical ranges, while market-based                                                    13 See Brainard (2018). 
 - 7 - measures of inflation compensation remain stable at levels above the lows seen in 2016. With various measures of underlying trend inflation having come in below our 2 percent objective over a sustained period, it is important to sustainably achieve inflation around 2 percent to prevent an erosion of underlying trend inflation the next time the economy faces a downturn and the federal funds rate hits its lower limit.14   The past few times unemployment fell to levels as low as those projected over the next year, signs of overheating showed up in financial-sector imbalances rather than in accelerating inflation.  The Federal Reserve’s assessment suggests that financial vulnerabilities are building, which might be expected after a long period of economic expansion and very low interest rates.  Rising risks are notable in the corporate sector, where low spreads and loosening credit terms are mirrored by rising indebtedness among corporations that could be vulnerable to downgrades in the event of unexpected adverse developments.  Leveraged lending is again on the rise; spreads on leveraged loans and the securitized products backed by those loans are low, and the Board’s Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices suggests that underwriting standards for leveraged loans may be declining to levels not seen since 2005. While tightening resource utilization and loose financial conditions present upside risks, recent foreign developments present downside risks.  Trade policy has introduced uncertainty.  Growth in Europe and Japan has moderated from its strong pace of last year, and political risks have reemerged in countries such as Italy.  China is contending with deleveraging and deceleration as well as a challenging trade environment.  As U.S. growth has pulled away from foreign growth, in part reflecting fiscal policy divergence,                                                    14 See Brainard (2017). 
 - 8 - expectations of monetary policy divergence strengthened, contributing to upward pressure on the dollar earlier this year.  The resulting currency adjustments are compounding challenges faced by some emerging market economies, along with a complicated and unpredictable trade environment and gradually increasing interest rates. Although capital flow reversals have been contained to several notably vulnerable countries so far, I am attentive to the risk that a pullback from emerging markets could broaden.   The Path of Policy What are the implications for policy?  Over the next year or two, barring unexpected developments, continued gradual increases in the federal funds rate are likely to be appropriate to sustain full employment and inflation near its objective.  With government stimulus in the pipeline providing tailwinds to demand over the next two years, it appears reasonable to expect the shorter-run neutral rate to rise somewhat higher than the longer-run neutral rate.  Further out, the policy path will depend on how the economy evolves. These developments raise the prospect that, at some point, the Committee’s setting of the federal funds rate will exceed current estimates of the longer-run federal funds rate.  Indeed, the median projection in the SEP has this property.  This raises the possibility of a flattening or inversion of the yield curve in the event that term premiums do not rise from their currently very low levels.15                                                      15 The standard expectations hypothesis model decomposes longer-term interest rates into a component that represents the influence of expectations of future short-term interest rates and a “term premium.”  Most estimates of the term premium, which are model-based, suggest that term premiums have been very low recently, and some suggest that term premiums are roughly zero across the yield curve.  If term premiums remain low and stable, the component associated with expectations of future short-term interest rates will dominate movements in long-term interest rates. 
 - 9 - Like many of you, I am attentive to the historical observation that inversions of the yield curve between the 3-month and 10-year Treasury rates have had a relatively reliable track record of preceding recessions in the United States.16  But unlike these historical episodes, today the current 10-year yield is very low at around 3 percent, which is well below the average of 6-1/4 percent during the decades before the crisis.   Part of the reason the 10-year Treasury yield is unusually low is that market expectations of interest rates in the longer run are themselves quite low, as discussed earlier.  Another important reason the 10-year Treasury yield is very low is that the term premium has fallen to levels that are very low by historical standards.  According to one estimate from Federal Reserve staff, the term premium has been slightly negative until very recently and remains very low.17  By contrast, it was close to 100 basis points when the spread between the 3-month and 10-year Treasury yields was at its peak of 325 basis points in early 2010.  This may temper somewhat the conclusions that we can draw from historical yield curve relationships characterized by a substantially higher term premium.  If the term premium remains very low, any given amount of monetary policy tightening will lead to an inversion sooner so that even a modest tightening that might not have led to an inversion historically could do so today. One reason the term premium may be lower than in the past is the changed correlation between stock and bond returns, likely associated with changes in expected inflation outcomes.18  The other driver of the low level of the term premium globally is                                                    16 See Estrella and Mishkin (1997); Johansson and Meldrum (2018); and Favara and others (2016) for more recent analysis. 17 See Kim and Wright (2005).  The latest update is available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/researchdata/feds200533.xls. 18 See Chen, Engstrom, and Grishchenko (2016). 
 - 10 - the asset purchases of central banks in several major economies.19  In this case, if the term premium rises as the effect of asset purchase programs diminishes, the effect may be to forestall an inversion of the long-dated yield curve.   It is worth highlighting that the flattening yield curve suggested by the SEP median is associated with a policy path calibrated to sustain full employment and inflation around target.  So, while I will keep a close watch on the yield curve as an important signal on financial conditions, I will want to interpret yield curve movements as one of several considerations informing appropriate policy. Indeed, the possibility that the projected policy path may have unintended consequences is one of the compelling reasons for raising interest rates gradually.  The gradual pace of interest rate increases anticipated in the SEP median path should give us some time to assess the effects of our policies as we proceed.   While the information available to us today suggests that a gradual path is appropriate, we would not hesitate to act decisively if circumstances were to change.  If, for example, underlying inflation were to move abruptly and unexpectedly higher, it might be appropriate to depart from the gradual path.  Stable inflation expectations is one of the key achievements of central banks in the past several decades, and we would defend it vigorously. Conclusion Our challenge is to sustain full employment and inflation at 2 percent, which is likely to warrant continued gradual increases in the federal funds rate.  With fiscal stimulus in the pipeline and financial conditions supportive of growth, the shorter-run                                                    19 See, for example, Li and Wei (2013); Curcuru, De Pooter, and Eckerd (2018); and Curcuru and others (2018). 
 - 11 - neutral interest rate is likely to move up somewhat further, and it may well surpass the longer-run equilibrium rate for some period.  Beyond the near term, how much the neutral rate is likely to rise and whether it flattens or moderates further out will depend on a variety of developments--such as whether fiscal stimulus is extended or expires, whether foreign and trade risks grow or recede, and whether financial system vulnerabilities extend.  As such, the gradual pace of rate increases implicit in the SEP’s median policy path incorporates a degree of caution, which is appropriate, in my view.

Mario Draghi: ECB press conference - introductory statementIntroductory statement by Mr Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, and Mr Luisde Guindos, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, Frankfurt am Main, 13 September2018.*   *   *Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our pressconference. We will now report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the Governing Council,which was also attended by the Commission Vice-President, Mr Dombrovskis.Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECBinterest rates unchanged. We continue to expect them to remain at their present levels at leastthrough the summer of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continuedsustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the mediumterm.Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, we will continue to make net purchasesunder the asset purchase programme (APP) at the current monthly pace of €30 billion until theend of this month. After September 2018, we will reduce the monthly pace of the net assetpurchases to €15 billion until the end of December 2018 and we anticipate that, subject toincoming data confirming our medium-term inflation outlook, we will then end net purchases. Weintend to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP foran extended period of time after the end of our net asset purchases, and in any case for as longas necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetaryaccommodation.The incoming information, including our new September 2018 staff projections, broadly confirmsour previous assessment of an ongoing broad-based expansion of the euro area economy andgradually rising inflation. The underlying strength of the economy continues to support ourconfidence that the sustained convergence of inflation to our aim will proceed and will bemaintained even after a gradual winding-down of our net asset purchases. At the same time,uncertainties relating to rising protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financialmarket volatility have gained more prominence recently. Significant monetary policy stimulus isstill needed to support the further build-up of domestic price pressures and headline inflationdevelopments over the medium term. This support will continue to be provided by the net assetpurchases until the end of the year, by the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the associatedreinvestments, and by our enhanced forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates. In anyevent, the Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments as appropriate toensure that inflation continues to move towards the Governing Council’s inflation aim in asustained manner.Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euroarea real GDP increased by 0.4%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2018, followinggrowth at the same rate in the previous quarter. Despite some moderation following the stronggrowth performance in 2017, the latest economic indicators and survey results overall confirmongoing broad-based growth of the euro area economy. Our monetary policy measures continueto underpin domestic demand. Private consumption is supported by ongoing employment gains,which, in turn, partly reflect past labour market reforms, and by rising wages. Businessinvestment is fostered by the favourable financing conditions, rising corporate profitability andsolid demand. Housing investment remains robust. In addition, the expansion in global activity isexpected to continue, supporting euro area exports.This assessment is broadly reflected in the September 2018 ECB staff macroeconomic 1 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
projections for the euro area. These projections foresee annual real GDP increasing by 2.0% in2018, 1.8% in 2019 and 1.7% in 2020. Compared with the June 2018 Eurosystem staffmacroeconomic projections, the outlook for real GDP growth has been revised down slightly for2018 and 2019, mainly due to a somewhat weaker contribution from foreign demand.The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook can still be assessed as broadly balanced. Atthe same time, risks relating to rising protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets andfinancial market volatility have gained more prominence recently.According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was 2.0% in August 2018,down from 2.1% in July. On the basis of current futures prices for oil, annual rates of headlineinflation are likely to hover around the current level for the remainder of the year. While measuresof underlying inflation remain generally muted, they have been increasing from earlier lows.Domestic cost pressures are strengthening and broadening amid high levels of capacityutilisation and tightening labour markets, which is pushing up wage growth. Uncertainty aroundthe inflation outlook is receding. Looking ahead, underlying inflation is expected to pick uptowards the end of the year and thereafter to increase gradually over the medium term,supported by our monetary policy measures, the continuing economic expansion and risingwage growth.This assessment is also broadly reflected in the September 2018 ECB staff macroeconomicprojections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation at 1.7% in 2018, 2019 and2020, which is unchanged from the June 2018 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections.Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) growth declined to 4.0% in July 2018, from4.5% in June. Apart from some volatility in monthly flows, M3 growth is increasingly supported bybank credit creation. The narrow monetary aggregate M1 remained the main contributor to broadmoney growth.The recovery in the growth of loans to the private sector observed since the beginning of 2014 isproceeding. The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations stood at 4.1% in July2018, while the annual growth rate of loans to households stood at 3.0%, both unchanged fromJune.The pass-through of the monetary policy measures put in place since June 2014 continues tosignificantly support borrowing conditions for firms and households, access to financing – inparticular for small and medium-sized enterprises – and credit flows across the euro area.To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals comingfrom the monetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is stillnecessary for the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but closeto, 2% over the medium term.In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas mustcontribute more decisively to raising the longer-term growth potential and reducing vulnerabilities.The implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries needs to be substantiallystepped up to increase resilience, reduce structural unemployment and boost euro areaproductivity and growth potential. Regarding fiscal policies, the broad-based expansion calls forrebuilding fiscal buffers. This is particularly important in countries where government debt is highand for which full adherence to the Stability and Growth Pact is critical for safeguarding soundfiscal positions. Likewise, the transparent and consistent implementation of the EU’s fiscal andeconomic governance framework over time and across countries remains essential to bolsterthe resilience of the euro area economy. Improving the functioning of Economic and MonetaryUnion remains a priority. The Governing Council urges specific and decisive steps to completethe banking union and the capital markets union. 2 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches

Joachim Wuermeling: International cooperation in financialregulation - between myth and realitySpeech by Prof Joachim Wuermeling, Member of the Executive Board of the DeutscheBundesbank, at a reception to welcome the new chief representative of Deutsche Bundesbank’sNew York office Gabriele Kabelac and to bid farewell to Dr Claudia Stirböck, New York City, 11September 2018.*   *   *1 IntroductionLadies and gentlemen,It is wonderful to be back in New York City, a city so rich in American and international flair.We are here today to welcome the Bundesbank’s new chief representative, Gabriele Kabelac.For us at the Bundesbank, this event is much more than a simple changeover – it symbolisesthe importance of our transatlantic partnership and friendship.But tonight is also the final night of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year. Rosh Hashanah, Ilearned, is also referred to as the Day of Remembrance. It requires an “accounting of the soul", adeep reflection on the past year.Before coming here, I reflected not only on my personal year, but also on the political year behindus. I thought, for instance, about the still-looming trade war and its possible repercussions oneconomic growth throughout the world. But I also thought about the negotiations over finalisingBasel III – which have been completed, thankfully, but were difficult, quite frankly – and thederegulation debate. It became clear to me that the values of international cooperation andmultilateral alliances are being visibly threatened by growing political tensions within our nationsas well as between them.I have reflected then on what would be necessary to enter into a healthier new year for ourtransatlantic friendship and for international cooperation. Let me make a few remarks about what– in my opinion – won’t work and what can work. I will focus on banking and financial supervision,my main responsibility as a member of the Bundesbank’s Executive Board.2 The illusion of national sovereigntyThe first approach that won’t work is in my opinion the illusion of national sovereignty. Thismeans the idea that – as the Brexit cheerleaders led the British people to believe – if you pull yourcountry out of the web of international agreements, you can go it alone and even be better off.Unfortunately, reality has been demonstrating how much of a myth that is. Regarding Brexit,many people in the UK are only now beginning to realise how dependent their economy has beenand still is on EU membership. Many problems became only obvious during the exit negotiations– most of which were never an issue during the leave campaign.I think that compartmentalisation helping the national economy is a dangerous illusion whichdoes not provide substantial solutions to serious challenges. There has never been such amythological nation-state, and it certainly doesn’t exist in the era of the internet, smartphones andmass air travel.What then is sovereignty in the 21st century? It is the capacity to decide rationally about wherecooperation is, on balance, better than going it alone, even if it entails unpleasant compromises. 1 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
3 The rationale for international cooperation in financial regulationFollowing that, it seems reasonable to approach many areas of the economy in an internationallycooperative, rules-based manner. Financial regulation, in my opinion, continues to be one areaconducive to this approach, as we want to prevent a regulatory race to the bottom and to ensurefair competition, i.e. a level playing field.It was in that spirit that the G 20, led by the United States, spearheaded the efforts to tackle thefinancial crisis.The G 20 efforts have created a rational, viable approach to international cooperation that is in theinterest of all member states – its principles should therefore remain pillars of the regulation ofinternational finance.It is built on close transatlantic and international cooperation between our central banks and ourregulators and supervisors. It also rests on the joint work in international regulatory fora to fosterour mutual understanding and the common language we have developed over the past thirtyyears.This approach also builds on a whole body of international minimum standards, like the Basel IIIregime for internationally active banks that we have developed over the last ten years. The BaselIII standards have proven to be a success story, as they are the foundation for banking regulationin more than 100 countries.4 The illusion of the global level playing fieldLadies and gentlemen, as we strive to prevent a race to the bottom and maintain a fair, levelplaying field, I am convinced that international, rules-based cooperation is – and should remain –the method of choice not only, but in particular in the area of financial regulation.At the same time, I am less convinced that Basel III is a “one size fits all” approach and thatadherence to international standards makes national supervision redundant. Basel standards areminimum standards that cannot cover each and every national specificity – in these few selectedareas, national authorities need to fil these gaps, and adjust the standards accordingly. Anotherlegitimate, but limited deviation concerns the reduction of administrative burdens for smallerinstitutions – like they are currently pursued in the US and the EU. Further, if a non-EU bank hassubstantial activities in the EU, it should have a consolidated subsidiary that is supervised in thatjurisdiction. An internationally active bank cannot have core capacities of risk management,capital and liquidity only in one spot.We have seen that the Intermediate Holding Corporation laws in the US work quite well; and thesame will be true of the forthcoming EU equivalent, the Intermediate Parent UndertakingRegulation. The subsidiarisation requirement will also enhance the systemic stability of thefinancial ties between the UK and the EU after Brexit. Generally speaking, it is also a usefulbackstop against a regulatory race to the bottom, as it will make it difficult to provide cross-borderservices from less well-regulated locations.So I do understand that in light of Brexit and the end of London’s direct access to the EU singlemarket fears of regulatory fragmentation are worsening and leading to more calls to maintain aglobal level playing field.That’s why the important achievements of non-discrimination against foreign firms on the onehand and the G 20’s minimum standards should be upheld.However, our approach to international cooperation is to make sure that every supervisor canoversee the entities active in its jurisdiction. 2 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
5 ConclusionLadies and gentlemen,Simple answers to complex problems are comforting, but they divert our attention from the realissues.The concept of splendid isolation is a myth; it solves no problems.If the transatlantic partnership and close multilateral cooperation are to be resilient cornerstonesof the world economy, we need rational, careful decision-making, policy case by policy case;where some cases will be better dealt with in the national realm, while others will turn out torequire coordinated or even cooperative approaches.The Bundesbank has a reputation as being principles-oriented – sometimes maybe even toomuch so. We will continue to seek our US partners’ advice and work towards mutually beneficialsolutions, where cooperation is rational and viable.Our New York representative office plays an important role in those efforts, and to end myremarks, I want to introduce four persons who play important roles in furthering cooperation.Let me start with the Executive Board member inter alia responsible for our New York officesince September 1: Burkhard Balz. With twenty years of banking and regulatory experience, hewill be an understanding partner for discussions on any financial topic. And, as a former memberof the European Parliament, he is internationally well connected and speaks the language ofdiplomacy. At the Bundesbank, he will not only be responsible for our representatives abroad –and therefore the New York office – but also for the important area of payment and settlementssystems.We are both grateful for the excellent job that Ms Claudia Stirböck has done over the past fiveyears as our chief representative in New York: she played a vital role in the exchange betweenthe Bundesbank and the Federal Reserve and was instrumental in shaping our understanding ofUS regulatory policy during her tenure. I am pleased that she will continue to apply her broadexpertise back home at the Directorate General Economics in our Central Office.Ms Stirböck leaving our New York office is a loss, but I am confident that Ms Gabriele Kabelac willbe an excellent successor. Coming from our Directorate General Economics, she bringsprofound financial sector knowledge with her. Moreover, with her experience in coordinating theBundesbank’s participation in international forums, she will not only be a highly effective andcreative contact to all of you, but will also be a joy to work with.Our new team now has the honour of welcoming – and I have the pleasure of introducing –tonight’s keynote speaker: Professor Stanley Fischer.What is there to say about a man who has served as Governor of the Central Bank of Israel –where he successfully guided the country through the global financial crisis of 2008 – but alsoVice Chair of the Federal Reserve? And all that after having been the World Bank’s ChiefEconomist, the IMF’s Deputy Managing Director, and Vice Chairman of Citigroup.The most fascinating item, to me, on his CV is that he was professor at the MIT Department ofEconomics, where he was the Ph.D. thesis advisor not only to Ben Bernanke, but also to – youguessed it – Mario Draghi.I have therefore decided to let someone else find the right words: former US President BarackObama. Four years ago, he said that Stanley Fischer would “bring decades of leadership andexpertise” with him, and that he was “widely acknowledged as one of the world’s leading andmost experienced economic policy minds.” I have nothing more to add, and I am honoured to 3 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches

1   ROMANIA: TEN YEARS AFTER THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS Liviu Voinea, Deputy Governor, National Bank of Romania Macroeconomics Panel - 2018 FP Investor Days   Your Excellencies, Dear Guests,  Ten years ago, in mid-September 2008, the Lehman Brothers’ collapse became the trigger of the global financial crisis.   The main cause of the global financial crisis was, in my opinion, excessive deregulation, which fuelled speculative bubbles on many markets, primarily on the derivatives markets comprising mortgages. That crisis has thrown US and EU in the midst of financial turmoil, leading to recession, deflation, and forcing central banks to take unorthodox measures, including quantitative easing, which led to negative real and even nominal interest rates. Since then, US and EU have recovered, but the exit from these unorthodox policies proves to be harder in the EU, particularly because some countries are not better off in terms of public debt than they were before the crisis.   Emerging markets were hit even harder, and their resources for recovery were limited. Everyone felt the wave of the global crisis, but in the case of some emerging markets that was exacerbated by their domestic vulnerabilities. Today, this is more evident than before, when we witness some emerging markets being hit not by a global crisis, but by their      in-built vulnerabilities.   This is why I would like to speak today about the Romanian economy, ten years after the global financial crisis. Are we better off? Are we more protected against contagion risks? Have we put in place stronger prevention mechanisms? Have the IMF/EU 
2  financing agreements paid off? And what remains to be done in order to have our house in order?   Romania itself faced a severe economic downturn which started in the fourth quarter of 2008 and continued until 2011 - first and foremost because of its domestic vulnerabilities. In the year before the crisis, the current account deficit exceeded 13%, the structural deficit was close to 9%, the economic growth was based on consumption of imported goods, and it was driven by loose fiscal policy and by the credit boom based on foreign exchange denominated loans, while the real estate bubble reached unprecedented levels. All that it was needed for a crisis was a sparkle. That sparkle was the global financial crisis, which led to massive speculative capital outflows, although the Vienna Initiative was a useful tool for damage control in this region. The rest is known and I do not want to insist upon it here. The diagnosis that I put in 2009, in my book “The end of illusion economics. Crisis and anti-crisis” is still valid.   Since then, Romania witnessed a decade of major transformations. Under three successive IMF/EU programs, we have made a long way to reform the economy and to make it more resilient to further external shocks. In what follows, I will argue that Romania is now more developed and better equipped to deal with external shocks than it was ten years ago; but risks coming from unwarranted domestic policies remain. My assessment is based on a longer time perspective and it may differ from a year on year approach.  Romania is one of the few success stories of converging within the European Union, even during and after the crisis. GDP per capita at PPS increased from 50.6% of EU average in 2008 to 62.5% in 2017. The real GDP was higher by 17.5% in 2017 as against 2008; and the real potential GDP was 23% higher in 2017 as against 2008 (Figure 1). By the end of 2018, these figures will further grow by approximately 4 percentage points, according to IMF and EC forecasts.   
3  IMF/EU programs from 2009 to 2015 were successful in many ways, contributing to a sharp adjustment in the budget deficit, exit from the Excessive Deficit Procedure in 2013 and reaching the MTO in the period 2013-2015. Structural reforms also advanced during the programs, one indicator of these being the large reduction in public government and state enterprises’ arrears.  Exports of goods and services doubled in the last ten years, from 38.3 billion euro in 2008 to 77.9 billion euro in 2017, while imports increased by only 42.7% over the same period. CPI-based Real effective exchange rate (REER) is also lower than in 2008 (Figure 2). Consequently, the negative contribution of net exports to GDP has diminished, and the current account deficit witnessed a major adjustment of about 10% of GDP.   The net real wage was higher by 42.7% in 2017 as compared to 2008, while the number of employees is also higher by 2.4% in 2017 compared to 2008.  As social contributions and other taxes were reduced, the increase in real wages was only partially mirrored by the increase in compensation of employees. When compared against EU average, labor productivity raised faster than compensation of employees over the entire period, therefore the unit labor cost, relative to our main trade partners (EU), decreased by 7.7 percentage points (Figure 3). This explains the positive dynamics of exports.   Public debt, as a percentage of GDP, is three times higher now than it was in 2008 (35% in 2017 compared to 12% in 2008), but this is a misleading figure for a number of reasons. First, in 2008 and few years before that, Romania did not access international markets, by its own choice, as it financed the deficit from one-off revenues. Second, international reserves were 10 billion euro higher by the end of 2017 compared to the end of 2007 (Figure 4).  International reserves include a foreign exchange buffer which has been built since 2011, reached an average of 4 months of financing in 2013 and fluctuated around this level since then. This buffer is the first line of defense against short-term external shocks which may affect emerging markets, and our opinion is that it is a very good instrument which needs to be preserved and consolidated.  
4  Third, the financing gap is now much lower than it was when the crisis emerged: after jumping in 2009 to 16.4% of GDP, it gradually decreased year after year, it went below the 10% benchmark in 2014, then to 7.5% in 2017 and it stagnated now in 2018. (Figure 5).  Fourth, the refinancing risk has been significantly diminished as it is negatively correlated with the average maturity. As of June 2018, the average maturity of Romania’s Eurobonds is 9.7 years (Figure 6), and the investors base is much more diversified than in 2011. Average maturity for local bonds doubled from 1.6 to 3.2 years, and the average maturity of our debt is 6.4 years, compared to 3.8 years in 2011. Moreover, the share of public debt with fixed interest rate is 90%, which reduces the interest rate risk on the stock of debt. Regaining and consolidating our access to the international markets after the crisis has been a major success of all governments and it is a sign of trust in our economy.   Another factor pointing towards lower contagion risk from external shocks refers to net external debt. The net external debt is now lower than in 2008: 20.2% of GDP in 2017, against 27% in 2008 (Figure 7).  The reduced contagion risk is also visible in the banking sector, through at least 5 key indicators. Foreign denominated loans represent now only one third of the total stock of loans, compared to two thirds prior to the crisis, therefore reducing the exposure of debtors to foreign exchange risk (Figure 8). Financing from the parent banks are now 9 billion euro (as of July 2018), compared to 26.1 billion euro in December 2008 (Figure 9). Currently (as of July 2018), domestic deposits count for 70.9% of total banks’ liabilities, whilst the foreign liabilities represent only 9% of total banks’ liabilities.  Loan to deposit ratio decreased from 122% in December 2008 to 75.2% in June 2018, showing that the local deposits are now the main source of financing for banks. Of course, the higher solvability ratio (Figure 10) and the much lower NPLs (Figure 11) also indicate that the banking sector is more resilient now than ever to external shocks.   
5  Even the high concentration of sovereign debt in the hands of local banks has a positive side effect, which is the relatively low reliance on non-residents (they account for about 18% of the market).  These are all indicators of reducing the contagion effect by alleviating the risk of a sudden reversal in the investors’ sentiment – which was described as a high systemic risk in the latest Financial Stability Report of the National Bank of Romania.   Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, referring to the assessment of risks in emerging economies (2017), said that three elements are important:  first, the vulnerabilities in the EMEs themselves;   second, the evolution of advanced-economies monetary policies;   third, how markets might respond to that evolution.   Emerging economies are takers in the global markets; we cannot do much about the last two elements mentioned above, which are exogenous.   Our duty is to prevent the accumulation of domestic vulnerabilities, because deterioration in a country’s economic conditions makes it more vulnerable to adverse external shocks.   The main medium-term vulnerabilities of the Romanian economy refer to the accumulation of the twin deficits when growth is above potential, to debt sustainability in an adverse scenario, but also to the insufficient progress on structural reforms – all being further constrained by the biggest loss of the last 10 years which is the loss of working force through emigration.   Public debt is now sustainable, but a word of caution is needed with respect to an adverse scenario in which the structural deficit does not return to the MTO. As our model shows (Figure 12 and 13), medium term debt sustainability is ensured only by returning to the medium term budgetary objective.   
6  The structural budget deficit has been deviating from the MTO (1% of GDP) since 2016. Nowadays structural deficit is, however, the cash deficit of tomorrow, which will need to be financed under circumstances that may turn unfavorable for emerging economies (Figure 14). The recent economic deceleration from 6.9% in 2017 to 4.2% y-o-y in first half 2018 is a double edged sword. On the one hand, it represents a slowdown compared to last year. On the other hand, it brings growth towards its potential, therefore reducing the output gap and making growth more sustainable. But, as former US President Harry Truman said, “All my economists say on the one hand…on the other hand…Give me a one-handed economist!”.  The current account deficit, although much lower than prior to the crisis and below its long time trend of 4% of GDP, remains a concern because our peers are recording current account surpluses in these years (Figure 15). However, it remains fully financed from autonomous flows (FDI and European funds) (Figure 16). Let me make two remarks here. The FDI flows, although lower than prior to the crisis, are much more stable, as they only comprise of equity and reinvested profits (especially after mid-2014), while short-term intra-company loans have practically vanished. As for the European funds, in the last 10 years, more than 40 billion euros entered the country, representing a factor of the increase in the monetary aggregates.  This brings me to the issue of inflation. Price stability is our main task and I think we did a good job, given the circumstances. Last year the inflation target was met.  This year, after a fast raise in inflation mostly due to administered prices and imported inflation, we saw that inflation stagnated in June and then went down in July, following our three interest rate hikes in the first four months of the year and subsequently more firm liquidity management. CORE 2 adjusted inflation, an indicator that excludes highly volatile prices, has been decreasing since May (Figure 17). We are confident that inflation will reach our target by the end of this year, even if that would be at its upper bound. Next year, we expect inflation to go down close to 3%, but, as always, our predictions are not interest rate policy-neutral.   
7  What is important to emphasize is that investors are discriminating among emerging economies, and for good reasons. Romania belongs to the group of Central Europe, with lower exchange rate volatility than its peers and slightly higher yields and interest rates than them, but very far away from the troubled emerging markets (Figure 18, 19, 20 and 21).   Nevertheless, there is no time for complacency. And there is no room left for demand-side measures in the absence of supply side policies aimed at increasing potential GDP, and at improving the utilization of factors.   Structural reforms are incomplete and a possible roadmap for euro-accession or just for further convergence cannot be done without a detailed program of these reforms which should cover governance issues (both in the public and private sectors), investment prioritization, better tax collection, broader reporting, centralized procurement, addressing the issue of companies with negative capital,  and much more.   In the financial sector, the recent Financial Sector Assessment Program undertaken by the IMF and WB has issued a number of recommendations for structural reforms, including a series of macroprudential policies which the National Bank has already started to implement.   Agustin Carstens, General Manager of the Bank for International Settlement, said at the presentation of the 2018 Annual Report in Basel: “We must seize the day. Addressing vulnerabilities is key to keeping the growth momentum on track. The stronger performance gives us a window to pursue necessary reforms and recalibrate policies. Let’s not miss this opportunity”.   On this note, let me conclude here and wish you all not to miss the opportunities.

Sabine Lautenschläger: European banking supervision - towards acommon cultureStatement by Ms Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the EuropeanCentral Bank and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the European Central Bank, at theEurofi Financial Forum 2018, Vienna, 6 September 2018.*   *   *Since 2014, we have made huge steps towards establishing a truly European system of bankingsupervision and embracing a common supervisory culture.Does this mean nothing more needs to be done? Not quite. For a fully-fledged common cultureyou need to have three things:First, you need a truly unified legal basis. You simply cannot build a comprehensive commonsupervisory culture if you have to apply a different set of rules in each of the 19 countries.Just think how we need to treat fit and proper assessments differently from one country tothe next.Second, you need harmonised administrative practices. And here, we have made goodprogress in the last four years – wherever the legislator granted us scope. We establishedpractices for all the major areas of supervision, such as the SREP, the treatment of NPLs,stress tests, the ICAAP, the ILAAP, and so on.Third, you need time and cooperation. After all, staff from 19 countries and 26 authoritieshave to be persuaded to leave their cultural comfort zone and align how they think, assessand act.I measure how far we have come by the frequency with which banks ask about changes insupervisory actions.In other words: how often do banks complain about changes in the way they are beingsupervised? They complain a great deal, I can tell you.And we keep pushing forward. Let me give you just a few examples:We strive to increase the number of cross-border on-site missions, with even more on-sitesupervisors working on banks outside their home country. The success of this initiative willlargely depend on the number of on-site supervisors the national authorities are willing tosend.We have established a rotation scheme for members of our Joint Supervisory Teams. Thistoo will help to spread a common culture. At the same time, it helps to avoid supervisorycapture.We foster exchange between supervisors from across the euro area. We bring themtogether in many different working groups to devise training manuals and supervisoryguidance.But the ECB cannot create a common supervisory culture by itself. The national authorities canand should contribute, too. I understand, of course, that it is difficult to let go of traditions thathave been honed over decades. Culture is a sticky thing.But national authorities should embrace the European idea. And they should seize theopportunity to contribute to a new, common supervisory culture. They should let more of theirstaff come to the ECB, for a while at least. Let them work in a European environment and carrythis culture back to their home countries. 1 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
And the idea of a European supervisory culture should be reflected in how we deal with banks.For example, national reporting requirements should be dropped; instead, we should aim for asingle European reporting framework.To sum up: a common supervisory culture is emerging, but it still needs to be nurtured andnudged.Thank you for your attention. 2 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
Nestor A Espenilla, Jr: Press statement for the 2017 FinancialStability Report Press BriefingPress statement by Mr Nestor A Espenilla, Jr, Governor of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP, thecentral bank of the Philippines), for the 2017 Financial Stability Report Press Briefing, Manila, 28August 2018.*   *   *Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon.Thank you for joining the Financial Stability Coordination Council (FSCC) as we mark animportant milestone. Today, the FSCC – composed of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP),the Department of Finance (DoF), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), theInsurance Commission (IC), the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation (PDIC),– is proud toissue the 2017 Financial Stability Report (FSR).The 2017 FSR embodies our firm and collective resolve not only to build-up and highlight thebenefits of sustained stability.  It also aims to address any emerging or incipient instability.The 2017 FSR is the FSCC’s first publication. While the BSP has in the past, crafted FSRs forits internal use, the 2017 FSR we issue today emphasizes the consultative and collaborativenature of the FSCC.  The report is tangible and clear output which leverages on the respectiveexpertise and insights of FSCC member-agencies.The 2017 FSR will be publicly accessible on each of our individual websites. This accessibilitysupports our unwavering intention to communicate, raise awareness and to help businessmen,financial market players, scholars, as well as the general public to make informed choices aboutour respective futures.  The report is not just a compilation of technical expressions.  Rather, it isnarrative, and is a compelling one.Thus far, the Philippines has enjoyed 78 quarters of uninterrupted growth. The FSCC iscommitted to sustaining and encouraging — with policies, initiatives and regulatory frameworks— the Filipino’s innate innovative spirit.  Greater use of financial technology is targeted along withthe adoption of measures to tap the transformational benefits of credit in the context of evolvingand dynamic market conditions and their attendant risks.One of these challenges and risks is that of changing market prices and their impact on theservicing of debt. This issue is a primary focus of this 2017 FSR. As interest rates rise globallyand as emerging market currencies depreciate, outstanding debt obligations will have to berepaid, re-priced, and refinanced at higher rates. While financial market interventions arehighlighted in this report, the continuing value of sustaining our economic momentum is alsoemphasized.In the 2017 FSR, there are discussions on the ASEAN integration and on the advent of financialtechnology applications. The FSCC sees a strong upside in these initiatives. Discussion of thesetopics contextualizes our shared goal to accrue benefits derived from them while at the sametime, remaining vigilant and prepared to intervene should systemic risks develop.Finally, the FSR also explores data gaps and other areas of policy interest. Better data isessential as empirical basis for our actions is required. However, data gathering and analysis arerecurring challenges in the field of financial stability.  Thus, a strong emphasis is placed on thiswork to support and address other policy issues along the way.Our Technical Team put considerable effort in completing the 2017 FSR.  We expect that futureissues will be released in the first trimester of every year. We also expect more engagement 1 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
from the public, market players and the media, not just to highlight future content but to raiseappreciation for financial stability issues through a concerted communication plan.We have much to look forward to.Thank you again for joining us today and good afternoon. 2 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
Yves Mersch: Financial stability and the European Central BankSpeech by Mr Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, atthe ESCB Legal Conference, Frankfurt am Main, 6 September 2018.*   *   *IntroductionThe growing importance of “financial stability” in the post-crisis public debateThe recent crisis put financial stability at the centre of public discussions on how to improveeconomic resilience. What should the institutional architecture of financial stability look like andwhat should be the role of central banks in this context? While such questions have largely beensettled regarding price stability, no similar consensus exists when it comes to financial stability.There is neither a settled institutional template for financial stability nor a consensus about therole of central banks. The economic literature has suggested various models, some of whichhave been tested around the world. In my speech today, however, I will not go into theeconomics of financial stability. I will instead approach the issue from a legal perspective. Thequestion I will address is: what role does EU law ascribe to the ECB in contributing to the stabilityof the financial system?The general constitutional frameworkWhen we talk about the role of the ECB from a legal perspective, we are essentially referring toits tasks, mandates and competences. In the compound EU legal order, these are covered by aset of basic principles. First and foremost, the EU is a union based on the rule of law.Thismeans that every action taken by EU institutions needs to be founded on Union law and ultimatelyon the Treaties. This fundamental constitutional value has two manifestations.First, the principle of conferral requires that the EU should act only within the limits of thecompetences conferred upon it by the Member States in the Treaties to attain the objectives setout therein. Moreover, in exercising its competences, the EU must respect the principles ofsubsidiarity and proportionality. Second, the principle of institutional balance provides that all EUinstitutions must act in accordance with the powers conferred on them by the Treaties andrespect the competences of other EU institutions. These two principles should guide thediscussion on the role of the ECB in financial stability. They also highlight the fact that getting theanswer right is ultimately a rule-of-law issue.As I will argue today, the authors of the Treaties did not make financial stability an ECB objective.The ECB’s only primary responsibility is price stability. The Treaty-makers did not provide eitherfor specific financial stability-oriented instruments or for a dedicated financial stability institutionalset-up at the Union level, if I abstract from the coordination role of the European Systemic RiskBoard (ESRB). And without an objective and dedicated instruments, the Treaties could not haveconferred on the ECB a stand-alone task. In financial stability, thus, the ECB has only a limited,contributory role according to the Treaties.Financial stability in ECB lawFinancial stability: a protean conceptThe Treaties do not contain a definition of financial stability. Like price stability, financial stability isan objective of public policy. Unlike price stability, however, financial stability remains a proteanconcept, with various manifestations and different understandings of its basic aspects.1234 1 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
First, the notion of financial stability is nebulous and much more difficult to capture than pricestability. The term financial stability is sometimes used in a very broad way to cover objectivesand institutions that encompass the stability of the economy as a whole and also include thefinancial stability of governments, as in the Treaty establishing the European Stability Mechanismor in the title of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF). In my speech today, I will use theterm financial stability in a narrow sense to refer to the “stability of the financial system”, which isthe wording used in Article 127(5) of the TFEU.But even within this narrow meaning, there is no single or even widely accepted definition offinancial stability. Some authors and institutions have tried to arrive at a positive definition offinancial stability by describing its essential features, while others start from its absence –financial instability. The ECB approaches financial stability in terms of systemic risk: financialstability is a state whereby the build-up of systemic risk is prevented.In turn, systemic risk is“the risk that the provision of necessary financial products and services by the financial systemwill be impaired to a point where economic growth and welfare may be materially affected”.Simply put, financial stability means that the ﬁnancial system is expected to withstandunforeseeable events or shocks without major disruption and to continue providing its services tothe economy. Compare this definition with the much more concrete ECB definition of pricestability, which is a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices for theeuro area of below 2%. In the pursuit of price stability, the ECB aims to maintain inflation ratesbelow, but close to, 2% over the medium term. These two definitions clearly illustrate that, whenit comes to financial stability, we are operating at a much more abstract level, with considerablyvaguer metrics.Financial stability and monetary policy also differ in terms of the instruments they use to pursuetheir objectives. Monetary policy has a fairly settled set of tools – first and foremost, at least inconventional times, the short-term interest rate. Financial stability, however, has neither aprimary instrument nor a standard taxonomy of instruments. Instead, there are various differentinstruments, ranging from those from the toolbox of the supervisory regulations (Article 5 of theSSMR), such as maximum loan-to-value limits and countercyclical capital buffers, to taxation, aswell as interest rates. Could this become an example of policymaking with other people’sinstruments?Some of these instruments are used at national level, while others are deployed in a certainsector or with regard to an individual financial institution. Many of these instruments which havefinancial stability as their stated aim advance macroprudential policies. And so macroprudentialpolicies, like financial stability, are often a concept onto which “anyone could project their ownsense of priorities” – priorities that often compete with each other.Third, unlike price stability, financial stability does not fall under the exclusive competence of asingle institution. Instead, various actors at national, supranational and international level aregiven different roles and responsibilities in pursuing financial stability. Finance ministries,supervisors, expert bodies (the ESRB, national macroprudential committees and/or regulatorswhich diverge widely in terms of their powers and composition), central banks and the Basel-based Financial Stability Board have all been ascribed a role in financial stability.Thus, in all these respects, financial stability is still not a settled field of public policy in the sameway that price stability is. And this is not just a matter of theoretical interest. It also has a bearingon the question of who should ultimately be responsible in this field: experts or political bodies. Iwill come back to this point at the end of my speech.What is the role of the ECB in the field of financial stability?Let me now come to my basic question. What role does EU law, and especially primary EU law,foresee for the ECB in the field of financial stability?56789 2 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
The basic Treaty provision to start from is Article 127 of the TFEU under the chapter on monetarypolicy, which contains the objectives and tasks of the ECB/ESCB. This Article does not explicitlypoint to any clear, unambiguous role for the ECB regarding financial stability. Financial stability isnot among the objectives of the ECB enshrined in the first paragraph of Article 127. The primaryobjective is defined there as being the maintenance of price stability. And, without prejudice tothis objective, the ECB has a mandate to support the general economic policies in the Union witha view to contributing to the general objectives of the Union. Nor is financial stability one of thefour basic tasks referred to in the second paragraph of Article 127. First in the list is, of course,the basic task of defining and implementing the monetary policy of the Union. This basic task isaccompanied by certain monetary tools, specifically provided for in primary law. As I alreadymentioned, no such tools are provided for in the area of financial stability.The ECB’s contributory role in financial stabilityThe only explicit reference to financial stability in Article 127 is in the fifth paragraph. Thisparagraph sets out the ESCB’s duty to “contribute” to the smooth conduct of policies pursued by“competent authorities” relating to the stability of the financial system. Thus, the ESCB is given acontributory role in the field of financial stability. That contribution can be exercised through itsmonetary policy task or its supervisory task, both of which embed financial stability as acontribution to competent authorities.What is the scope of the ECB’s contributory role?The concept of a “contribution” appears not just in Article 127 of the TFEU. It is also used by theTreaties to describe the allocation of powers and to demarcate competences between theMember States and the EU in a variety of fields. For example, Article 170(1) of the TFEU providesthat “the Union shall contribute to the establishment and development of trans-Europeannetworks in the areas of transport, telecommunications and energy infrastructures”. The sameformulation is used in Article 169(1) of the TFEU regarding consumer protection. In these fields,the EU has a shared competence with the Member States. There is, however, a significantdifference between these Articles and Article 127(5). In the case of such shared competences,the EU is given the power to contribute directly to the achievement of the objectives. When itcomes to financial stability, however, the ECB is tasked with contributing to the smooth conductof policies pursued by the competent authorities. There is a critical difference here. If the ECBwere tasked with contributing to the attainment of financial stability, it would – like the EU in thefield of networks – have leeway to identify policies that better serve the achievement of this aim.However, the ECB’s role in contributing to financial stability would instead seem to be equivalentto the category of Union competences with the narrowest possible scope, namely supplementaryor supporting competences. In these fields, the EU can only support actions of the MemberStates “without thereby superseding their competence in these areas”.Thus it is clear that the ECB has neither exclusive powers in the field of financial stability norcompetence to act on its own. “Contribution” does not establish a competence for independentand stand-alone action. To contribute to the attainment of an aim is to support it; the basicidentification of how the aim of financial stability is to be achieved thus lies with other “competent”institutions. And so does the primary responsibility.Exactly how the ECB should carry out this contributory role is not specified in either the Treaty orthe Statute of the ESCB – unlike monetary policy, for which the ECB’s functions and operationsare set out in detail. The ECB can use its usual tools, to the extent that they are suitable, tocontribute to financial stability. The ECB’s advisory functions are of great relevance in thiscontext. Article 127(4) of the TFEU calls for consultation on the basic tasks listed in thepreceding paragraph. Only then does paragraph (5) mention financial stability, but the Councildecision implementing this part of the Treaty also included the obligation to consult on nationalacts that influence the stability of financial institutions and markets. Regarding Union legislation,1011121314 3 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
in the chapter on prudential supervision, Article 25 of the Statute of the ESCB states that theECB “may offer advice to and be consulted by the Council and the Commission on the scopeand implementation of Union legislation” relating to the stability of financial system. According toArticle 141(2) of the TFEU, for Member States with a derogation the ECB “shall … holdconsultations concerning issues falling within the competence of the national central banks andaffecting the stability of financial institutions and markets”.In any case, the contributory role of the ECB needs to support its monetary policy tasks or thetasks conferred upon it relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions and otherfinancial institutions.Monetary policy and financial stabilityAs Article 25 of the Statute of the ESCB refers to prudential supervision, Article 127(5) is the onlyreference to the ECB/ESCB. It is also interesting to note that the advisory functions arementioned in the Treaty after the basic tasks and before financial stability, while in the Statutethey follow Article 3.3.This leads to the following considerations:First, it should be noted that the ECB, when pursuing the objective of maintaining price stability,follows a two-pillar strategy that takes account of monetary and economic analysis, and includesfinancial stability considerations. The ECB’s two-pillar strategy forms the basis for the GoverningCouncil's overall assessment of the risks to price stability and its monetary policy decisions.Moreover, the ECB may use its ancillary policy tools to address financial stability to the extentthat this is necessary to carry out its basic tasks. Under such circumstances, financial stabilityis not the ultimate aim of ECB policy but a means to fulfil its basic tasks. In principle, this appliesto all the basic tasks of the ECB listed in Article 127(2) of the TFEU, but it is most important formonetary policy. Financial stability, namely the proper functioning of the financial system, isnecessary for the transmission of monetary policy. In Gauweiler, the Court accepted thatmeasures intended to preserve the monetary transmission mechanism may be regarded aspertaining to the objective of maintaining price stability, thus falling within the mandate of theECB. Addressing issues of financial stability in order to promote price stability is thereforepossible with two caveats:First, price stability enjoys primacy. Within the current legal framework, and by contrast withother jurisdictions, price stability is the ECB’s only primary objective. If there is a conflict betweenprice stability, which is primarily concerned with the business cycle, and financial stability, whichis more concerned with the financial cycle, and some trade-off between the two is required, theTreaties require primacy to be given to price stability. Financial stability cannot take precedenceover price stability.Second, financial stability-related policies need to comply with the principle of proportionality.According to Article 5(4) of the TEU, Union institutions shall observe the principle ofproportionality when exercising the competences conferred on them. The principle ofproportionality was also used by the Court of Justice to assess the legality of the ECB’s OutrightMonetary Transactions (OMT) programme as a means to achieve price stability. According to theprinciple of proportionality, the content and form of Union action shall not exceed what isnecessary to achieve the objectives of the Treaties. This means that ECB policies regardingfinancial stability that serve monetary policy need to be appropriate for maintaining price stabilityand should not go beyond what is necessary to achieve this objective.In principle, therefore, financial stability-oriented instruments can be used if necessary to carryout the basic tasks, but subject to serving the primary objective of price stability and within1516171819 4 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
proportionality limitations.Financial stability and the prudential supervision of credit institutionsThe other aspect of ECB involvement in financial stability is through the ECB’s prudentialsupervisory role. Article 127(6) of the TFEU (also reflected in Article 25 of the Statute of theESCB) permits the Council to confer specific tasks upon the ECB concerning the prudentialsupervision of credit institutions and other financial institutions with the exception of insuranceundertakings. This provision was activated through the establishment of the Single SupervisoryMechanism (SSM) under the SSM Regulation. As made explicit in the SSM Regulation, the Unionlegislator conferred prudential supervisory tasks on the ECB with a view to contributing tofinancial stability within the Union and each Member State.Article 5 of the SSM Regulation also makes provision for certain macroprudential tasks and tools.These competences to require capital buffers to be held by credit institutions in addition to ownfunds requirements, including countercyclical buffer rates and other measures aimed ataddressing systemic or macroprudential risks, are conferred on national authorities. This reflectsthe fact that primary responsibility for macroprudential policies lies with national authorities. Ifdeemed necessary, the ECB, instead of national authorities, may apply higher requirements forcapital buffers than those applied by the national authorities and more stringent measures aimedat addressing systemic or macroprudential risks. The procedure for adopting these top-up ECBmeasures may be triggered only at the initiative of the national authorities, emphasising thenational character of macroprudential competences.The microprudential and macroprudential tools contained in the SSM Regulation are thus specificaspects of the financial stability mandate of the ECB, which is based on the specificauthorisation in Article 127(6) of the TFEU. Neither the SSM Regulation in general, however, norArticle 5 in particular confers a general competence on the ECB in the fields of financial stabilityand macroprudential policy.Democracy, independence and financial stabilityWhen we interpret the competences of public institutions we are essentially discussing the limitsof their powers. As with any discussion on public powers, the aspect of legitimacy also needs tobe considered. In the field of financial stability and macroprudential policies, a multitude ofinstitutions are involved, such as parliaments, EU political institutions, national governments, andexpert bodies at both the European and the national level. Some of these actors derive theirlegitimacy from their independent expertise, others from their democratic accountability. Whatrole each of them should play in achieving financial stability is intimately connected with thesource of their legitimacy.This brings me back to the first point of my speech: financial stability might be an objective lesswell suited to independent expertise-based bodies than a price stability objective. Even thoughthe Treaty does not give a definition of price stability, it is an objective that is quantifiable. TheECB Governing Council aims to maintain inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the mediumterm. Putting a figure on price stability makes monetary policy more transparent and provides aclear and measurable yardstick against which European citizens can hold the ECB accountable.For financial stability no such clear yardstick exists. Without clear objectives, however, it is muchmore difficult to measure the performance of independent, expertise-based institutions and holdthem to account. Beyond that, the pursuit of financial stability often involves choices withstronger distributional implications. This is an additional argument in favour of the ultimateresponsibility remaining in the political sphere. Financial stability is thus a policy area whereexpert bodies and politically accountable institutions are called on to cooperate, with no onehaving exclusive responsibility. In this field, expert bodies with strong guarantees ofindependence, such as the ECB, might be better suited to “contributing” in an advisory capacity2021 5 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
while the “ultimate responsibility” is rather borne by institutions embedded in politicalaccountability arrangements at the national level. Otherwise political pressures to adopt one orthe other stance in questions of financial stability might also threaten central bank independence.ConclusionsAt the time the Treaties were drafted, financial stability and the potential differences betweenfinancial and business cycles were not a primary consideration. The Treaty provisions do notpoint towards a clear, unambiguous role for the ECB. Certain economic approaches may nowsuggest different ways of coping with financial stability challenges that, on some occasions,would involve a wider role for central banks. But the ECB, as an institution bound by the rule oflaw, has to operate within the limits set by the Treaties.Article 127(5) of the Treaty implies that the ECB has only a contributory and supporting role withregard to financial stability. This role is partly discharged through its advisory role in thepreparation of EU or national acts.Beyond that, the ECB’s financial stability role is embedded within the ECB’s basic monetarypolicy task and the ECB’s microprudential supervisory tasks. The specific macroprudential taskscontained in the SSM Regulation are supplementary in nature, and do not confer any generalcompetence on the ECB in the field of macroprudential policy.These are primarily legal conclusions that also reflect the relative positions of public institutions interms of independence and accountability. Beyond these considerations, however, there arepolitical and economic considerations that have not been addressed here.See Central bank governance and financial stability: A report by a Study Group chaired by Stefan Ingves, Bankfor International Settlements, 2011.Article 2 of theTEU.Article 5(2) of the TEU.Article 5(3) and (4) of the TEU.Garry J.

Benoît Cœuré: Interview in KathimeriniInterview with Mr Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank,in Kathimerini, conducted by Ms Eirini Chrysolora and published on 5 September 2018.*   *   *Does the completion of the programme mark a new era for Greece in your view? Isenhanced surveillance not just a continuation of the programme?Let me start by saying that it would be all too easy to take the opportunity of Greece graduatingfrom the programme to turn the page and say “mission accomplished”. The programme yearshave been very difficult for the Greek people. Policymakers across Europe have a duty to learnthe lessons of this painful journey and improve policy, at both European and national levels.With hindsight, one can argue that the design of the programmes could have been more effectivein supporting social safety nets and combating rent-seeking, that the pace of reform of thefinancial sector could have been faster, and that the need for debt reduction was overlooked bycreditors. All this has gradually improved over time. I would like to congratulate the Greekgovernment for its remarkable work in recent years, implementing key reforms in the economyand the society in general and in the financial sector in particular. For example, social solidarityincome helps direct scarce resources to those who need them most, and opening up industriesor sectors, such as pharmacies, benefits households which have borne the brunt of crisisadjustment. Regarding the financial sector more specifically, the new legislative frameworkprovides much better support for reducing non-performing loans (NPLs) compared with thesituation a couple of years ago. This will help banks support economic growth and job creationmore effectively.But let’s not forget where it all started. Never again should a euro area country end up in such anunsustainable position as Greece’s in 2010. We need responsible national fiscal and economicpolicies, and a better euro area governance framework.As for enhanced surveillance, it is not a new programme but rather a strengthened form ofcooperation between Greece, the European institutions and the euro area countries to supportthe transition towards full market access. Make no mistake, the burden of gaining the trust ofmarkets and depositors has now fully shifted to the Greek government. Don’t expect buildingtrust among investors to be easier than convincing the institutions.What will be the ECB’s role in the context of enhanced surveillance? Will you provideyour contribution as in the past?We will remain involved in the enhanced surveillance, as mandated by the European regulationsunderlying this framework (the so-called two-pack). But the end of the programme is also anopportunity for us to refocus our activities, as already indicated in the opinion we published inApril 2018. Looking ahead, our work in Greece will now be focused on financial and macro-criticalissues. More specifically, this includes financial sector stability, macroeconomic projections,headline fiscal targets, and sustainability and financial needs.What do you see as the main priorities for the post-programme period? What are theareas that Greece should focus on in the years ahead so as to achieve sustainablegrowth? And what are the main risks?In line with what I have just said, allow me to focus on the financial sector. Reducing NPLs iscertainly top of the list from our point of view. On the one hand, only stronger and healthier bankscan provide the necessary basis for an increase in the supply of credit that can supporteconomic growth. On the other hand, the restructuring of private and tax debt that could 1 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
accompany the reduction of NPLs is also expected to help healthy companies restart theiractivities and thus reinforce the demand for credit. A lot has been achieved under theprogramme. The legislative framework is in place, but continued implementation will be key.Improving the effectiveness of the judicial system is also essential to guarantee a well-functioningfinancial sector. We also still envisage improvements in banks’ governance frameworks, whichwill be essential to establish the conditions necessary to attract both domestic and foreigninvestors and allow the divestment of Hellenic Financial Stability Fund (HFSF) holdings over time.In any case, it will be very important that the authorities refrain from trying to influence banks’credit decisions and focus instead on improving the framework within which they operate.Are Greek banks now safe in terms of their capital position? Will they manage to reachthe NPL targets as agreed? Should the targets be tightened for the years after 2019?The capital position of Greek banks has strengthened substantially during the programme and isnow quantitatively at higher levels than in other countries affected by the crisis. However, thequality of Greek banks’ capital is lower than elsewhere in Europe, consisting partly of deferred taxassets, and there is still a large amount of non-performing exposures (NPE) as a legacy of thecrisis. There is a need to be prudent and to set ambitious targets in order to significantly reducethe NPE ratio by the end of 2019. The performance of Greek banks has so far been broadly inline with their approved NPL targets, as shown in the Bank of Greece’s quarterly NPL monitoringreports. However, the targets to be achieved by the end of 2019 are back-loaded. Beyond 2019,continued efforts are needed to further reduce the NPE ratio in Greece in the years ahead, until itis closer to the euro area average.Swift progress in resolving NPLs is crucial not only for economic recovery, but also for theforward-looking capital adequacy of Greek banks. This depends on the economic environmentstabilising and, importantly, on the continued and improved effectiveness of the relevant legalframeworks (household and corporate insolvency, out-of-court workout, NPL sales and e-auctions). For example, it will be easier to reduce the amount of NPLs if there is a reduction inthe backlog of cases related to the household insolvency framework (the so-called Katseli law)that are still pending before the courts. In June the government presented an ambitious actionplan that will be closely monitored in the context of the enhanced surveillance framework.Are you satisfied with the pace of e-auctions?A comprehensive approach involving all stakeholders must remain in place at all times to ensurethat the e-auction system continues to be successful. We have seen a clear improvement herein recent months, but further progress in raising the number of auctions is needed, especially forproperties located outside Attica. So we will continue to monitor the situation closely, incooperation with the authorities. It is also important to recognise that e-auctions have incentivisedborrowers (including strategic defaulters) and banks to work towards a mutually beneficialsolution. There are indications of increased restructurings and settlements of loans now that e-auctions have started.The ECB lifted the waiver for Greek government bonds. Wasn’t the enhancedsurveillance sufficient to keep it? How much liquidity did banks have to get from ELA asa result of lifting the waiver?The minimum credit rating rule for ECB collateral eligibility pre-dates the Greek crisis. In 2010,we acknowledged that the rule could be procyclical and granted a waiver to countries under anEU/IMF programme, because policy conditionality and access to comprehensive informationgave us confidence about the sovereign’s creditworthiness. The framework has been appliedunchanged to all countries since 2010. But enhanced surveillance is not a programme and doesnot entail conditionality – I assume this is exactly why the government accepted it! It thereforedoes not comply with our framework. 2 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
That being said, the lifting of the waiver was a “non-event” for banks, as one Greek bank CEOrecently pointed out. Greek banks have broadened their market financing and successfullyshifted parts of their financing from monetary policy operations onto the interbank repo market.The significant increase in deposits during the summer months helped as well. Overall, bankliquidity has been continuously improving. It is important that this trend is further supported in theperiod ahead.Is the Greek debt sustainable according to the ECB? We were wondering, if youconsider it sustainable, why you couldn’t have included the Greek bonds in the publicsector purchase programme (PSPP – also known as QE) for at least a few weeks afterthe Eurogroup decision on debt measures, when the waiver was still in force. Are yougoing to publish the ECB’s debt sustainability analysis?The agreement reached by the Eurogroup on 22 June was a significant step towards restoringdebt sustainability, especially over the medium term (that is, until the end of the deferral period).In the long term, we welcome the Eurogroup’s readiness to consider further debt measures ifthere are adverse developments. Indeed, downside risks to both macroeconomic and fiscalassumptions remain sizeable.As for the PSPP, Greek government bonds lost their eligibility on 21 August when the programmeended. At that point, the Eurogroup’s debt measures had still not been ratified. In any case,purchases would have been very limited over such a short period.Is there any chance that Greek bonds could be included at some point in the future inthe reinvestment phase of the PSPP? How many years do you think the reinvestment ofmaturing securities will last?Without a programme, Greek government bonds are now treated like any other bonds for thepurpose of ECB eligibility. Once they regain investment grade status they could be included in allECB programmes, subject to a Governing Council decision.As you know, we intend to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchasedunder the asset purchase programme (APP) for an extended period of time after the end of ournet asset purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidityconditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.The government seems to have put on hold, for the time being, plans to return to themarkets. Do you think that Greece has now regained full access to international capitalmarkets? Do you think it should wait until after the elections to go back to the markets?Greece’s market access conditions have clearly improved compared with one year ago. Bondmarket liquidity has also improved after the swap operation conducted in November 2017, whichcontributed to the normalisation of the Greek government bond yield curve and also supportedincreased foreign participation in the bond market. Over the past few months, however, Greekbond yields have remained elevated and volatile, reacting to international and European stress,even after the approval of debt measures by the Eurogroup in June and the upgrade of Greece’scredit rating by the rating agencies. So we should be patient and prudent when assessing marketaccess. Crucially, investor confidence will rely on the continued implementation of reforms andon avoiding backtracking on past improvements.Are you concerned that a crisis, for example in Italy, could jeopardise Greece’s marketaccess? Wouldn’t a precautionary credit line, as Mr Stournaras had suggested, havebeen useful in this respect?Indeed, a precautionary credit line would have helped to cushion negative spillover effects from 3 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
the international markets and to reinforce the credibility of the Greek sovereign as an issuer. Itwas therefore a less risky path from a purely financial standpoint. That being said, it would haveentailed continued policy conditionality. I respect the government’s judgement that, after eightyears under various programmes, it was time for Greece to regain ownership of its policies.Is the ECB concerned about a hostile spirit often expressed by the government towardthe Governor of the Bank of Greece, Mr Stournaras, and recently even indirectlytowards the former Vice-President of the ECB, Mr Papademos?We do not intervene in internal political discussions, whether in Greece or elsewhere. It isimportant that the independence of the Bank of Greece and its governor is preserved. Personally,I have the highest appreciation for Mr Papademos and Mr Stournaras as economists andpolicymakers. I must stress that an independent statistical system is also crucial. I won’tcomment on Greek judicial decisions, but one should not underestimate the damage inflicted onGreece’s credibility by never-ending legal action against the former president of Elstat. MrGeorgiou discharged his duty in compliance with the European framework and his findingsremain unchallenged today, including by the government.Do you think that the planned pension cuts for 2019 should be suspended or postponed,as the government wants? Has the government made any concrete proposals ahead ofthe mission and in view of the 2019 draft budget? The government also plans tax cuts in2019 using the expected excess primary surplus, affecting ENFIA and social securitycontributions, among others. Do you agree with these measures?In line with what I said on the refocusing of our contribution to the programme, we do not want todiscuss specific fiscal policy measures. What is essential for us is that fiscal targets for 2019are met and that the budget composition is growth-friendly. As is the case in a number ofcountries in the euro area, it is important that the level of direct income taxation supportseconomic growth while ensuring that fiscal targets are met.What about a reversal of labour market reforms (minimum wage, collective bargaining)?Do the institutions have to consent? And do you think the markets will react, interpretingit as a sign of backtracking?Again, I don’t want to discuss specific measures.When do you think capital controls should be fully removed?The pace and composition of capital controls are in the hands of the Greek authorities. Many ofthe restrictions imposed in mid-2015 have already been lifted; the government published aroadmap for relaxing capital controls in May 2017, which it is closely following. This steady andresponsible approach has been successful so far. Only once capital controls have beencompletely removed will the Greek economy and Greek banks be able to function normally insidethe euro area. To achieve this, it is crucial to build an environment which strengthens depositors’confidence and makes the Greek financial system resilient to outside stress. 4 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
Nestor A Espenilla, Jr: Ensuring price stability through monetarypolicyPresentation by Mr Nestor A Espenilla, Jr, Governor of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP, thecentral bank of the Philippines), during the Forum of the Economic Journalists’ Association of thePhilippines (EJAP), Manila, 28 August 2018.*   *   *Secretary of Finance Carlos Dominguez III, DBM Secretary Benjamin Diokno, NEDA Director-General Ernesto Pernia, DOTr Secretary Arthur Tugade, DPWH Secretary Mark Villar, esteemed guests, ladies and gentlemen, a pleasant morning to all of you. I would like to thankEJAP President Louella Desiderio, the Economic Journalists’ Association of the Philippines forinviting me to share the Bangko Sentral’s views on inflation, as well as our game plan to addressit.In the first part, I will dissect the numbers to identify the real drivers of the recent spike in inflation.I will then explain the BSP’s inflation outlook, or how we expect the inflation environment to evolveover the next two years. Casting inflation against this proper context helps put into sharper focusthe policy measures needed to address the issue.  I maintain that not only have the BSP’smonetary responses been timely and appropriate, but that tempering inflation and its side-effectswill require the coordinated efforts of various government agencies as well.Let me begin with the recent inflation numbers. In the first seven months of 2018, year-on-yearheadline inflation averaged 4.5 percent, well above the government’s target range of 2 – 4percent for the year. As this chart shows, supply-side factors are the main drivers of overallinflation. These include rising international oil prices, higher excise taxes, and weatherdisturbances that affected food supply.Meanwhile, in this next chart, we see how supply-side forces drive inflation on a month-on-monthbasis, with factors such as the recent increase in jeepney fares and utility rates contributing tothe July inflation print.There are two important points that I need to highlight in this chart. The first is that the inflationmomentum is slowing down, as headline inflation has generally declined in month-on-monthterms from 0.9 percent in January 2018 to 0.5 percent in July 2018. In particular, after spiking inthe first quarter of 2018, the month-on-month changes for electricity, tobacco, and sweetenedbeverages are seen to be slowly tapering off as we head deeper into the third quarter of the year.This supports our analysis that the impact of the excise tax adjustments is transitory.The second point is that supply-side factors have tremendous implications for monetary policy. Inparticular, central bankers generally consider these supply-side forces as beyond the directinfluence of monetary policy, which limits the effectiveness of monetary interventions. This is whycentral banks typically look through commodity price increases in a transitory supply shockepisode. Instead, central banks undertake action when there are incipient signs of second-roundeffects, like when price pressures spill over to the demand side, as we shall also see later.Now, what do all these imply for inflation and monetary policy in the next few months?Our baseline forecasts as of the recent Monetary Board meeting in August have generally shiftedhigher relative to the forecasts during the policy meeting in June. Inflation is expected to remainelevated in 2018 with the peak occurring sometime in the third quarter. Nonetheless, we expectinflation to revert to the inflation target range of 2 – 4 percent in 2019, as the effect of thetransitory supply shocks dissipate.We have seen similar pattern in the past. For example, in 2008, international oil prices and food 1 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
prices rose sharply, resulting in a year-on-year average inflation rate of 8.3 percent during theyear, before easing sharply to 4.2 percent in 2009.What did the BSP do to ensure price stability during this period? As the rise in prices wasprimarily supply-driven in origin, the BSP kept its policy rate steady and accommodated the first-round effects.However, supply-side pressures persisted and gave rise to second-round effects in terms ofwage and price-setting behavior. The BSP subsequently delivered timely and decisive action byraising the key policy rates by a total of 100 basis points between May and August 2018 whilealso strengthening its anti-inflation commentary.            Similar to what happened in 2008, we see from our assessment that upside riskscontinue to dominate the inflation outlook, as the sustained increase in core inflation points to apossible broadening of price pressures. Key upside risks include additional wage adjustments;pending petitions for adjustments in transport fares and electricity rates; faster-than-expectedmonetary policy normalization in advanced economies; and the proposed increase in the NFA’sbuying price of rice from farmers.Conversely, the main downside risks to inflation are the following: slower global economic growthdue to protectionist policies in advanced economies; geopolitical tensions in the Middle East,along with potentially lower rice prices resulting from the proposed replacement of quantitativerestrictions with tariffs and the deregulation of rice imports.At the same time, the BSP recognizes the potential price pressures of excessive volatility in theforeign exchange market and remains vigilant on the impact of sustained peso depreciation oninflation expectations.In sum, the BSP held the policy rate steady in the first quarter of 2018 amid the supply-driveninflation outturn. However, information beginning in the second quarter suggests incipient signs ofsecond-round effects, given the potential broadening of price pressures, the continueddominance of upside risks to the inflation outlook, and the elevated inflation expectations over thepolicy horizon. These considerations prompted the BSP to raise the policy rate by 25 basispoints (bps) in May 2018. To enhance our anti-inflation signal and help bring inflation toward atarget-consistent path over the medium term, we followed this up with another 25-bps hike inJune, and a stronger 50-bps hike earlier this month.  These monetary responses were necessary to help rein in the public’s inflation expectations andprevent sustained supply-side pressures from giving rise to further second-round effects, evenas we continue to expect average inflation to ease to within the inflation target of 2–4 percent in2019.  Further, the hikes are meant to ease excessive market pressure on the peso and addressthe potential impact of excessive peso volatility on inflation.Looking ahead, the BSP’s decisions on monetary policy will continue to be data-dependent andguided by our inflation forecasts. Sustained domestic growth also suggests that the economy can accommodate monetary policytightening. This growth is broad-based, thereby providing more opportunities across all segmentsof society.In the meantime, our external position is strong. Gross international reserves of US$76.9 billionas of July 2018 remain more than adequate, covering 7.4 months of imports of goods andpayments of services and income. Our external debt metrics are also favorable as external debt to GDP ratio continues to decline.On the current account, the moderate deficit is driven by robust growth of the Philippine economy 2 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
which requires higher imports of capital goods. Our imports are mostly capital goods, rawmaterials, and intermediate products, which are necessary for the economy’s sustainedexpansion.The peso continues to be flexible and market-determined, which allow us to conduct independentmonetary policy focused on domestic conditions. The peso has likewise maintained its externalprice competitiveness against baskets of currencies of all trading partners and trading partners inadvanced and developing economies. Nevertheless, we are cognizant that the peso can also besubject to excessive volatility especially in light of global interest rate and exchange ratedevelopments. We have to take these into account.At the same time, the BSP recognizes that because monetary responses do not fully addressthe root causes of inflation, addressing inflation will require mitigating measures from othergovernment agencies in order to temper the impact of supply-side forces on prices and socialwelfare.  Before I end my presentation, let me stress out that while the recent inflation outturns areunderpinned by factors outside the direct influence of monetary policy such as the higher excisetax, the rise in international oil prices, and adverse weather conditions, the BSP reiterates itsstrong commitment and readiness to take all necessary policy actions to safeguard thegovernment’s inflation targets and deliver on our primary mandate of price stability.Thank you and good day! 3 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
Philip Lowe: Remarks at Reserve Bank Board DinnerRemarks by Mr Philip Lowe, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, at the Reserve BankBoard Dinner, Perth, 4 September 2018.*   *   *Good evening.On behalf of the Reserve Bank Board I would like to warmly welcome you to this communitydinner. It is very good to be in Perth again. The Board met this morning at our office on StGeorges Terrace. This dinner is an opportunity for us to hear directly from you about how thingsare going in Western Australia. So thank you for joining us.As you have probably already heard, the Board left the cash rate unchanged at 1.5 per cent at itsmeeting this morning. I doubt that this decision surprised anybody. The cash rate has been at1.5 per cent for more than two years now and the Board expects it to remain there for a while yet.Lest you think that keeping interest rates unchanged for an extended period means that life at theReserve Bank of Australia must be very quiet, we are always closely tracking domestic andinternational developments and we have other important responsibilities that don't attract thesame spotlight as our monthly interest rate decisions.The RBA is responsible for the issuing of Australia's banknotes. We are currently undertaking amajor upgrade of our notes to protect against counterfeiters. All up, there are 1.6 billion individualbanknotes on issue – that's an average of around 65 notes for each of the 25 million people inAustralia. Despite the growth of tap-and-go and other forms of electronic payments, the value ofnotes on issue as a share of GDP is the highest in more than five decades. This highlights thecontinued importance of banknotes as a store of value as well as a payment mechanism. So theupgrade of the notes is a major logistical exercise.The RBA is also the banker for the Australian Government. We operate the government's coreaccounts and we are the transactional banker for many government departments. So if you get aMedicare or tax refund, it comes from the government's accounts at the RBA.We operate the core of Australia's payments system. The way that money moves from one bankto another is through the accounts that financial institutions hold at the RBA. In addition, weoperate a key part of the infrastructure supporting Australia's new payments system, generallyreferred to as ‘the NPP’. This system allows you to move money between bank accounts in realtime on a 24/7 basis using an easily remembered ‘PayID’, such as a mobile number, to addressthe payment. BSBs and account numbers can still be used, but if you have not already done so, Iencourage you to contact your bank to register a PayID, which makes it easier to use the newsystem.The RBA also regulates key parts of Australia's financial market infrastructure, including thecentral counterparties at the ASX. In addition, we have broad responsibilities to promotecompetition, efficiency and stability in Australia's payments system. As a result of decisions ofthe Bank's Payments System Board there have been significant changes to the ATM and debitand credit card systems over recent times.The RBA also operates in financial markets every day to ensure the system as a whole hasadequate liquidity. We also have a broad responsibility for financial stability, including acting asthe lender of last resort in a financial crisis to provide liquidity to solvent institutions. Finally, wemanage Australia's foreign exchange reserves.These are all important functions that we carry out in the public interest. They are all critical to the 1 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
functioning of our successful modern economy and financial system. I can assure you, we takethese responsibilities very seriously. This means that even when interest rates are being heldsteady, we have a lot of things on our plate. But it is interest rates that mainly keep us in thenews.At its meeting this morning, the Board's assessment was that the Australian economy is movingin the right direction. Over the past year, GDP increased by 3.1 per cent and inflation was around2 per cent. The unemployment rate is currently 5.3 per cent, which is the lowest it has been innearly six years. In the broad sweep of our history, these are a pretty positive set of numbers.We will get another reading on the pulse of the economy tomorrow with the release of the Junequarter national accounts. We are expecting that this will confirm that over the first half of 2018,the economy expanded at a faster than trend pace, making inroads into spare capacity. Ourcentral scenario is that economic growth this year and next will be a bit above 3 per cent, whichshould see the unemployment rate come down further. So things are moving in the rightdirection.One of the factors helping us is that the global economy is expanding quite strongly. Many of theadvanced economies are growing quite strongly and unemployment rates in a number of themare at multi-decade lows. The Chinese economy is also growing solidly, although the pace ofgrowth has slowed, partly as a result of efforts to put the financial sector on a more sustainablefooting.The United States is most advanced in the process of monetary policy normalisation. This hasled to a broad-based appreciation of the US dollar this year. As a consequence, the Australiandollar has depreciated. If sustained, this could be expected to improve the outlook for bothinflation and growth.Notwithstanding the positive global picture, there are a number of international uncertainties thatwe are monitoring closely. One is the possibility of an escalation in the current trade disputes. Ifthis were to happen, it would materially affect trade flows and investment plans around the world.As a country that has benefited greatly from an open rules-based international system, Australiahas a strong interest in this not happening.Another uncertainty we are watching closely is the possibility of a material lift in inflation in theUnited States. The United States is experiencing a large fiscal stimulus at a time when theeconomy is at full employment and is growing quickly. This is an unusual combination to say thevery least. Past experience suggests that it could lead to inflation increasing significantly.Financial markets are, however, heavily discounting this possibility, which means that if it did takeplace it would come as quite a surprise, with repercussions for markets and the real economy.We are also monitoring carefully the financial and economic problems in a number of emergingmarket economies with structural or institutional weaknesses, including Turkey, Brazil andArgentina. If these problems were to escalate, they could put strains on parts of the globalfinancial system.So these are some of the international issues we are keeping an eye on at the moment.Domestically, the Board is closely monitoring housing markets across the country and trends inhousing finance. Housing credit growth has slowed, which, from a medium-term perspective, isa positive development. Our assessment is that this slowing largely reflects reduced demand forcredit by investors, although there has been some tightening in the supply of credit as well. Withhousing prices falling in a number of cities, largely due to a shift in the underlying fundamentals,investors no longer find it as attractive to invest in residential property as they once did. This is anormal part of the cycle. While credit standards have been tightened, mortgage credit remainsreadily available. 2 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
I would note that some banks have increased their mortgage rates recently in response tosomewhat higher interest rates in short-term wholesale markets. A much less remarked uponfact is that the average mortgage rate paid in Australia has fallen since August last year, aslenders have increased their discounts. I encourage anyone with a mortgage to shop around:there are some very good offerings out there. We can all play a role in promoting strongcompetition in our financial sector by shopping around and taking advantage of the good dealsthat are out there.Another set of issues that the Board continues to pay close attention to is the outlook for wagesgrowth and inflation. Wages growth has been quite low recently. For some time my view hasbeen that some increase in aggregate wages growth would be a welcome development,especially if it is backed by stronger productivity growth. Many business people that I speak torecognise that a pick-up in overall wages growth would be a positive development from a macroperspective, although not from the perspective of their individual business. So there is a tensionthere. Our expectation is that wages growth will pick up from here, but the pick-up is likely to beonly gradual. Firms are currently reporting a record number of job vacancies and increasinglytelling us that it is hard to find workers with the right skills. One way of dealing with this increasingtightness in the labour market is, of course, to lift wages. We expect that as this happens,inflation will also lift towards the midpoint of the medium-term inflation target, although this, too, islikely to be a gradual process.Against this background, this morning the Board again decided to keep the cash rate steady at1.5 per cent. We are seeking to be a source of stability and confidence, as further progress ismade towards full employment and having inflation return to around the midpoint of the targetrange. As that progress is made, you could expect the next move in interest rates to be up, notdown. This would be a sign that overall economic conditions are returning to normal and wouldtake place against the backdrop of stronger growth in household income. But any move stillseems some way off, given the gradual nature of the progress expected on unemployment andinflation.At this morning's meeting, as well as a thorough review of the international and Australianeconomies, we had a detailed discussion on the Western Australian economy. We pay closeattention to what is going on here: Western Australia accounts for a little over 14 per cent ofAustralian GDP and 35 per cent of our exports, so it is important. Reflecting this, this is my thirdtrip to, and public speech in, Perth in the past year.This morning we heard that while the Western Australian economy is still feeling the effects of adecline in the level of mining investment, there are some positive signs. The level of mininginvestment has further to fall as some large liquefied natural gas projects are completed. Butelsewhere in the resources sector things are looking brighter. Sustaining capital expenditure,particularly in the iron ore sector, is picking up with positive spillover effects. Higher prices for anumber of minerals have also led to increased exploration activity, including for gold and lithium,and an expansion of some existing mines is taking place. For the first time in a number of years,we are hearing reports through our liaison program in Western Australia that it is difficult for firmsto find workers with the right skills, including project engineers and related occupations. Businessconditions – as measured by surveys – have also risen significantly and are now above average.At our meeting, we also discussed the population dynamics here in Western Australia. At thepeak of the resources boom, annual population growth reached almost 3½ per cent, which isvery fast. People moved here from overseas and from the rest of Australia to meet the needs ofyour rapidly growing economy. In contrast, over the past year, population growth has slowedsharply, to around ¾ per cent, which is almost the slowest of any state in the country. There isnow a considerable net flow of people from Western Australia to the eastern states.This change in population dynamics has had a significant effect on housing markets in Western 3 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
Australia. The earlier strong growth in population contributed to a sharp rise in housing prices andrents, and then a bit later to a surge in housing construction. With the resources boom now in thepast, some of the earlier increases in prices and rents have been reversed and residentialconstruction activity has been low. Western Australia has seen this type of cycle before, and Iexpect it will see it again at some point in the future. Our liaison, though, suggests that astabilisation of conditions is in prospect. If so, this should help support consumer confidence andhousehold spending and reinforce the recent more positive news from the resources sector.Finally, as I mentioned earlier, we are currently upgrading Australia's banknotes. I am pleased tobe able to announce that the new $50 note will be released on 18 October. We are proud to havea prominent West Australian on this note – Edith Cowan – as well as the Aboriginal writer andinventor David Unaipon. The redesigned $50 note celebrates the fact that Edith Cowan was thevery first female member of an Australian Parliament. The microtext on the note will include anextract from her first speech to the Western Australian Parliament. When the note is released,those of you with great eyesight might be able to read this microtext without a microscope. Butfor those who will struggle to read it, I would like to quote a little from the text. In 1921 EdithCowan said:I stand here to-day in the unique position of being the first woman in an AustralianParliament… If men and women can work for the same state side by side andrepresent all the different sections of the community… I cannot doubt that we shoulddo very much better work in the community than was ever done before.Nearly one hundred years on, this sentiment is just as relevant as it was back in 1921. We areproud to have this text on the new $50 note and to recognise Edith Cowan's achievement. Thenote will also have a seating plan of today's Western Australian Legislative Assembly. It will alsorecognise Edith Cowan's lifelong advocacy of women. Western Australia's official bird emblem –the iconic black swan – will also appear on the note a number of times. If the note is tilted you willbe able to see the colour of the swan change and its wings move. So I am sure that people herein Western Australia will feel a great affinity for the note and enjoy spending it.Once again, thank you for joining us and please enjoy the evening. 4 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
  1  “Let’s dance”  Keynote speech Frank Elderson At the Global Capital Sustainable & Responsible Markets Forum  4 September 2018   At his keynote speech at the Global Capital Sustainable & Responsible Markets Forum, Frank Elderson shed his light on the ways central banks are contributing to the greening of the financial system.   
  2  I understand you have already had a very interesting morning. You have discussed a broad spectrum of climate-related topics. From the plastic polluting our oceans, to the nitty-gritty of the EU’s sustainable finance taxonomy.  It is a great pleasure to join today’s forum, which brings together market participants seeking solutions for greening their portfolios. But we are also here in a wider context, to support the Sustainable Development goals. It is a pleasure to be here in my capacity as chair of the NGFS. I noticed in the program a very small mistake. I don’t mean to be a nitpicker, but the acronym NGFS is explained there as ‘The Network ON Greening the Financial system’. I would like to be very precise here and highlight that we do not just aspire to be a network that merely speaks about a green economy… Or shares opinions on this. We aim to provide added value, and to actively support the creation of green markets. More so, it is our ambition to facilitate that the entire financial system can become green. Therefore, a Network FOR greening the financial system. Today you will get an insight into our work and progress. And I will describe how our activities fit within the broader context of international developments in this area. This should also give you, the private sector, a preview of what to expect in terms of regulation and supervision. I believe a stable and predictable regulator benefits everyone. But before I describe what we do and how we do it, let me first take you back to the WHY. Role central banks I don’t need to tell you that we face a climate problem. You all know that at the end of 2015 the international community came together to sign the Paris climate deal. It is clear we have to be greener. Clearer still is that this must be a joint effort. Globally. Across all sectors and segments of society.  It’s not just up to the end consumer to pick green energy over brown, or the utility company to provide green energy. Or the bank to finance the green utility company. It needs a concerted effort from all parties. But bringing about a green transformation requires enormous investment. And that means the financial sector – which is you, my friends! - has a crucial role in channeling its resources towards a green and sustainable economy.  And that is why there is an overwhelming case for supervisors and central banks to respond to environmental challenges. From the perspective of both risk and opportunity. Let me address the risk side first. Because as a supervisory authority, we tend to focus on risks. We are very sensitive to all types of risks to the stability of financial institutions, or to the system as a whole. So we also need to look at climate-related risks: we must assess how the physical effects of changing climate, like extreme weather events, can translate into financial risks for the institutions we supervise.  The same goes for risks that can arise from the transition to a low carbon economy. This transition may lead to stranded assets and policy risks, which in turn can mean financial risks for the institutions we supervise. We aim to 
  3  identify these risks. And where possible to manage, resolve or even mitigate them. And then there is the opportunity side. We supervisors do see sunny sides too, you know. Or at least we try to. I believe we must fulfill our responsibilities. As a supervisor, together with the financial sector, we must align our financial system with the sustainability goals. And we must support opportunities for green and sustainable finance. Of course, as a central bank and supervisor, we must not overstretch our mandate. But safeguarding sustainable prosperity falls well within our mission. This not only means financial institutions should have sufficient buffers to absorb unexpected losses. We also have to reexamine our current methods for creating prosperity. If these cause significant ecological damage, preventing future generations from obtaining similar or higher levels of prosperity, then how we create prosperity today is not sustainable either. This runs counter to our mission. There are ways we can impact investment decisions and credit allocation. Our supervisory policies could, for instance, take into account the transition to a low carbon economy. That’s why we as a central bank can help transform the financial infrastructure, so it facilitates the necessary flow of capital to where it is needed most. To help transform our economy into a low carbon one.  We should remove all unnecessary obstacles to this transition. And assist the sector in creating common definitions and standards. As well as provide the necessary guidance. The development of a sustainable taxonomy is a good example of this. I know, this is not a conventional area of focus for a central bank. So, like the private sector, we are developing new tools and methodologies to support us in this goal. And guess what! We are not the only central bank or supervisor exploring this new type of risk. Central banks and supervisors worldwide are studying these issues. Of course, there are trailblazers: You’re probably all aware of the Bank of England’s pioneering work in this area.  And this morning you discussed the EU taxonomy, which would take probably some time to enter into force. This is completely understandable for such a complex task. In this regard it is worthwhile to look at the Chinese approach for laying the foundation for green finance. They managed to develop a green taxonomy in just over two months! A remarkably short period of time. These are a couple of examples of countries that are ahead of the curve. At the other end of the spectrum are central banks, for which these issues are completely new to the agenda.  Background and membership of NGFS These developments laid the foundation for setting up the network of central bank and supervisors at the end of last year, the NGFS. (You remember, the network for greening the financial system…). It brings together institutions that are determined to move forward on green finance and climate-related risks.  
  4  Within the network we share experiences and best practices. This means we don’t all have to reinvent the wheel and are able to join forces. Since its launch in December 2017, the NGFS has experienced a rapid growth in terms of new members and observers. There were eight founding countries to begin with. But as chair I am proud to say we now have seventeen members and five observers. Hopefully, there are many more to come. And our members come from across the globe. It is not just a European party. No. All continents are represented. China, Singapore and Mexico were three of the founding members, as well as for example France and the UK.  This summer, the ECB, including the SSM, the Single Supervisory Mechanism, came on board. I expect this to have a major effect within Europe. The SSM directly supervises all one hundred and nineteen significant banks in the euro area and also indirectly supervises the less significant banks in this area. That means all countries in the banking union are indirectly linked to the NGFS. Members demonstrate a strong collective commitment to the greening of the financial system. They are taking up their responsibility to contribute to the implementation of the Paris Agreement. Now you might be thinking, what do we actually do? What impact are we trying to achieve? Activities NGFS members voluntarily exchange valuable experiences and best practices on climate risk analysis and mitigation tools. These activities are structured around three workflows: microprudential supervision; macrofinancial issues; and scaling up green finance. In terms of microprudential supervision, we study and identify best practices of central banks and supervisors in analyzing climate-related risks affecting individual institutions. We map current supervisory practices for integrating environmental risks into micro-prudential supervision. This forces individual institutions to consider the impacts on their balance sheet. We also review current practices on environmental and climate information disclosure by financial institutions so we can identify best practices. Secondly, we attempt to quantify the physical and transition risk at a macroeconomic level. Here, we will identify examples of good practices by NGFS members. These include for example macro stress tests or scenario analyses. Our last area of focus is the role of central banks in scaling up green finance. We discuss current practices for incorporating ESG criteria in all areas of central bank operational activities. Against this backdrop, the NGFS will organize the seminar ‘Sustainable & Responsible Investment for central banks’. The event will be hosted here at DNB, on the 21st of September. Then, we will discuss best practices and principles for integrating sustainability considerations into management of official reserves.    
  5  Concrete examples This might still sound a bit abstract in terms of what it could mean for you, for the financial sector. So let me return to the first area of activity: how can supervisors integrate climate risk into supervision? Last year, DNB examined the exposures of financial institutions to carbon intensive sectors. We published our findings in a report titled ‘Waterproof’. This gave us a good indication of the vulnerabilities in a hard transition scenario. We also looked at how new types of national policy could cause financial risks to materialize already in the shorter term.   A good example of this is in the Dutch commercial real estate sector. In the Netherlands, as of 2023, all office buildings will have to meet minimum energy efficiency requirements, or face closure. In 2017, it was estimated that half the offices in the Netherlands did not meet this requirement. This raises the prospect of write-offs for lenders. As I said, I strongly believe in predictable, transparent public institutions. This example shows how new policies to achieve our Dutch carbon emission goals require transparent implementation, to avoid sudden shocks. Annual data requests, as part of our supervision, could give greater insight into the size and nature of the risk. This can form the basis for supervisors to engage in dialogue with institutions. We may then expect them to prepare a strategy for integrating ESG risks in their short and longer term risk analyses. To explain how they can adapt their investment strategy to align with the Paris ambition. And to demonstrate they have a clear view on the viability of their business model in a two degree scenario.  In contrast to a supervisory dialogues, the one thing I believe we must not do, is to create wrong incentives. There are also advocates for changing capital requirements. To discourage brown exposures, or encourage green investments. However, we at DNB believe that capital requirements must essentially safeguard financial solidity and stability. Hence, without conclusive evidence that green exposures are less risky than other exposures, lowering capital requirements by introducing a green supporting factor will only increase the risks to financial stability. With evidence, the situation would change dramatically… We are not there yet. We need to work harder to determine the risk in “green”, but also in “brown” exposures. And to identify whether there exists any risk exposure differential between green and brown assets. This also is one of our focal areas in the NGFS. We can draw on the experience of all our members. And arrive at a common view. Also to safeguard a level playing field across prudential jurisdictions. Timelines NGFS Standing here now, I must say I’m very proud of the network’s progress. Ten months ago, the acronym NGFS still sounded odd. But today, we are right back on track and more and more countries are queuing up to board the train. It may run on only partly renewable sources at the moment, but hopefully in the near future it will be fully powered by certified green energy! And you will be able to assess 
  6  the extent to which we succeed. The analysis conducted in the work streams will feed into a NGFS report to be issued in the first half of 2019. The final purpose is to define and develop best practices and promote these such so they will be implemented within and outside of the membership of the NGFS.  Conclusion NGFS and DNB need to demonstrate they can support, underpin and promote the transition to a green financial system, as part of their regular mandate. And while our research on a possible future supervisory framework will continue, we’re excited by the initiatives that you, the private sector, have taken to model the risks and transform the financial markets. I believe you can drive innovation and might even be able to provide a more significant lever to advance global change. However, at a time of rapid change it is also important to analyse innovation within the public sector so as not to create new risks. So therefore, we hope to continue our dialogue and work on this challenge together. Or, in other words, as we are now in the ‘Grand Ballroom’ of the Okura hotel: Together, let us face the music and dance. Let’s dance together! Thank you. 
Yves Mersch: Strengthening the European financial industry amiddisruptive global challengesSpeech by Mr Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, atthe European Institute of Financial Regulation (EIFR), Paris, 3 September 2018.*   *   *Europe’s financial industry still faces a number of challenges. Its continued weak performance,with low price-to-book ratios and meagre profitability, is ample proof of that.Some of those challenges – such as high levels of legacy assets, the need for deleveraging andthe burden of stricter regulation – are a result of the financial crisis. But even before the financialcrisis, the industry was facing pressure on various fronts, and those challenges are still there. Inparticular, fundamental technological change continues to call established business models intoquestion.Today, I will focus on disruptive challenges that are arising in a particular area of business: digitaltechnology. Such technology is becoming ever more important in banking and is opening thedoor to competition from non-banks in core areas such as payments. Cascades ofcomplementary innovations have already fundamentally altered the payment landscape, andEuropean banks need to act now if they want to avoid losing out to bigger international players.The euro area has been very successful in providing a top-tier foundation for innovative paymentservices. However, this foundation has not yet been fully utilised by European players to providetrue stateof-the-art pan-European services. There is currently a window of opportunity forEurope’s financial industry to make use of this top-tier infrastructure and the changing patterns inretail payments. But in order to seize these opportunities, it needs to avoid the mistakes of thepast.Laying the foundationsThe euro was introduced in 1999, with physical banknotes and coins following in 2002. However,that success was not matched by integration in the market for electronic retail payments in euro,with national solutions remaining disparate and lacking interoperability. While the establishmentof TARGET, the real-time gross settlement system for the euro, resulted in a fully integratedmoney market and wholesale payment market, cross-border retail payments in euro remainedexpensive, slow and inefficient, with no standardised way of making electronic payments acrossthe euro area. For far too long, huge economies of scale remained unexploited.The ECB played a key role in laying the foundations for such standardised cross-borderpayments through the establishment of the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) – an endeavourthat required substantial efforts by all stakeholders. That initiative consisted of two key stages.First of all, a harmonised legal framework was needed for payment services in the EU. Thus, thePayment Services Directive (PSD) was adopted in 2007 and entered into force in 2009.Second, it was important to ensure that consumers and businesses in the EU could sendpayments to each other quickly and easily across borders, with no differences between domesticand non-domestic payments. The SEPA credit transfer and SEPA direct debit schemes replacedall domestic payment schemes in the euro area, using fully interoperable global standards.Catering for innovationIn the current age of rapid technological progress, it is vital to ensure that innovation delivered bybanks and non-banks reaches all European citizens. Innovative bespoke national solutions using 1 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
national – or, more frequently, non-European – technology could threaten the integrationachieved by the various SEPA schemes.Innovation may start at domestic level, but it should not face barriers preventing pan-Europeanexpansion. Thus, national solutions should provide for pan-European reach in their initial design.As these solutions tend to be provided by non-banks or disseminated by local banks on behalf ofnon-European entities, third-party providers need regulated access to payment accounts. Therevised Payment Services Directive (PSD2), which is currently in the process of beingimplemented, will provide secure and interoperable payment account access and will allowinnovative new payment services to be provided in the EU. What we don’t need is integration withnon-European countries that runs counter to European standards.While legislation is indispensable for an integrated market and to promote innovation, it is not theonly precondition. Cooperation between stakeholders is also essential in order to ensure smoothand harmonised processes throughout the EU.The ECB has brought the market together, initially via the SEPA Council and then via the EuroRetail Payments Board (ERPB). The ERPB was instrumental in the development of the SEPAinstant credit transfer scheme, which is now live, with over 1,000 providers participating. Thoseinstant payments have been achieved without legislation, with the ECB instead facilitatingdialogue and consensus between market actors.Moreover, that scheme will soon be complemented by the ECB’s new Target Instant PaymentSettlement service, which is set to go live this November, providing a real-time, high-end platformfor payment service innovation.The challenge for EuropeProgress towards an integrated market for payments has not been without its problems. Europestill does not have an integrated, standardised card payment network, with the vision of beingable to use any card at any payment terminal in Europe having yet to be realised.Europe’s largest card payment networks are still not interoperable. For example, Germany’sGirocard and France’s Cartes Bancaires account for a substantial number of card payments inthe euro area’s two largest economies. However, owing to significant technical differences, asupposed lack of a business case and an absence of political will, these two networks remainseparate – as do most other national card schemes. As a consequence, it is more convenient touse non-European cards when travelling across Europe.Although some standardisation work has been carried out via the European Cards StakeholdersGroup, Europe still does not have its own Europe-wide card scheme, so we remain fully relianton non-European schemes when making cross-border card payments. Although they provide avalued service, those schemes raise certain questions from a governance perspective.European banks have relinquished their influence in this area, possibly because of short-termprofit considerations.Indeed, large non-European companies now play a significant role in the provision of paymentservices in Europe, while European banks are focused solely on serving their national markets.Let’s face it: the foundations laid by European institutions have not been leveraged by Europeanproviders in order to offer panEuropean services. Instead, those foundations are often exploitedby multinationals from outside Europe offering innovative, consumer-friendly solutions. Indeed,European banks seem to have surrendered much of the panEuropean payment business.PayPal now dominates the market for online payments in Europe, using the pan-European SEPAcredit transfer and SEPA direct debit schemes to provide harmonised services. Meanwhile, 2 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon – often referred to collectively as “GAFA” – are alsooffering significant payment services with pan-European reach, some of which involve jointventures with individual banks at national level. At the same time, Chinese giants like Alibaba andTencent are advancing. While these companies are to be admired for their ability to expand andprovide innovative services that consumers want, I would ask why there are no Europeancompanies competing in that arena.There is a risk that our dependence on foreign providers will increase further as regards thedevelopment of innovative payment services, since banks are resisting the objectives of PSD2on this front. They have been defensive when it comes to granting technical access to new andinnovative payment service providers, which will limit European fintech companies’ ability toprovide competitive solutions. Indeed, I fear that global giants from outside Europe will use theirnetwork power to increase their presence further.In other sectors, European companies have succeeded in achieving global reach. In the carindustry, for example, European vehicles set the standard when it comes to quality and reliability.There is no reason why this success cannot be replicated in the area of payment services – orfinancial services in general.The way we pay in Europe is changing. Significant numbers of consumers are moving to onlinepayment channels, with retail payments increasingly being carried out via mobile phones. At thesame time, virtual currencies have long been a topic of debate – and not only among experts,either.European citizens demand pan-European services that are safe and efficient. Consequently,there is a need to look carefully at the governance and regulation of payment solutions. Manypayment channels are provided by non-European companies. Although those companies complywith our legislation and use our payment infrastructure, they are, for the most part, not domiciledin Europe. This increases our dependence on third countries. In particular, we have to be mindfulof the fact that extraterritorial jurisdiction could, in a worstcase scenario, affect the operation ofthose companies and disrupt payments between European counterparties. In the currentgeopolitical environment, such risks are, unfortunately, not as remote as they once were andneed to be taken seriously by European policymakers.ConclusionsWe have laid the groundwork by providing safe and efficient market infrastructure, and thisshould be used as a basis for innovative, user-friendly solutions. The way to protect the integrityof European payment services is not by closing them off to the world, but by making them globalplayers. Building on local or national solutions is anachronistic and will not meet the needs of themarket.If we are to succeed at a global level, the issue of domestic governance needs to be addressed.Our reliance on non-European card schemes for domestic payments in Europe is suboptimal.European card schemes should make interoperability and full pan-European reach their mainpriorities, enabling any card to be used at any terminal. At the same time, governancearrangements need to cater for European needs, given that cards are the single most importantelectronic payment instrument in Europe.However, protectionism should not be used to artificially promote European innovation inpayment services. We should remain open to global players, but should focus more onaddressing the reasons for the lack of major European providers in the payment market.It is important that European payment service providers are active at a global level. Rather thanestablishing national solutions, we should seek to develop global solutions based on Europeanopen governance that use European infrastructure. 3 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
Europe boasts state-of-the-art payment systems. They should be used by pan-Europeanproviders to offer innovative, safe and user-friendly solutions for the benefit of people acrossEurope and all over the world. 4 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
Jens Weidmann: Prospects for Europe and the euro areaSpeech by Dr Jens Weidmann, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank and Chairman of theBoard of Directors of the Bank for International Settlements, at the Centre for European Policy,Freiburg im Breisgau, 20 September 2018.*   *   *1 WelcomeProfessor Gerken,Ladies and gentlemen,I would like to thank you very much for inviting me to Freiburg.Two-and-a-half weeks ago I was a guest at the Konzerthaus just a few hundred metres fromhere. There, I delivered a speech at the annual meeting of the German Economic Association(Verein für Socialpolitik) on the challenges posed by digitalisation. Today I have returned tocontinue this series of talks on Europe.Freiburg is an ideal location for this topic. Here, on the doorsteps of France and Switzerland, wefind ourselves at the heart of Europe in more than just a geographical sense, as evidenced by thecity’s history.Some 650 years ago the city’s citizens rid themselves of the unpopular Counts of Freiburg andsubmitted to the Habsburgs for protection instead. Freiburg thus became part of an empire that,over time, became a European multinational state.Time and again, parallels are drawn between the Habsburg Monarchy and the EU. For example,historian Harold James wrote, "The EU looks more like the Habsburg Empire, a complex vesselof nationalities where satirists joked that the situation was desperate but not serious. When theempire fell 100 years later, it had lost the support of its people.Napoleon brought the Habsburgs’ rule in Freiburg to an end way back in 1805. But this era hasleft its mark on parts of the city to this day. Take a look, for instance, at the university or theaddress of the Centre for European Policy (cep): Kaiser-Joseph-Strasse 266.With an unquestionably pro-European stance and by employing its governance principles, cep isable to constructively and critically analyse institutions and processes in Europe.This is an approach that I can identify well with, namely because it’s not enough for Europe to bedear to your heart. Only a Europe that also works will appeal to its citizens in the long term.That’s why I think it is important for attention to be paid to the core principles ofOrdnungsökonomik or the "economics of order", such as the principle of liability and the primacyof foreign exchange policy.Otmar Issing made it clear in an interview: "Whoever voices concerns about the spread ofcentralism and interventionism is branded a bad European. But the reverse is true."Economic prosperity and a stable currency are key to ensuring backing for the European project.And a Europe that can find the answers to the burning questions of the hour – a Europe that canadd real value to the lives of its citizens – will also find backing and support.I would like to go into a little more detail about this outlook with you today. In particular, I willhighlight globalisation and technological progress, international trade policy and competition withChina as current challenges before moving on to discuss the role of the EU and reform steps for12 1 / 10BIS central bankers' speeches
the euro area. But I’d like to start by taking a brief look back. 2 Ten years after the financial crisisOver the past few days and weeks, a slew of media reports have reminded us of the events often years ago, when the financial crisis came to a tumultuous head with the collapse of LehmanBrothers.Many observers regard this as the climax of the crisis, which was followed by a global recessionin 2009. In terms of severity, there was no precedent for such a downturn in post-war history.In the euro area, the financial crisis later coalesced with the sovereign debt crisis. What’s more,the unemployment rate peaked at 12% in mid-2013. The rate has since fallen to 8.2% – but thisis not a value that we can content ourselves with.The member states hit especially hard by the crisis have made huge strides: they have reducednew government borrowing, cut their current account deficits, improved their competitivenessand implemented structural reforms.Take Greece, which, in 2008-09, had a vast current account deficit and a gaping hole in itsgeneral government budget – both of which reached 15% of GDP. Last year, however, thecurrent account was broadly balanced and a surplus was even recorded in the generalgovernment budget.All in all, five countries received financial support via assistance programmes with conditionsattached. A month ago today, Greece was also the last of these five countries to cast off thestatus of "programme country".Greece’s exit from the adjustment programme marks an important milestone. But it would bepremature to think of the crisis as over and done with. As I recently said in Athens, there is stillwork to be done.Continued structural reforms are needed to accelerate growth, create more jobs, and boost bothproductivity and wages – not just in Greece but in other euro area countries, too. By the way, wein Germany should not be content to merely ride the wave of the successful labour market andsocial reforms implemented in the 2000s.The institutional foundations of monetary union require further reform if the euro area is to bemade permanently crisis-proof. Because there’s one thing we can probably all agree on: none ofus want a repeat of the last ten years of crisis.The extensive rescue packages put together in recent years have triggered debates in thecountries providing assistance on the mutualisation of liability and intergovernmental transfers. Inthe countries receiving assistance, the conditions attached to the programmes were seen asvery severe in some cases and as outside interference in national decision-making. 3 A strong Europe: more important than everThe crisis in the euro area and the way in which it was resolved have also stirred up animosityand resentment and given a boost to anti-European movements. Decidedly euro-critical andpopulist parties have enjoyed electoral success in many member states. But this developmentcannot be put down to rescue measures alone, as populist movements are flourishing outsidethe euro area, too. 2 / 10BIS central bankers' speeches
Looking at the economic setting, this discontent may come as a surprise, what with the globaleconomy experiencing a robust upswing. In the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany andelsewhere, unemployment has fallen to its lowest level in decades.But it would seem that economic effects aren't the only significant factors at play here. Digitalchange and globalisation, for example, are transforming the way we live and work.Populist movements play on the fact that people perceive these profound changes as a threat.And I can understand that many people feel uneasy and cheated, and why they fear that theyhave lost control. "Take back control" – that was the motto of Brexit supporters.Walter Eucken once remarked, "People’s opinions, their mental attitudes, are often moreimportant as regards the direction of economic policy than economic facts themselves." 3.1 Globalisation and technological progressFrom an economic perspective, it is clear that technological progress and free trade boostgeneral prosperity in the long term. However, looking at the bigger picture obscures the fact thatemployment prospects and relative wages are shifting. Change brings with it winners and losers.Economists are now investigating the distributional effects of globalisation in greater detail.Studies show that China’s integration into the global economy played a particular role insubsequent massive manufacturing job losses in the United States.Now, these job losses may well have been more than offset by job creation in other sectors, butthese new jobs were often created in other places. Local labour markets have been seeminglyslow to adapt, and the lifetime income of affected workers has been markedly reduced.Looking at Germany, on the contrary, Wolfgang Dauth and his colleagues found that globalisationhas opened up important opportunities to export to eastern europe and China and thus helpedpreserve manufacturing jobs. But this, too, is an overall view of the situation.It is the job of politicians to create the conditions needed for new, future-proof jobs. People haveto be given the ability to meet today’s job requirements so that they, too, can reap the benefits ofglobalisation and digitalisation.Education will play a key role here, particularly since this issue affects employment prospects forlower-skilled workers. And wherever social hardship arises, a target-driven tax and transfersystem should step in and act as a cushion. 3.2 ProtectionismBy contrast, protectionism and isolationism are no way to create "prosperity for all".We are currently seeing international trade escalate to a new level. More than a year ago, theBundesbank was already drawing attention to the economic disadvantages and risks associatedwith a trade dispute in an edition of its Monthly Report.Simulations exercises conducted as part of a global economic model show that, by introducingnew tariffs, the United States runs the risk of damaging not least its own economy. That’sbecause higher prices would largely stifle the purchasing power of American consumers.Retaliatory tariffs introduced by trading partners would probably then make the deterioration inglobal economic activity and trade worse still. There are only losers in trade wars.3456 3 / 10BIS central bankers' speeches
Some politicians believe that higher tariffs will reduce current account deficits. However, themodel calculations show that this, too, could turn out to be fantasy. While new import tariffswould indeed reduce imports, foreign demand for exports would probably fall at the same time.And it is precisely a debtor country such as the United States that would probably feel theadditional strain of higher interest rates in the wake of upward price pressures.You'll no doubt know the song by Janis Joplin that goes as follows: "Oh Lord, won’t you buy me aMercedes Benz? My friends all drive Porsches, I must make amends."The song probably doesn’t feature on Donald Trump’s playlist. After all, the fact that Americanslike to drive German cars while Germans are not so impressed by American ones is a thorn inhis side.But as long as it is an expression of consumer preference, it does not constitute market orcompetition distortion. At the end of the day, there are also American products and services thatare in very high demand in Germany – in the IT and mobile sectors, for instance, or the internetsearch engine industry, to name just a few.It is also difficult to pin market distortions on trade or current account balances. All in all, thecurrent account balance reflects the countless saving and investment decisions made within aneconomy.In addition to the decisions made by enterprises and households, fiscal policy plays a role here.Simulation exercises conducted by the Bundesbank reveal that the tax cuts passed in the UnitedStates will probably push up debt and current account deficit levels considerably. This will donothing to reduce global imbalances.Furthermore, given the diversity of economic relationships and level of interconnectedness withthird countries, looking at the goods traded between two countries alone is insufficient. Tradeexpert Gabriel Felbermayr pointed out that, overall, the United States actually has a currentaccount surplus with the EU: income from services and primary income more than compensatefor its trade in goods deficit.Felbermayr also wrote, "The EU is in no way a paradise for advocates of free trade, especiallywhen compared to the United States." For 48% of all products, the EU imposes a higher tariffthan the United States, while the reverse is true for 30% of products.It is a welcome development that the two sides are now discussing how to dismantle tradebarriers. Lowering tariffs would boost welfare and benefit consumers, in particular.For example, a study carried out by the European Commission shows that consumers havesaved €60 billion a year since the 1990s as a result of tariff reductions. Nowadays, thanks to theconclusion of a free trade agreement, purchasing a car from Korea with an import value of€13,300 is tariff-free, but a 10% import tariff that was previously in place would have resulted inadditional costs amounting to €1,300.Germany is quite rightly determined in calling for free trade in goods. With that in mind,restrictions on capital flows are something that is difficult to reconcile with this. 3.3 Competition with ChinaAnd yet we are currently seeing a debate in Germany over the extent to which takeovers fromabroad need to be regulated more tightly. Takeovers by Chinese investors are viewed withparticular concern, for fear of a state-orchestrated transfer of expertise and technology to China.78910 4 / 10BIS central bankers' speeches
Then again, German foreign direct investment in China is still 16 times higher than in theopposite direction, so that ought to ease some of the fears that a "wave of takeovers" by Chineseinvestors is washing over Germany. If you ask me, we ought to take a measured approach hereand be wary of "investment protectionism".Dieter Kempf, President of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has warned thatgovernment intervention to prevent investment from abroad will always pose a challenge to ourgovernance principles, which we have to thank for prosperity and a highly innovative and globallycompetitive national economy.Rather than adopting special measures to fend off Chinese investors, I think it would be better towork towards developing suitable multilateral rules and a level playing field in matters of marketaccess.Another important measure would be to press for compliance with the existing rules. Unfairtrading practices such as dumping cannot be tolerated. In the steel sector, especially, thatappears to be a problem in connection with overcapacities in China.At a fundamental level, China's economic ascendency is, for some, shaking our firmly held beliefthat the liberal trinity – democracy, the rule of law, and the market economy – is not just morehumane, but also more successful, economically, than any other system. Clemens Fuest hasspoken of a "third competition among systems" emerging between the Western democraciesand China’s authoritarian state capitalism.In the meantime, the breath-taking pace with which China has made up ground has slowed downsignificantly. Economic growth there has halved from 14% in 2007 to just under 7% last year.One major reason for this is that the export-oriented growth model has reached its limits. On thedemand side, the absorptive capacity of the global market is acting as a constraint.Ultimately, China’s economy is quite simply too big to continue growing at a perceptible pace onthe back of exports to the rest of the world.The country is now experiencing an altogether difficult process of transformation into a morebalanced demand-based economy in which private consumption plays a greater role.The Bundesbank looked in greater detail at this process and the problems it involved in the July2018 edition of its Monthly Report. Over the past years, China’s extremely expansionarymonetary policy has fuelled a veritable credit boom. Credit was channelled in particular to state-owned enterprises whose investments have never really been all that productive. Significantovercapacities built up in certain industrial sectors, such as steel manufacturing.One could argue that the state capitalism characteristic of the Chinese system, especially, ismore of a weakness than a strength. That’s a point confirmed by Mr von Hayek, who said thefollowing at his inaugural lecture here at the University of Freiburg. The fact that far moreknowledge about facts is fed into a market economy system than any one person or even anyone organisation can know is the crucial reason why the market economy does more than anyother economic system.That is one reason why I firmly believe that we are still on the right path with our social marketeconomy, our open democracy, and our liberal rule of law.China has ambitious international plans, not least with its Belt and Road Initiative. At the sametime, the United States is forging links between national security interests and international tradepolicy.In this difficult situation, what we need here in Europe is a strong EU – not only to stand up for our1112131415 5 / 10BIS central bankers' speeches
own interests at the negotiating table, but also to preserve and refine the multilateral rules-basedtrade order.Tuesday saw the European Commission present a concept paper for reforming the World TradeOrganization (WTO). One point this paper makes is that the WTO should do more to addressforced technology transfer and market-distorting government support channelled through state-owned enterprises. And last week Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker used a speechbefore the European Parliament to say that it was time for Europe to develop what he calledWeltpolitikfähigkeit – a term he defined as "the capacity to play a role, as a Union, in shapingglobal affairs". In his words, "United, as a Union, Europe is a force to be reckoned with." 4 Focus of the European UnionLadies and gentlemen,Brexit does indeed represent a step backwards on the European path.For the EU, the United Kingdom’s exit – whether it is a hard or a soft one – will be a painful loss.Germany, especially, shares many of the same beliefs as the UK, such as the merits of marketeconomy incentives and open markets.But we also need to see Brexit as a wake-up call. For one thing, the public at large need to begiven a clearer vision of what benefits European solutions can deliver. For another, there is alsothe underlying question of the right division of responsibilities between the European and nationallevels.Both of these aspects suggest to me that the EU needs to be geared more than ever to reapingthe rewards of acting as one. That is why I welcome the European Commission’s plans to focuson areas in which the EU can add real value.There are many tasks that can be performed better at the European level than the national. Froman economic vantage point, efforts should concentrate on Europe-wide public goods and policyareas with cross-border externalities.Nearly a year ago to this day, French President Emmanuel Macron used his speech at theSorbonne to single out defence, border security, migration policy, climate protection, and theexpansion of digital networks as areas where he could clearly see Europe adding value.A common asylum policy would also help ease the pressure on individual countries which areparticularly exposed on account of their locations. Helping people in need is a task that can donebetter by pulling together, so that the burden does not become too much for any one country.Note, though, that providing European public goods generally comes with a price tag attached.So once the European to-do list has been drawn up, the question of how the items will befinanced needs to be addressed. Germany – unlike other net contributors – has already declaredits willingness to put more towards the EU budget.That said, what counts here is that Europe’s general public does not get saddled with even moretaxes and public levies than hitherto. And we should continue to steer clear of giving the EU theright to raise debt. With member states already labouring under high levels of generalgovernment debt, it would be wrong for the public sector to create even more borrowingopportunities.Let’s not forget that the crisis that engulfed the euro area was a sovereign debt crisis. And thatbrings me to the final part of my speech here today, in which I will turn my attention to the euro16 6 / 10BIS central bankers' speeches
area. 5 Reforming the euro areaTo prevent the sovereign debt crisis from escalating, financially distressed member states weregranted assistance loans in the shape of the euro rescue package. But the crisis also forced theEurosystem to adopt stabilising measures that caused monetary policy to test the very limits ofits mandate. You could say the central banks became the crisis response team tackling the blaze. But in theinterests of monetary stability, that’s something that should not become a habit. Hence the hugeimportance of forging a crisis-proof regulatory framework in the euro area for the Eurosystem.Then the central bank would be able to credibly focus on its mandate rather than having to putout the fire on behalf of all those that claim that their hands are tied.Now, there have been a number of improvements at the institutional level since the crisiserupted. The ESM can grant conditional financial aid to member states in the event of a crisisand thus prevent a national crisis from jeopardising the stability of the entire euro area financialsystem.Another step forward was the creation of the banking union. Thus far, it is composed of a singlesupervisory mechanism, a single resolution mechanism, and harmonised national depositguarantee schemes.These reforms remedied weaknesses in the architecture of the euro area that had either beenignored or overlooked when the euro was founded.These measures restored stability in the euro area – there's no doubt about that. But they haven'tmade it crisis-proof once and for all. And that is why no one doubts that further reform steps arein order. Whatever shape these steps take, the regulatory framework of monetary union needs tobe designed in such a way that actions and liability for their consequences are aligned.Originally, there was a clearly defined allocation of responsibilities, with the Maastricht Treatystating that fiscal policy was a matter of national ownership. And the no-bail-out clause (which istoday Article 125 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union) went as far as toexplicitly prevent member states from assuming liability for each other’s debts. Action andliability, then, were located at the national level.As a measure of last resort, the no-bail-out clause states that it must be possible to impose ahaircut. That’s something that creditors need to be aware of.I imagine the architects of monetary union will have thought this an unlikely scenario. They did,after all, assume that financial markets and the rules on debt would exert enough of a disciplinaryinfluence.But the onset of the sovereign debt crisis put paid to that notion. The no-bail-out clause lackscredibility. Even highly indebted member states did not have to pay much in the way of riskpremiums in the years leading up to the crisis. And the rules on debt were too tame, not leastbecause Germany, together with France, took the sting out of the Stability Pact early on.The first step towards a functioning Maastricht framework is to restore the credibility of the no-bail-out rule. It must be possible to reschedule or restructure sovereign debt without crippling thefinancial system.Real progress could be made on this front by automatically extending government bond 7 / 10BIS central bankers' speeches
maturities in conjunction with an orderly restructuring regime, and by abolishing the preferentialregulatory treatment afforded to government bonds.The idea of automatically extending bond maturities when assistance is requested under theESM rescue programme is to keep private investors on the hook when a member state receivesassistance loans. Clemens Fuest has stressed that this might prevent private creditors frommaking a quick getaway at the taxpayer’s expense if a crisis strikes.A more appropriate regulatory regime for sovereign risk would encourage banks to stop holdingas much government debt – particularly paper issued by their home countries – and to set asidemore capital to cushion losses. That would make a sovereign debt restructuring episode moremanageable for the banking system.Furthermore, two measures need to be taken to make the rules on debt more binding.First, it would be helpful for the rules of the Stability Pact to be simplified. One expert in publicfinances, Friedrich Heinemann, has remarked that the official manual illustrating the rules of thepact is more than 200 pages long, and that the various sorts of escape clauses offer a wealth ofarguments for justifying high levels of debt.So the proposals to simplify the fiscal rules, as recently tabled by Germany’s Council of Expertsand its French counterpart, are a welcome sign. What matters at the end of the day is that thesekinds of rules are complied with and that they help swiftly reduce the high debt-to-GDP ratios. As for the second measure, a more rigorous interpretation of the rules could be achieved bygiving responsibility for fiscal surveillance to an independent authority instead of to theCommission. An institution equipped with a clear mandate to guarantee sustainable publicfinances would not be torn between that mission and the need to achieve other policy goals atthe same time.Ladies and gentlemen,I must admit that the current reform debate isn’t exactly being driven by the idea of strengtheningnational ownership.Quite the opposite: there is another idea which is constantly coming to the fore – risk sharing. Beit a European deposit insurance scheme, a facility to cushion asymmetric shocks, or the idea ofconverting the ESM into a European Monetary Fund, all these proposals are based on theunderlying assumption that the euro area would be more stable if its members agreed to sharerisk.But the same goes for these proposals, too: they will only deliver stability if actions and liability fortheir consequences are in alignment. After all, responsible decisions are only likely to be made ifthe economic consequences are borne by the decision-makers themselves, and by no one else.Joint liability, then, can only work if decision-making powers are surrendered and legacy assetsare scaled back.Viewed purely in isolation, the existence of a single supervisory mechanism would support theidea of creating a European deposit insurance arrangement. This would help make the financialsystem more stable since it would reduce the likelihood of bank runs.On the other hand, the national level is still home to key policy areas which have a bearing on therisks carried on bank balance sheets, such as insolvency regimes. Moreover, bank balancesheets are still riddled with exposures that arose under national ownership. I’m referring here tothe very high stocks of non-performing loans in some quarters. But the large holdings of1718 8 / 10BIS central bankers' speeches
government bonds on bank balance sheets are also problematic.Risks that arose under national responsibility should not be communitised. After all, as anindividual you can't usually take out insurance for damage that has already occurred.That’s why, before a deposit insurance scheme can be created, sovereign default risks on bankbalance sheets would need to be reduced on a lasting basis, as would the stocks of non-performing loans. And looking to the future, it would be important to prevent new risks frombuilding up in the first place. Staying with the insurance analogy I just mentioned, and given thatmember states will still have a bearing on the health of bank balance sheets in future, theconcept of a long-term national risk retention requirement also seems worth considering.But leaving aside the banking union, there would appear to be no great interest among memberstates of the euro area to surrender substantial sovereignty rights to Brussels, such as thepower to intervene in national fiscal autonomy. That's why this is another area where it would bepremature to communitise liability and share risk. 6 ConclusionLadies and gentlemen,A century ago, Oswald Spengler prophesised the "Decline of the West". That decline has failedto materialise, just like the collapse of capitalism that Karl Marx had once predicted, or the "Endof History" thesis posited by Francis Fukuyama.Events these days revolve around China, trade disputes, geopolitical conflicts, the refugee crisis,Brexit, populism, globalisation, digitalisation and demographic change. Some may see thechallenges facing Europe and our open society and paint a bleak future that they are powerlessto change.But Karl Popper’s words show us a different path: "The future depends on ourselves, and we donot depend on any historical necessity."I am certain that we Europeans together have the strength to overcome the challenges of ourtime. We need to remedy the flaws that have come to light in the euro area and take Brexit as acue to strengthen and focus the European Union.Thank you for your attention. I look forward to the discussion.H. James, Viel zu komplex, Handelsblatt, 5 September 2018, p. 48.O.

Mario Draghi: Hearing of the Committee on Economic and MonetaryAffairs of the European ParliamentIntroductory statement by Mr Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, at the ECONcommittee of the European Parliament, Brussels, 24 September 2018.*   *   *Mr Chairman,Honourable members of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee,Ladies and gentlemen,It is a pleasure to be back at the European Parliament before your Committee.Ten years ago, the euro area entered a severe recession. That crisis exposed structuralweaknesses and forced us to address them. The work is not yet over, but we are reaping thebenefits of our efforts: growth has been positive for more than five years, and the unemploymentrate is at its lowest level since November 2008.In my remarks today, I will discuss the current economic environment and the role that the ECB’smonetary policy plays in it. At the request of your Committee, I will also discuss central bankcommunication, which nowadays forms an integral part of monetary policy.The euro area outlookThe information that has become available since my last visit in July broadly confirms an ongoingbroad-based expansion of the euro area economy, which grew by 0.4% in the second quarter of2018. Despite some moderation following the strong growth performance in 2017, the economycontinues to exhibit high levels of capacity utilisation, and labour markets are tightening withsigns of labour shortages in some countries and sectors. This is reflected in the unemploymentrate in the euro area, which stood at 8.2% in July. Since reaching a trough five years ago, euroarea employment has increased by about 9.2 million. On account of the improving labour marketand overall conditions, households’ disposable income in the euro area is currently growing atthe highest rates observed in the last ten years. Higher income supports private consumption,which is expected to increase by 1.5% in 2018. These factors, together with business investmentbeing fostered by the favourable financing conditions, rising corporate profitability and soliddemand, continue to support spending.Looking ahead, the latest ECB staff macroeconomic projections confirm the outlook forcontinued broad-based growth of the euro area economy. Average annual growth is foreseen tobe 2.0% in 2018, 1.8% in 2019 and 1.7% in 2020, with a slight downward revision for 2018 and2019, mainly reflecting weaker global trade. Risks surrounding the euro area outlook can still beviewed as broadly balanced, although the threat of protectionism, vulnerabilities in emergingmarkets and financial market volatility have become more prominent recently. Fiscal policies inseveral euro area countries might be less neutral than we expected some time ago.Regarding inflation developments, HICP inflation stood at 2.0% in August, down from 2.1% inJuly. Headline inflation remains somewhat higher than in the first months of the year, reflectingthe strong increase in oil prices. Measures of underlying inflation remain generally muted buthave been increasing from earlier lows as domestic price pressures are strengthening andbroadening. Underlying inflation is expected to increase further over the coming months as thetightening labour market is pushing up wage growth. For example, annual growth in negotiatedwages in the euro area increased from 1.5% in 2017 to 1.7% in the first quarter to 2018 and to2.2% in the second quarter. This supports our confidence that the pick-up in wage growth will 1 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
continue, as wage agreements often last two years or more.Looking forward, annual rates of HICP inflation are likely to hover around current levels in thecoming months and are projected to reach 1.7% in each year between now and 2020. Thisstable profile conceals a slowing contribution from the non-core components of the generalindex, and a relatively vigorous pick-up in underlying inflation. Reflecting these dynamics, theECB projections foresee inflation excluding food and energy reaching 1.8% in 2020.The ECB’s monetary policy and its effectivenessOverall, recent developments vindicate the Governing Council’s earlier assessments of themedium-term inflation outlook. Accordingly, at our last meeting the Governing Council decided tomaintain the significant monetary policy stimulus in its present configuration and, in line with theconditional plan announced at our press conference in June in Riga, to reduce the monthly paceof net asset purchases to €15 billion from October until the end of the year. We anticipate that,subject to incoming data confirming our medium-term inflation outlook, we will then end netpurchases.This doesn't mean that our monetary policy will cease to be accommodative. For our baselineexpectations of a rising inflation path to materialise, we need to remain patient, prudent andpersistent in calibrating the monetary policy stance. In line with this approach, we will continue toprovide substantial monetary stimulus by combining three policy measures: first, our enhancedforward guidance on the key ECB interest rates, which we expect to remain at present levels atleast through the summer next year, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure thecontinued convergence of inflation towards our aim; second, the residual net asset purchasesthat we will be conducting until the end of this year; and third, the reinvestment of the sizeablestock of acquired securities.Our monetary policy measures have made a very substantial contribution to the positiveeconomic developments in the euro area. If we consider all the policy measures taken since mid-2014, our staff estimates show that the overall impact on euro area real GDP growth and euroarea inflation is – in both cases – around 1.9 percentage points cumulatively between 2016 and2020.Importance of central bank communicationLet me now turn to the topic of central bank communication that you suggested for today’smeeting.Regarding this topic, forward guidance has indeed become an important instrument for all majorcentral banks as conventional monetary tools have reached their effective lower bound, and theECB is no exception.Forward guidance on our policy interest rates has evolved considerably over time, since we firstintroduced it in July 2013.Roughly speaking, it has gone through three phases. When we first gave forward guidance in2013, our goal was to insulate euro area financing conditions, and especially the near-termsegment of the term structure of money market interest rates, from the heightened volatilityemanating from the US money market as a result of the “taper tantrum” episode of May-June2013.During the second phase, our forward guidance served to reinforce the effectiveness of the netasset purchases. By expressing the Governing Council’s expectations about the likely future pathof interest rates, we ensured that the downward impact that the asset purchases were exertingon longer-term yields was not counteracted by unanchored market expectations of short-term 2 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
interest rate increases.Since June 2018 we have expressed our expectation that, subject to incoming data confirmingour medium-term inflation outlook, net purchases will likely end after December 2018. As we hadfor some time tied the horizon for our rate path to the end of our net purchases – givingindications that interest rates will remain at their present levels “well past the end of our netpurchases” – announcing a conditional plan for terminating net purchases by a certain datemade it necessary for us to re-anchor the rate guidance. Steering expectations of the policy ratepath was critical because the path of inflation that the Governing Council viewed as movingcloser to the objective of a sustained adjustment was – and still is – conditional on a termstructure of interest rates that embodies expectations of constant policy rates over an extendedperiod of time after December 2018.It was important for us to retain firm control over the signalling implicit in our monetary policyannouncements. At that critical juncture, we had to reassure investors and the public that thelikely change in the course of our asset purchases will not stymie the recovery and frustrateprogress toward inflation normalisation.With this in mind, in June 2018 we said that we expected interest rates to remain at their presentlevels “at least through the summer of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensurethat the evolution of inflation remains aligned with our current expectations of a sustainedadjustment path”. This rate guidance, which we reasserted back in July and also this month,actually contains two parts: first, the “through the summer of 2019” formulation is a calendar-based element, which refers to when we anticipate conditions that might warrant a first rateincrease; and second, a state-dependent component, indicating our expectation that rates willremain unchanged in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustainedconvergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.As it turned out, the realignment of market expectations with those of the Governing Council wasimmediate and smooth. The new formulation has helped market participants to better understandour reaction function and adjust the outlook on which they base their plans accordingly.Of course, steering financing conditions – by guiding the expectations of market professionals –is only part of our task. We are responsible for ensuring price stability for the 340 million peopleof the euro area who use the euro and make economic decisions every day.Reaching out to citizens is the key to maintaining public confidence in their central bank, and inthe appropriateness and efficacy of its policies. In this respect, hearings before the EuropeanParliament are a fundamental – absolutely fundamental – channel through which we can explainto the people of Europe the reasons for our decisions and how those decisions impact their lives.The ECB and the European Parliament, building on the framework enshrined in primary law,have responded to the demand for stronger scrutiny that arose during the crisis and haveensured a high degree of accountability throughout it. Nevertheless, this should be no reason forcomplacency. We are well aware that maintaining people’s trust in the ECB calls for tirelessefforts on our side.Facing challenging times, we have sought to enhance understanding of our decisions. Forinstance, since January 2015 the ECB has been publishing regular accounts of the GoverningCouncil’s monetary policy discussions. As the exchanges and conversations we have in thisroom testify, this additional set of information enables you – and anyone who is interested in theconduct of monetary policy – to enhance scrutiny of the ECB’s policies. At the same time, thishas provided us with greater opportunities to explain our decisions and demonstrate that we areacting in accordance with our democratic mandate.Over the past few years, we have also stepped up our efforts to overcome the keycommunication challenges posed by the euro area structure, namely reaching out to citizens in1 3 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
19 countries, who naturally have different expectations regarding the ECB. We have thusenhanced our communication strategy, directly addressing a wider range of audiences. Inaddition to our institutional activities, my fellow Executive Board members and I have participatedin about 180 events over the last two years, a quarter of them in centres of education.If I include think tanks, foundations, non-profit organisations and governmental bodies, wedelivered more speeches to these fora than at the ECB and the NCBs. ECB staff members havecomplemented these efforts with a dedicated outreach programme aimed specifically atsecondary schools and universities which goes into the functions and purpose of a central bankin an advanced economy, and also explains the financial crisis and the ECB’s role in alleviatingits effects on the people of Europe. We have covered similar ground in our expanded website,which now features videos, explainers and charts that describe complex issues in an accessibleway. We have started using new tools, such as YouTube and LinkedIn, as well as Twitter, wherewe have almost 440,000 followers. The European Parliament, which represents EU citizens, is the key to fostering people’sunderstanding of and trust in ECB decisions. In this sense, it contributes to the effectiveness ofour monetary policy.But your contribution, as parliamentarians, does not end here. You, as co-legislators, have a roleto play in making sure that Europe is well prepared if the risks I mentioned in my introductionwere to materialise. We have seen that, far from damaging growth, a strong regulatoryframework is essential in ensuring strong long-term economic performance.Today, ten years since the start of the financial crisis, there is still important unfinished businesswhen it comes to improving the EU financial legislative framework. As we are approaching theend of this legislative term, we need to seize the opportunity now. I thus count on theParliament’s support to make sure that the framework provides the necessary stability to themarkets, thus protecting EU citizens, as customers, workers and taxpayers.Thank you for your attention. I am at your disposal for questions.The ECB and the European Parliament have increased the frequency of their interactions, made innovationsregarding the format and sharpened the focus of their exchanges.

Others wouldinclude funds they have on deposit at a bank. Some might contemplate broader measures of theirwealth. Historians would be tempted to tell us about the role of precious metals, coins, salt, shellsand even rum when the topic of money is raised. When thinking about the role that money plays inan economy, economics teachers and academics might educate us about money multipliers, thevelocity of money and money demand and supply functions. Keen students of episodes of highinflation would discuss Milton Friedman and the notion that inflation is ‘always and everywhere’ amonetary phenomenon. Given this, concerned citizens might be worried about what they see as theability of private banks to create money via the extension of credit, seemingly at will.While there are many interesting aspects of money, today I want to focus on the questions of howmoney is created and how money relates to lending or credit. Along the way, I'll also review what'sbeen happening to both money and credit in Australia over recent decades. The process of moneycreation is often subject to a degree of confusion, in part because the explanation draws upon acombination of disciplines – accounting, banking and economics.What Is Money?It is relatively standard practice to define money according to its ability to do each of the followingthree things:money can be used for transactions – it facilitates the exchange of goods, services or assetsthereby avoiding the substantial costs associated with bartermoney is a store of value – it's worth does not fluctuate wildly, nor does it degrade rapidly overtime, and [*]
20/09/2018Money – Born of Credit? | Speeches | RBAhttps://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2018/sp-ag-2018-09-19.html2/16money acts as a commonly accepted unit of account – it provides a convenient means ofcomparing the value of a range of different goods, services or assets.Banknotes and coins – otherwise known as currency – satisfy each of these functions. Currency longago pushed aside other physical forms of money.Currently, there is around $75 billion of currency in circulation in Australia (outside of the bankingsystem). However, despite its usefulness, currency represents only a small share of money inmodern economies.Most money consists of deposits in banks, building societies and credit unions (simply referred tohere as banks). Just as I can pay for my morning coffee using currency, I can also transfer funds inmy bank deposit to the café's account. In either case, the café owner receives a liquid store of valuewhich they are confident will be accepted by others.Not all bank deposits are equally liquid – for instance, it can take some time to gain access to fundsin a term deposit. For this reason, it is common to construct a range of different ‘monetaryaggregates’, from the more liquid narrower forms of money – such as M1, which includes currencyand current deposits at banks – to ‘broad money’, which also captures less liquid deposits and otherfinancial products that share the characteristics of money discussed earlier (Table 1; Graph 1); forexample, broad money includes certificates of deposit or short-term debt securities. For convenience,in what follows I'm going to focus on broad money.Table 1: Monetary AggregatesMeasureDescriptionCurrencyNotes and coins held by the private non-bank sectorMoney baseCurrency + banks' holdings of notes and coins + deposits of banks with the Reserve Bank +other Reserve Bank liabilities to the private non-bank sectorM1Currency + current (cheque) deposits of the private non-bank sector at banksM3M1 + all other deposits of the private sector at banks (including certificates of deposit) exceptdeposits of authorised deposit-taking institutions (ADIs) + all deposits of the private non-ADIsector at credit unions and building societies (CUBS)Broad moneyM3 + other deposit-like borrowings of all financial intermediaries (AFIs) from the non-AFI privatesector (such as short-term debt securities)(a) These descriptions abstract from some detail.

It includes currency, deposits and deposit-like products. Unlike ancient forms ofphysical money – think shells or gold found in the natural environment – these are liabilities issuedby authorised deposit-taking institutions (ADIs) and other financial intermediaries. Broad moneyin Australia is currently around $2 trillion or 115 per cent of the value of annual economic output asmeasured by nominal GDP; most of that is in the form of banking deposits. Over the past decade,the share of broad money represented by term and other bank deposits has increased in importanceat the expense of holdings of current deposits and other borrowings from the private sector.How Is Money ‘Created’?Australia's banknotes are produced by the Reserve Bank of Australia and account for most (about95 per cent) of the value of Australian currency. The rest is accounted for by coins produced by theRoyal Australian Mint.Banks purchase banknotes from the Reserve Bank as required to meet demand from their customersand, in turn, the Reserve Bank ensures that it has sufficient banknotes on hand to meet thatdemand. Previous research by the Reserve Bank points to a number of drivers of demand forbanknotes. The most important is the size of the economy. This is consistent with people holdingsome fraction of their income in this most liquid form of money in order to undertaketransactions. Some share of demand is also accounted for by the desire for a liquid store ofwealth. The value of banknotes in circulation as a share of nominal GDP has actually increased overrecent years (to around 4 per cent), which suggests that this source of demand has grown strongly.

20/09/2018Money – Born of Credit? | Speeches | RBAhttps://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2018/sp-ag-2018-09-19.html4/16This increase has been observed in a range of countries and is consistent with the low level ofinterest rates, which has reduced the opportunity cost of holding money (compared with holdinginterest-bearing deposits).When customers withdraw currency from an ATM or a bank branch, the value of their depositholdings declines and the value of their currency holdings increases. The stock of broad money,however, is unchanged.As I mentioned earlier, the vast bulk of broad money consists of bank deposits. These bankingliabilities are created when an Australian household or business has funds credited to their depositaccount at an Australian bank. One way this can occur, for example, is when a business depositscurrency it has earned with its bank. Again, such transactions add to deposits but do not createmoney because the bank customer is simply exchanging one type of money (currency) for another (adeposit).Money can be created, however, when financial intermediaries make loans. Accordingly, the conceptsof money and credit are closely linked in a modern economy, albeit not one for one. When a bankextends a loan, it makes money available to the borrower, for example, to buy a car, a house orequipment for a business. The bank may credit the deposit account of the borrower, who withdrawsthe funds to make their purchase. Alternatively, the bank may directly credit the deposit account ofthe seller on behalf of the borrower. In either case, the loaned funds will tend to find their way into adeposit somewhere in the banking system. This process adds to the supply of money.If I stopped here, you might be left with the impression that the process of lending allows thebanking system to create endless quantities of money at no cost. However, the process of moneycreation is constrained in numerous ways and depends on the behaviour of borrowers, banks andregulators, as well as the stance of monetary policy.In the first instance, the process of money creation requires a willing borrower. That demand willdepend, among other things, on prevailing interest rates as well as broader economic conditions.Other things equal, lower interest rates or stronger overall economic conditions will tend to supportthe demand for credit, and vice versa.The bank then has to be willing and able to issue the loan:It has to satisfy itself that the borrower can service the loan.The bank must maintain a sufficient share of its assets in liquid form to meet any drawdownsrelating to the new loan, as well as meeting any withdrawals from existing depositors.Otherwise, the bank runs the risk of failing to meet its obligations when they fall due.The bank's loans and other assets need to be backed by adequate capital. Capital is needed toabsorb unexpected losses arising from defaults or other sources of variation in the value of assets.The interest rates charged on loans must cover expected losses on the loan portfolio, as well asthe costs of deposits and other sources of funding. Revenues from loans and other assets will also [5]
20/09/2018Money – Born of Credit? | Speeches | RBAhttps://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2018/sp-ag-2018-09-19.html5/16have to cover the operating costs of the bank, while allowing it to earn a profit so thatshareholders can earn a reasonable return on the bank's capital.All of these considerations imply that money creation occurs at some cost, which serves to constrainthe extent of lending. These constraints are reinforced by regulatory requirements for liquidity,capital adequacy and lending standards set by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. Otherthings equal, anything that reduces the willingness or ability of banks to make loans can be expectedto result in lower growth of (system-wide) money.It's also worth emphasising that the process of money creation is not the result of the actions of anysingle bank – rather, the banking system as a whole acts to create money. A single bank may makeloans by drawing on its liquid assets, yet not receive the corresponding deposits created in return.Before extending further loans, that bank would need to raise funds in other ways – for example, byissuing debt or equity securities or by waiting for its deposits and liquid assets to rise via othermeans.Graph 2 illustrates how the process of money creation can work. It shows an example of an increasein loans of $100 billion. However, the increase in loans in this case leads to an increase in deposits of$60 billion; in other words, the changes are not one for one. This is because there are other sourcesof funding besides deposits – and indeed, loans are not the only assets held by banks. In theexample shown, other funding comes from issuance of debt and equity. The shares from differentsources are in line with the actual funding behaviour of the banking system over recent years(Graph 3). [6]

20/09/2018Money – Born of Credit? | Speeches | RBAhttps://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2018/sp-ag-2018-09-19.html7/16Graph 3In summary, changes in the stock of broad money are the result of a myriad of decisions, includingthose of banks, their borrowers, creditors and shareholders. And these decisions take place withinthe framework of a range of regulatory and institutional arrangements. It is worth noting that theReserve Bank does not target a particular level or growth rate of money (although it has done sounder a previous monetary policy regime). Instead, the Reserve Bank has some influence on themoney stock via the effect of its interest rate target for the overnight cash rate on other interestrates in the economy. These in turn affect the cost of borrowing and economic conditions moregenerally. Ultimately, borrowing and lending decisions – and thus the creation of money – areconstrained by the need for prudent banking behaviour, the budget constraints of borrowers and theprofitability of lenders.One final word on the creation of money is that as fun as it is to teach students about traditionalmoney multipliers, I don't find them to be a very helpful way of thinking about the process. InAustralia, simple regulatory regimes – which had earlier required banks to hold a minimum share oftheir deposits as reserves with the Reserve Bank – have been replaced with modern prudentialregulation and market discipline. Again, the demand for and supply of credit is the real driver ofmoney. That point can be reinforced by examining the behaviour of credit and money over time.What Has Money Been Doing and Why? [7]
20/09/2018Money – Born of Credit? | Speeches | RBAhttps://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2018/sp-ag-2018-09-19.html8/16Given that money is used for transactional purposes and as a store of value, it makes sense thatmost of the time it would at least keep pace with growth in the value of nominal spending. Indeed,in Australia it has grown faster than that over the past 40 years, roughly doubling as a share ofnominal GDP (Graph 4).Growth of credit has been stronger still, roughly tripling as a share of nominal GDP, from under50 per cent in the early 1980s to over 150 per cent currently. A closer look at the banks' balancesheets shows how these changes have occurred.Graph 4In 1980, Australian banks held more than 80 per cent of their liabilities as deposits (worth around$47 billion at the time) (Graph 5). This deposit base was more than sufficient to fund loans of about60 per cent of assets (worth $34 billion). The majority of the remaining assets were held in the formof securities (mostly government bonds). [8]
20/09/2018Money – Born of Credit? | Speeches | RBAhttps://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2018/sp-ag-2018-09-19.html9/16Graph 5As banks grew through the next four decades or so, there was a marked change in the compositionof their balance sheets. These changes reflected choices by both banks and the private sector andwere strongly influenced by the deregulation of the financial system. In particular, constraints onbanks' business activities were progressively removed in the 1970s and early 1980s (for example, theinterest rates they could charge and pay, their product offerings, lending volumes and their assetholdings). This was associated with significant changes in banks' abilities to attract and use differentfunding sources to support balance sheet growth. By the early 1990s, Australians' demand forcredit from banks became larger than the sum of all of their deposits.Following a period of slower growth around the early 1990s recession, credit growth picked up againand continued to grow much more quickly than money. To enable this, a greater proportion of bankfunding during this period was drawn from sources other than deposits. Much of it owed to anincrease in the issuance of debt securities, which was supported, in part, by a strong appetite fromnon-residents for Australian bank debt.These trends continued until the global financial crisis. Following the crisis, credit growth fell for awhile (reflecting a decline in both the supply of and demand for credit). At the same time, the stockof (broad) money increased noticeably, rising by around $1.1 trillion dollars, from around 80 per centof GDP in 2007 to around 115 per cent in 2018. This strong growth reflected a sharp increase in theshare of funding sourced from deposits at the expense of short-term debt securities, consistent with [9]
20/09/2018Money – Born of Credit? | Speeches | RBAhttps://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2018/sp-ag-2018-09-19.html10/16banks seeking more stable funding. Meanwhile, households and businesses increased the share oftheir assets held in the form of deposits.While loans have grown dramatically in nominal terms, to around $2.6 trillion today, the share ofloans on banks' balance sheets is the same as it was in 1980 (Graph 6). In contrast, andnotwithstanding the increase in deposits since the global financial crisis, the share of deposits hasdeclined over the past 40 years from above 80 per cent to around 50 per cent of banks' balancesheets. Currently, a sizeable share of banks' liabilities is in the form of bonds on issue – a sourceof funding that was less important in 1980. Banks also have a much larger share of ‘otherliabilities’ (such as those to non-residents and related parties, which are not included in domesticmonetary aggregates).Graph 6Looking back, it is clear that there have been many instances of sustained gaps between the growthof deposits – and broad money more generally – and the growth of credit (Graph 7). While broadmoney growth outpaced credit growth for most of the period since the financial crisis, this was notthe experience of the two decades or more prior to the crisis, when credit typically outpaced broadmoney.

According to this hypothesis, bankshave been forced to seek other forms of funding, including from short-term money markets, which,so the argument goes, can help to explain the notable rise in rates in those markets in recentmonths.What are we to make of this hypothesis? First, such a gap between the growth of deposits and credithas been commonplace over recent decades – and conditions in short-term money markets werebenign through much of those earlier episodes. Second, loans are not the only assets on banks'balance sheets; indeed, in recent quarters, growth in these other assets has been particularly slow –slower than both credit and deposits (Graph 8). So deposit growth has more than matched thegrowth in total assets. [13]

But retail depositrates have been flat to down over the past year (Graph 9).

More generally, given my earlierdiscussion about the extension of credit leading to the creation of banking system deposits, worryingabout slower deposit growth impinging on the banking system's ability to generate credit is puttingthe cart before the horse.What Can Money or Credit Tell Us about Broader EconomicDevelopments?Given this discussion, it is worth asking whether the behaviour of money can tell us anything usefulabout broader economic developments and, if so, is it more or less useful than the behaviour ofcredit?I'm going to address these questions in a very narrow way by examining whether the growth ofbroad money or credit provides any useful statistical information about the growth of nominal GDP.Because data for money and credit are available about five weeks ahead of the quarterly GDPrelease, we can examine whether growth in the current quarter of these series provides anyadditional information about the likely outcome for nominal GDP this quarter. This exercise isintended to merely determine whether money or credit are useful indicators of GDP. It is not
20/09/2018Money – Born of Credit? | Speeches | RBAhttps://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2018/sp-ag-2018-09-19.html14/16intended to demonstrate whether a causal link exists between money or credit and GDP. (Indeed it ispossible that the direction of causation runs in either or both, directions.)I start with a simple model of quarterly nominal GDP growth as a function of recent lags of nominalGDP growth (Model 1 in Table 2). The model is estimated over the inflation-targeting period. Thissimple model is not particularly useful; lags of nominal GDP growth explain only about 8 per cent ofthe variation in the current growth of nominal GDP. But it gives us a useful baseline for comparison.Table 2: Simple Models of Nominal GDP GrowthMarch quarter 1993 – June quarter 2018 Model 1Model 2Model 3Model 4Constant1.14**0.85**0.88**0.70**GDP growth0.210.04−0.06−0.08Broad money growth0.26*0.16Credit growth0.31**0.25**R-squared0.080.150.170.22Adjusted R-squared0.040.070.090.10(a) Quarterly data; ** indicates statistical significance at the 5 per cent level; * indicates statistical significance at the 10 per centlevel (b) Coefficient presented is the sum of the coefficients on the past four lags of quarterly nominal GDP growth; statisticalsignificance is based on a joint significance test for these coefficients (c) Coefficients presented are the sum of the coefficients onthe current and past four lags of quarterly broad money or credit growth; statistical significance is based on joint significance testsfor these coefficients Sources: ABS, RBAAdding current and past lags of money growth to the baseline model doesn't improve itsperformance much; the sum of the coefficients on the money terms are statistically significant, butonly at a 10 per cent level (Model 2). Similarly, adding current and past lags of credit growthimproves the model's explanatory power only slightly; however, the sum of coefficients on the creditterms are statistically significant at the 5 per cent level (Model 3). Interestingly, if both money andcredit terms are included at the same time, only credit growth is statistically significant (Model 4).This suggests that credit growth is a marginally more useful statistical indicator of the growth ofeconomic activity than money growth; again, I should stress that the contribution of the creditvariable to the model in terms of its additional explanatory power is very modest.ConclusionCurrency in circulation has increased as a share of nominal GDP – indeed it's as high as it's been inmany decades. But the increase in money, which includes bank deposits, has been even greater overthe same period. That increase has been driven by the extension of credit, which depends on thedecisions of borrowers and lenders. Banks have been able to fund that additional credit via growth inother sources of funding, including debt securities and equity. The recognition that deposits arecreated by the banking system via the extension of credit suggests that we should not be concernedabout the banking system facing a deposit funding gap. Moreover, it is consistent with simple(a)(b)(c)(c) [14]

All rights reserved.Survey data indicate that the share of payments made with cash continues to fall. See Flannigan and Staib (2017)for a discussion of the different types of demand for currency. Also, Flannigan and Parsons (2018) provide a cross-country perspective on the increase in the number of high-denomination banknotes in circulation.[4]Doherty et al (forthcoming) contains a highly stylised example that demonstrates how liquidity and capitalconsiderations can affect the decision to extend a loan.[5]In the same way that extending loans can create deposits, repayment of loans can extinguish deposits. Forexample, if the funds credited to the seller's bank account above are used to repay an existing loan, the (system-wide) deposit base will remain as it was prior to this series of transactions. Other transactions of financialintermediaries can also create or extinguish deposits and therefore money. For example, when a bank issues a bondor equity, it receives payment, which is typically from the buyer's deposit account, thereby decreasing the stock ofmoney. The reverse occurs when the principal of the bond is repaid, or in the case of the bank buying back itsequity.[6]Macfarlane (1998) provides a summary of the evolution of the RBA's approach to monetary policy in the last quarterof the twentieth century.[7]Banking regulation from this period required banks to maintain sizeable holdings of certain types of assets. For moreinformation see Battellino and McMillan (1989).[8]See Grenville (1991), Battellino & McMillan (1989) and Battellino (2007) for further details.[9]Note that ‘loans’ on bank balance sheets here is distinct from ‘credit’ in the financial aggregates, which is a slightlybroader measure.[10]Graph 3 shows that banks' deposits are around 60 per cent of funding liabilities, which are a subset of total liabilitieson banks' balance sheets – excluding those not used for funding. There are also some conceptual differences in thedefinition of deposits used.[11]See Black, Kirkwood, Rai and Williams (2012).[12]See RBA (2018), ‘Domestic Financial Conditions’, Statement on Monetary Policy, August, pp 39–50 for a summary ofrecent conditions in short-term money markets and a discussion of factors contributing to elevated short-termmoney market rates.[13]Two caveats regarding the interpretation of these simple modelling results are in order. First, it is possible that thestatistical relationship between credit and GDP growth reflects the effect of some omitted factor — perhaps anindicator of overall financial conditions, such as interest rates for example. Second, this exercise is not intended tocapture a potential role for credit in determining the longer-term economic outlook. For instance, the Council ofFinancial Regulators has identified growing economic risks relating to the high level of indebtedness amongAustralian households. For a recent discussion of these risks, see Bullock (2018). Taking account of suchrelationships is beyond the scope of my simple exercise.[14]

    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 2  2   I am delighted to be here to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Bank of Estonia.  It is a particular privilege to be giving this lecture in the Bank’s “Independence Hall” – the very spot where, on  24 February 1918, Estonia’s Provisional Government was formed.  The founding of the Bank of Estonia followed on the Republic’s first birthday in 1919.  Reaching your first century is a true milestone for any person or institution.  In the UK, when you reach your 100th birthday you receive a signed card of congratulations from the Queen.  I am afraid I have no royal birthday card for you today.  But I have the next best thing – another speech from another central banker.    Times are tough in central banking.  Central banks have borne much of the burden of supporting the global economy as it has recovered from the global financial crisis.  In some advanced economies, such as the UK and US where the output gap has largely been closed, that extraordinary monetary support is now being gradually withdrawn.  In others, such as the euro area, a gradual withdrawal has been clearly signposted.  The gradual withdrawal of exceptional monetary stimulus is unlikely by itself, however, to remove entirely the weight from central banks’ shoulders.  Many have acquired new powers and new responsibilities since the crisis, particularly in the regulatory sphere.  At the same time, the crisis has dented trust in the financial sector, including in central banks.  In combination that has raised expectations, but also some doubts, about the role of central banks in serving society.1  Central banks have, over the course of the recent past, undergone a revolution in their degree of transparency and accountability.  This has delivered huge gains.  By improving public understanding, it has helped stabilise the economy and the financial system.  And by improving public accountability, it has allayed concerns about central banks being over-powerful and under-accountable to the societies they serve.    But time has moved thing on and, as in the past, central banks will need to move with the times.  In response to greater levels of responsibility, but more fragile trust, I will argue a second revolution in central bank practices may be needed.  This would need to be every bit as radical as the first, but would require central banks to engage with, and draw on, the general public – their “folk wisdom” – as never before.    Central banks were put on earth to serve the public.  The second revolution is about putting the public more firmly into public institutions.  At a time of raised expectations and lowered trust, a reinforcement of central banks’ social contract with society could make them even more effective in the period ahead, whether you are the Bank of England (into its fourth century) or the Bank of Estonia (commencing its second).  Let me start by saying a word about the central bank revolution of the recent past, before turning to the present and the future and the challenges and changes that may lie ahead in engaging the general public.  The Bank of England has already begun taking important steps towards increasing its engagement.  Some                                                       1   For example, Tucker (2018).

A Central Bank Revolution  You do not typically associate central banks with revolution, unless the “r” is silent.  Yet I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that, over the course of recent decades, a revolution has swept through pretty much every central bank on the planet.  That revolution has come in the area of external communications, openness and accountability.    It came neither quickly nor easily.  It was only a generation ago that, when asked by Mervyn King for a  one-word piece of advice, Paul Volcker replied “mystique”.  To that point, opacity rather than transparency coursed through central bankers’ veins.  That bloodline ran from Montagu Norman a century ago (“never explain, never apologise”) through to Alan Greenspan a generation ago (“I’ve learned to mumble with great incoherence”).    Historically, the case for central bank secrecy was deeply rooted.  It rested in part on custom and practice, in part on theology.  Central banks historically were rarely subject to external scrutiny, at least by the general public.  And central bankers were generally perceived as the high priests of finance.  It was said that central bankers, like faith, were better understood by their deeds than by their words.2    That was just as well because central bankers rarely uttered any words at all.  A century ago, public utterances by the Governor of the Bank of England amounted to one after-dinner speech each year to a  well-watered set of City of London bankers.  Heroically, attempts were made by some academics to rationalise this monetary mystique as a necessary means of central banks exerting influence over the economy.3     Times have changed.  The central bank secrecy doctrine has been over-turned, in part for conceptual reasons, in part for practical ones.  Within academia, economic theorists began constructing models where policy credibility was absolutely central if people’s expectations were to remain anchored and the economy kept stable.4  Establishing credibility called for clear policy targets and policy actions.  Secrecy about policy actions, whatever its potential shorter-term benefits, came at a potentially significant longer-term cost.  Monetary policy “surprises” might provide a short-term jolt to the economy.  These surprises were especially likely when policy was in the hands of politicians, perhaps seeking re-election.   But these actions nurtured longer-term suspicions that policymakers might neglect inflation, causing inflation expectations to rise and policy credibility to fall.                                                         2  Kynaston (2017) discusses this era of the Bank of England’s history. 3  Brunner (1981). 4  Kydland and Prescott (1977), Barro and Gordon (1983).

They would instead merely stoke expectations of higher inflation.  In the academic jargon, an “inflation bias” would emerge.5   This theoretical story found empirical support in the behaviour of a number of advanced economies during the 1970s, who experienced a so-called “Great Inflation”.6  In part in response to the Great Inflation, a number of central banks began to be given new policy responsibilities to reduce the potential for electorally-driven monetary surprises.  Perhaps the most important of those was operational independence for the setting of monetary policy.  This was an institutional attempt to avoid the temptation to stoke the economy in the short-term, and to anchor inflation expectations in the longer-term, thereby building policy credibility.  With these new policy powers came, reasonably enough, new responsibilities for central banks.  For the first time in their histories, central banks needed to be far more open and transparent about their policy targets and actions.  Why?  Because it was through greater transparency that policy suspicions among the public could be allayed, thereby helping anchor inflation expectations in the economy.    As unelected technocrats acting on society’s behalf, operational independence also called for new means of ensuring central banks were sufficiently accountable to society.  Holding central banks’ feet to the flames called for greater public transparency and greater public scrutiny than ever previously.  Trust in central banks could not be endowed by statute.  It needed instead to be earned through experience and societal scrutiny.  These forces brought about a revolution in central bank practices regarding transparency and accountability.  Over the course of the past century, the number of Bank of England appearances before Parliament has risen around 20-fold;  the number of publications issued has risen around 600-fold;  and the number of words uttered has risen around 1,000-fold.  You don’t need Tracy Chapman to tell you I’m talkin’ ‘bout a revolution.  Elsewhere around the world, the pattern has been much the same.  We have seen a rising tide of speeches, publications and parliamentary appearances by central banks.  The Bank of Estonia has been at or close to the frontier of this revolution.  Today it provides a rich daily diet of reports, forecasts, working papers, speeches and tweets.  The 20th century may yet be seen by historians as a Golden Age for central banks.  Central bank numbers rose from under 20 at the start of the century to over 175 by its close.  Those with operational independence for monetary policy rose from fewer than 40 in 1971 to over 150 today.   And the numbers of central banks with responsibilities for regulatory policy has risen sharply too, especially since the crisis.7                                                          5  Barro and Gordon (1983). 6  For example, Nelson (2005). 7  Haldane (2017a). 
    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 5  5   The rise in central bank numbers in part reflects the greater numbers of nation states in the 20th century.  But this, too, is revealing.  Establishing a central bank has increasingly been seen as an essential building block of nation state-building, a crucial element in the fabric of democratic statecraft.  Indeed, that was precisely the Estonian experience, as events in this very room a century ago testify.    The Age of Innocence   This Golden Age of central banking has persisted for a century.  As best we can tell, it has served economies and societies well.  Prior to the crisis, the global economy entered a golden period of its own with steady growth and stable inflation, known as the “Great Moderation”.8  Mervyn King, Bank of England Governor at the time, gave this period a different name –  the NICE (Non-inflationary consistently-expansionary) decade.9  It is not difficult to see why.  Growth in advanced economies averaged 2.5% and inflation 2.2%.  The volatility of inflation was around 80% lower, and the volatility of output 5% lower, than in the preceding two decades (Chart 1).  With the economy performing NICE-ly, public trust in central banks was running high.  Approval ratings for the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank and Bank of England were all at healthy levels.   The global financial crisis has ushered in a new era.  Great Moderation gave way first to a Great Recession and then a Grudging Recovery.  Advanced economy growth over the past decade has averaged only 1.5%.  The volatility of inflation has risen by 40%, and the volatility of output growth by 60%, relative to the pre-crisis decade (Chart 1).  The NICE decade has given way to a VILE (Volatile-Inflation Less-Expansionary) one.10    It should perhaps come as no surprise that one of the casualties of the crisis has been levels of public trust in the financial system, banks and central banks.  Measures of satisfaction or confidence in central banks fell in the UK, US and euro area at the time of the global financial crisis.11  They have yet fully to recover and may reflect diminished trust.  The situation in Japan is similar, except their crisis came sooner and the bust in trust has lasted longer.  Explaining this increasingly fragile trust in central banks is, in part, a story of the crisis.  Pre-crisis, central banks were seen as stewards of the financial system.  A failure of that system inevitably then caused some questioning of central banks’ stewardship role.  The financial crisis was the catalyst for some loss of faith in the stewards in much the same way the expenses scandal was for British political stewards a few years ago.  But there are also deeper-seated changes underway in the nature of the public’s trust, not specific to central banks, what Rachel Botsman calls the “Trust Shift”.12  Once upon a time, public trust was endowed on public institutions rather than needing to be earned.  Trust was anonymous and centralised.  The public did not ask                                                       8  Stock and Watson (2003). 9  King (2003). 10  “VILE” was coined by my MPC colleague Michael Saunders (see, for example, Giles and Atkins (2008)). 11  Haldane (2017a). 12  Botsman (2017). 
    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 6  6   difficult questions and public institutions, by and large, did not feel the need to provide answers.  For public institutions, this was the Age of Innocence.    As centralised and largely anonymous institutions, central banks surfed on this wave of blind trust during their early years.  During the Age of Innocence, there was no public expectation of openness or accountability or need to build bridges with the public or parliaments.  When quizzed for an explanation by a Parliamentary Committee in 1930, Montagu Norman replied:  “I don’t have reasons, I have instincts”.    But the public’s attitudes towards trust have altered and so too has the trust-building process.  Faith in public institutions is no longer blind.  Trust is no longer endowed anonymously.  Instead it is built through direct connections, often personalised and localised.  Trust is no longer centralised in institutions.  Instead it is built on a distributed basis, peer-by-peer, across the network.  In short, the Age of Innocence is over.    As the public’s trust has shape-shifted, central banks and other public institutions have faced new challenges to their trust.  Indeed, this helps explain the first revolution in central bank transparency practices.  But the crisis has added cyclical push to this structural fall in trust.  Central banks are no longer surfing a wave.  They face instead a retreating tide.  For them, too, the Age of Innocence may be over.    While some loss of trust in central banks might have been expected, it is disappointing that the pre-crisis revolution in transparency practices did not provide a greater degree of insulation against it.  Why was central banks’ stock of reputational capital, built steadily through various transparency initiatives, inadequate to protect them from the crisis storm?  I think there were two factors at play.    First, central banks have tools, such as interest rates and banking regulations, which support the whole of the economy and financial system.  They affect people’s lives greatly, supporting jobs and incomes, a stable cost of living, an adequate supply of credit, confidence in money.  But the impact of central banks’ tools is often indirect and lagged;  it is difficult for people to observe these benefits in their everyday lives.    When people get a job or a pay rise or a loan, they tend to attribute this to their own good luck or good management.  Rarely do they link it to actions taken by central banks, months or perhaps years earlier.  The benefits of central bank actions are, for most people, articles of faith rather than fact.  These days, with trust needing to be earned, this puts central banks at a natural disadvantage.    We see this pattern in other professions.  In surveys, the general public are typically mistrustful of politicians and bankers, who appear close to bottom of their trust league table.  Yet their trust scores for local MPs and local bank branch managers have remained high because of their closer connection with people’s lives.  Central banks, operating economy-wide, perhaps face some of the same challenges as bankers and politicians.

Once public trust is lost, public understanding becomes crucial to restore it.  The hope was that the revolution in central bank transparency initiatives had provided that improved public understanding of the economy and central banks.  In practice, the evidence suggests progress towards improving the public’s understanding of the economy, finance and central banks has been slow and patchy, despite these initiatives.  To start with the positives, there is concrete evidence of the improved central bank communications having improved the functioning of financial markets, the forecasting performance of economists and even the reporting of the media on the economy.13  The transparency revolution improved understanding among those whose day job it was to understand the economy and the role of central banks within it – the experts.  The revolution appears to have had far less impact on understanding among the public – the non-experts.  In 1999, the Bank of England began surveying the public to gauge their understanding of the economy and the Bank.14  Back then, only around 7% identified the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) as responsible for setting interest rates.  19 years and one transparency revolution later, the same survey earlier this year suggested around 6% of the general public had heard of the MPC.15    The failure to boost understanding of the economy and central banks among the general public helps explain why trust in central banks proved more fragile than expected after the crisis.  It is for these reasons I have spoken about central banks facing a “twin deficits” problem – a deficit of public understanding and a deficit of public trust.16  These twin deficits are clearly complementary and mutually-reinforcing.    These twin deficits have not, so far at least, had especially serious consequences for central banks.  There has been no de-anchoring of inflation expectations.  There has been no rolling-back of central bank responsibilities nor systematic retreat from central bank operational independence on monetary and regulatory matters.  If anything, central banks’ sets of responsibilities have recently been added to.  At the same time, more questions are probably being asked about the role and powers of central bank than at any time in a generation.  That is in part a reflection of the increased responsibilities central banks have been handed;  in part a reflection of the higher expectations being placed on central banks’ actions;  and in part a reflection of the dent in trust in institutions the crisis has delivered.  This is a triple challenge.  A year ago, the Bank of England hosted a conference to mark 20 years since it was granted operational independence for monetary policy.  At that event, I was struck by the number of speakers calling time on the                                                       13  For example, Gürkaynak, Sack and Swanson (2005), Gürkaynak, Levin and Swanson (2010), Berger, Ehrmann, and Fratzscher (2011). 14  Bank of England Inflation Attitudes Survey, currently run jointly with TNS. 15  The same survey also gives the “Bank of England” as option to the question of which group sets interest rates.  More respondents identify the Bank of England as being responsible for setting interest rates (around 30%) than the Monetary Policy Committee, but this too has been broadly flat over time. 16  Haldane (2017b).

Some asked openly whether central bank independence was appropriate, at least on financial stability matters.  I am not as pessimistic or as fatalistic as that.  But I do think some of those concerns about understanding, trust and legitimacy are real.  In response to them, new efforts may be needed to close the understanding and trust deficits and bridge the transparency and accountability gaps.  Doing so would, I believe, leave central banks even better-informed and better-placed to deliver their core mandates in future.  Here is why.   Correcting the Deficits  My answer comes in two, inter-related, parts.  Let me take these in turn.  First, building understanding among the general public in the economy, financial system and central banks.    Most people would think an improved understanding of the economy among the general public is desirable.  It makes for improved decision-making by people on important everyday decisions on spending, saving, borrowing and working.  The better those individual decisions (the micro), the more stable the economy and financial system are likely to be (the macro).  Improved public understanding of the economy is in that sense win-win, benefitting policymakers and the public alike.    But it is possible the benefits of improved public understanding in stabilising the economy and financial system have been underestimated.  “Popular narratives” among the public might be more important in driving macro-economic behaviour than in the past.  And these narratives may be more prone to destabilisation than in the past.  If so, too little may have been invested historically, by both the public and policymakers, in informing these narratives and hence stabilising the economy.   Public understanding of the economy and finance starts from a low base.  You do not have to take my word for it.  That is the strongly-held view of the public themselves.  In surveys, almost half of the public say they believe they lack an adequate understanding of economic and financial issues when making crucial everyday decisions.17  This is a weak endowment.  We now know quite a bit about the costs to individuals of this weak endowment, which appear to be large and long-lasting.  For example, poor levels of financial education have been shown to have large and lasting effects on individuals’ health – financial, physical and mental.18  Financial illiteracy is a recipe for debt, default and depression, whose effects appear to feedback on each another in a vicious spiral.                                                        17  FCA (2017). 18  Richardson et al (2017), Earwicker (2016).  
    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 9  9   These individual costs are amplified when they are aggregated up to the macro level.  How people’s expectations evolve – their degree of optimism or pessimism, exuberance or depression – is crucial for determining their individual decisions.  It has long been recognised that these expectations can be shaped importantly by others’ expectations.  For example, “popular narratives” can emerge which shape collective expectations among the public – optimism or pessimism, exuberance or depression – and which can then drive aggregate economic fluctuations.19  Recent research has demonstrated just how powerful those emergent popular narratives can be, economically and financially.  As one example, the work of Nick Bloom and co-authors has constructed various measures of businesses’ degree of uncertainty around key issues, based on the words used in media reporting.20  These narrative-based measures of uncertainty have been found to be important for explaining the investment behaviour of companies over time.    David Tuckett and co-authors have constructed measures of the popular narratives used by participants in financial markets.21  They find that these narratives can play an important role in explaining asset price dynamics, over and above the impact of macro-economic fundamentals.  In a similar spirit, the work of Michael Bailey and co-authors has found, using Facebook data, an important role for shared social narratives in explaining behaviour in the housing market.22     At a macroeconomic level, the work of George Akerlof and Robert Shiller has looked at the popular narratives which emerge during periods of boom and bust.23  Using words extracted from newspapers, they find the prevailing popular narratives about the economy have played a significant role in accounting for the heights of the peaks and depths of the troughs during macro-economic booms and busts.  Public expectations, embedded in the stories they tell, are a key macro-economic driver.    The common theme in all of this research is the importance of the public’s “narratives” in shaping their behaviour.  That is true individually but especially collectively – hence “popular narratives” – with shifts in collective expectations helping account for the width and depth of macro-economic fluctuations.  As well as contributing to this research, the Bank has begun using these “narrative” approaches itself to help understand behaviour.  Let me give you a topical example.  The Bank’s Agents around the UK have a wide network of company contacts who they visit regularly to discuss the economy.  These visits are then written up.  These write-ups enable a semantic search to be carried out to identify the key themes or narratives emerging in companies’ conversations.  You will be unsurprised to hear that a key theme among companies over recent quarters has been uncertainty surrounding Brexit.                                                       19  Shiller (2017). 20  Baker, Bloom and Davis (2016), Bloom (2009) and Bloom, Bond and Van Reenen (2007). 21  For example, Tuckett (2011) and Tuckett and Nikolic (2017). 22  Bailey et al (2016). 23  Akerlof and Shiller (2009) and Shiller (2017). 
    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 10  10    Figure 1 plots a word cloud extracted from those company write-ups.  The size of each word connotes the frequency of its use in relation to mentions of “uncertainty”.  For a word that did not exist as recently as five years ago, it is striking how Brexit is now dominating companies’ conversations.  Currently, it crops up 10 times more often than the word “customer” and almost 7 times more often than the word “staff” in proximity to uncertainty.24  Chart 2 plots a time-series of the incidence of the words “uncertainty” and “Brexit/referendum” in Agents’ company write-ups.  The two, unsurprisingly, are positively correlated after the referendum.  Indeed, mentions of Brexit have outnumbered mentions of uncertainty by a factor of around 3 since the referendum.  While mentions of Brexit have fallen from their referendum peak, it is notable that they have picked up sharply over the past few months, with measures of uncertainty following suit.     This new research strengthens the case for improving public understanding of the economy.  An improved understanding could result in better-informed popular narratives, and more stable expectations, among the general.  And that, ultimately, would make for a more stable economy and financial system.    In practice, there may be structural factors which could be acting in the opposite direction.  The great trust shift may mean people are less willing than in the past to trust expert opinion (such as through mainstream media) and more willing to trust non-expert opinion (such as some parts of social media).  Around half of those in the EU use social media as a news source and, among those aged 18-24 in the UK, around a quarter use it as their main news source.25  Yet we know that information from social media sources is typically filtered and personalised.26  That fits people’s (personalised, localised) preferences. But it also results in news narratives which are more likely to be self-reinforcing and self-referential than in the past.  The echoes in this chamber are louder, reach further, last longer.  They are also less likely to be balanced and objective.  More powerful, but less balanced, popular narratives are a potentially destabilising influence on expectations and the economy.       This research points in one direction.  The case for improved public understanding of the economy and financial system has always been strong.  But in a world where popular narratives are even more important in driving economic behaviour, and where these narratives may be even more susceptible to destabilisation, the case for improving public understanding is significantly reinforced.  This is one blade of the scissors of public engagement.                                                         24  This analysis uses company visit write-ups produced by the Bank’s Agents themselves, rather than contacts so is of course only a proxy for the latter’s views. 25  Newman et al (2016). 26  For example, Papacharissi (2002). 
    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 11  11   The second blade is building central banks’ understanding of the economy and financial system through the general public.  This is newer, but I believe fertile, ground for central banks.  Central banks pride themselves, rightly, on their technocratic skills and economic expertise.  There are limits to that knowledge, as there are to knowledge in every domain and discipline.  Those limits and uncertainties need importantly to be recognised when understanding the economy and when setting policy.    Nonetheless, it would be a false step to dispense with that expertise.  No one seriously questions the need for heart surgeons or car mechanics, the need for specialist knowledge and experienced decision-making when repairing hearts or car parts.  Human bodies and car engines are complex environments.  But so too is the economic and financial system.  It too needs specialist knowledge and experienced decision-makers.  It does not follow from this, however, that expertise cannot be augmented or improved on by drawing on as wide a set of opinions as possible, expert and non-expert.  Non-experts can provide a different lens on problems and solutions.  This diversity of thought has been found to be especially useful in complex decision environments.  Colloquially, that is why we call it “folk wisdom”.  Back in 2004, James Surowiecki gave it another name – the “wisdom of crowds”.27  There are now many examples of collective wisdom at work.    The most celebrated is 19th century English statistician Francis Galton’s amazement at the accuracy of the average guesses about the weight of an ox among visitors to a county fair.  Less celebrated (though, as it turns out, more accurate) was English magician Derren Brown’s attempt to predict the UK National Lottery results in 2009 using the wisdom of crowds.  The wisdom of crowds is not magic.  Subsequent research has found that it relies instead on two factors:  diversity and deliberation.    To take these in turn, the value of diversity in complex decision-making is fairly well-understood.  Diversity of thought simultaneously increases the chances of creative solutions being found, while reducing the chances of terrible solutions being adopted.  It fattens the upper tail, and thins the lower tail, of the insight distribution.  Diversity delivers higher return for lower risk.28  These benefits arise, in part, from having a wider pool of ideas in which to fish and a deeper pool in which to dilute risks.  But they also arise from the collective benefits of having these new ideas and risks challenged and filtered by a group.  The benefits of diversity arise as much from interactions within the group, as from the new ideas each person brings.  But both are important for good ideas to emerge and for bad ideas to submerge.  And it is this which fattens returns and slims risks, whatever the decision.                                                        27  Surowiecki (2004). 28  Haldane (2016). 
    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 12  12   These benefits have been demonstrated in a number of real-world settings.  In his book The Difference, Scott Page goes a step further with a “Diversity Trumps Ability” theorem.29  This states that the  highest-performing team is very unlikely to arise from bringing together the individually-best experts.   Instead it comes from combining insights from diverse sources, expert and non-expert.  It comes from a cocktail of experience, some specialist, some generalist.  The returns to diversity are not limitless.  When choosing the optimal asset portfolio, most of the benefits of diversification come from the first few assets.  The same is true when the assets are people.  The diversity benefits in moving from 2 to 4 people are large compared with the diversity benefits of going from 102 to 104 people.  There are probably diminishing returns to diversity.  The second factor important for the wisdom of crowds is deliberation. Complex decisions require an investment of time, a period of deliberation.  This is needed to understand a complex problem, consider it from different angles, to test it with different solutions.  Solving complex problems does not in general call for instinctive, “fast thinking” of the type described by Daniel Kahneman in his famous book, Thinking Fast and Slow.30  It instead calls for “slow thinking”, for System 2 rather than System 1 thinking.  Time is also important when harvesting the benefits of interactions within a diverse group.  It takes time for groups to explore and test their ideas, winnowing out the winners and filtering out the losers.  It takes time for people to change their minds.  As with diversity, there are decreasing returns to deliberation time.  Research suggests that spending as little as 1 hour on a complex problem can improve performance by 10%.31  These benefits are likely to be smaller when moving from 100 to 101 hours spent on the same problem.   While diversity and deliberation are the cornerstones of the wisdom of crowds, it is clear that crowds are not always and everywhere wise.  I am rarely much the wiser about the parentage of a football referee for having listened to the collective chants of the crowd.  This observation is not a new one;  it has a long historical pedigree.  In 1841, Charles Mackay published a now-famous book whose title stands in stark contrast to Surowiecki’s – Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds.32    Many subsequent authors have provided examples of collective irrationality in crowd decision-making.  Its causes have also been extensively studied by psychologists, sociologists and economists.33  This originates in the contagious spread of opinion through networks.  The larger and more connected the network, and the less well-informed its participants, the greater the chances of irrational epidemics spreading.  The behaviour underpinning this group psychology is as old as humankind.  The desire to conform to group type has its roots in our hunter-gatherer past.  It has been found, time and again, in studies of human                                                       29  Page (2008) and Hong and Page (2004). 30  Kahneman (2012). 31  Tetlock and Gardner (2015). 32  Mackay (1841). 33  For example, Janis (1972), Turner and Pratkanis (1998)

More recently, these psychological roots may have been fed and watered by technological advances, such as social media.  This has increased our digital connectivity.  For reasons set out earlier, it has probably also increased the chances of self-reinforcing and self-referential waves of collective irrationality taking hold.35  If so, these waves of collective irrationality could be becoming larger than ever.  While a vestige of our  hunter-gatherer past, the madness of crowds can these days spread to a global village.  That leaves us with a conundrum.  If decision-makers in complex environments were to draw on a wider set of non-expert opinion, what are they likely to encounter?  Is it a case of harnessing the wisdom of crowds or avoiding their madness?  Will greater public engagement help inform and improve expert decision-making by widening the pool of lived experience?  Or will it hinder that decision-making by polluting the information pool with irrational or irrelevant opinions?  Perhaps the most comprehensive study of the value of expert and non-expert opinion, as it applies to complex decision-making in the social sciences, has been provided by political scientist Philip Tetlock.   Over a more than 20-year period, he has researched forecast accuracy and, most recently, run The Good Judgement Project.  This explored the performance of a set of experts and non-experts in forecasting the outcome of a particularly complex set of decision problems.      So what does Tetlock’s evidence suggest?  That the usefulness of non-expert opinion in complex decision settings depends on how exactly this information is drawn in and drawn on.  From Tetlock’s book with  Dan Gardner in 2015, Super-forecasting, I would highlight two key findings.  These chime with the evidence outlined earlier on the costs and benefits of expert and non-expert opinion in collective decision-making.  First, there is real value in non-expert opinion when it comes to complex forecasting tasks.  In a famous example, Tetlock convened a group of 1,000 amateur forecasters and entered them in a prestigious forecasting tournament run by the US intelligence agencies (IARPA).36  This team beat the control group by 60% in year 1 and 78% in year 2.  It not only beat expert academics from MIT to Colombia, but professionals from the US intelligence services with access to classified information.  This is what Tetlock calls Super-forecasting.  The incremental value of non-expert judgements has been shown in a wide array of settings and for a wide range of complex problems.  What about judgments on the complex dynamics of the economic and financial system?  While we do not have a structured experiment on which to draw, we do have illustrative evidence on the relative forecasting performance of different groups.                                                        34  For example, Roubini and Mihm (2011) and Janis (1972). 35  Shafik (2017) discusses the impact of the rise of social media. 36  Tetlock and Gardner (2015).

For each group we consider their forecasts for UK inflation 1, 2 and 3 years ahead.  The sample period is relatively short so our conclusions need to be cautious.  And forecast accuracy is not the same as policy acumen.  Nonetheless, Chart 3 suggests that, in a complex forecasting task, there is little to choose between experts and  non-experts.37  Tetlock’s second key point, which qualifies his first, is that not everyone can be a super-forecaster.  A randomly-chosen panel of non-experts cannot by itself be expected to outperform the experts.  Chart 3 demonstrates that.  Super-forecasting is not simply a law of large numbers.  Tetlock shows that non-expert super-forecasters have particular characteristics, including inquisitiveness and independence of mind.  Only those with these characteristics consistently outperform the experts.  We do not have a clean test of this hypothesis for our inflation forecasts.  But just imagine the Bank had been able to identify in advance one “super-forecaster” among the pool of outside forecasters.  How much would that have improved its forecasts over the sample period?  The gap in two year-ahead forecast errors between the MPC and the best external forecaster in the panel of outside forecasters is around ¼ percentage point.  20/20 hindsight is a wonderful thing, but this gives some measure of the scope for forecast improvement.38   If we take Tetlock’s points together, they suggest that there is real value in seeking the views of non-experts to help inform difficult decisions.  But there are limits to these benefits.  It is unrealistic to expect everyone to become a super-forecaster.  For central banks the message is that, by widening their information net, they could stand to benefit from the wisdom of crowds.  But there are limits to how and to how far you would wish to widen the net if the crowd is to add signal rather than noise.  To illustrate this point, consider the following thought-experiment.  Imagine you have an endowment of  time – 10,000 hours – to make as informed a decision as possible on a complex question.  I have not chosen 10,000 hours randomly.  In his book Outliers, Malcolm Gladwell argues, based on a detailed set of case studies, that it takes around 10,000 hours for one person to command true expertise in a subject area.    Now let’s choose a complex, and topical, question:  will Artificial Intelligence (AI) cause mass unemployment?  It is well-known that the views of experts (and non-experts) differ widely on this complex question and that the outcome is very uncertain.  The problem we need to solve is not this but a simpler one:  how many people should we choose to help inform our view on the impact of AI on unemployment?                                                        37  The conditioning assumptions (such as the assumed path of interest rates) and purpose of forecasts will vary between central banks and other forecasters. 38  Mankodi and Pike (2018) discuss whether central bankers can become superforecasters. 
    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 15  15   One possible answer to this question is one person.  With Gladwell’s 10,000 hours under their belt, this person would be as well-informed on the impact of AI on unemployment as anyone on the planet – a true expert, perhaps even a phenomenon.  This is the single person or, if you like, Oracle (in the Ancient Greek sense of the word) solution to this decision problem.  But is it the optimal one?  There are reasons for doubt.  Evidence clearly suggests that, in a complex decision environment, drawing on non-expert opinion can provide added insight.  It offers diversity of perspective, whose benefits are amplified if those diverse perspectives are discussed and debated to arrive at collective conclusions.  This is Surowiecki’s “wisdom of crowds” at work.  So let’s go to the other end of the spectrum and draw instead on the insights of a big crowd – say, 1 million people, roughly the adult population of Estonia.  This would then, in effect, be an Estonian referendum on  AI and unemployment.  Clearly, we would now be drawing on a vast array of expert and non-expert opinion.  But that would come at the expense of less time for deliberation.  Given our time quota, each person would now have only around 30 seconds to give an answer.  Facing a tight time constraint and a very complex question, most people would struggle.  I certainly would.  The best a non-expert could probably do is to provide an instinctive, “fast thinking” response.  Or, perhaps more likely still, they might jump aboard a collective, but potentially poorly-informed, bandwagon by copying what others say.  This would increase greatly the chances of Mackay’s “madness of crowds”.  Finally, let’s try an interior solution – say 1,000 people each spending 10 hours.  This is large enough a number to gather most of the benefits of diversity, but small enough to harvest the benefits of deliberation.  It would blend expert and non-expert opinion in a way which would allow collective deliberation.  This is the “wisdom of crowds” solution.      Figure 2 plots the relationship between insight and the numbers of people providing information in a group, in stylised terms.  You might call it the “Insight Curve”.  The curve (shown in dotted lines) results from combining the effects of a downward-sloping “deliberation” curve and an upward-sloping “diversity” curve.  Consistent with the evidence, both exhibit diminishing returns.  The inverted U-shaped “Insight Curve” identifies the optimal number of people to draw on to inform a complex decision.  The two corner solutions – the “Oracle” (single person) and the “Madness of Crowds” (population) – involve very different trade-offs between diversity and deliberation.  A single source of information gives you plenty of time for deliberation – a hermit-like 10,000 hours.  But it leaves you short of diversity of thought.  A population-wide pool of information gives us as much diversity as you could ever wish.  But it leaves you long fast-thinkers, short slow-thinkers and vulnerable to irrationality.  
    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 16  16   Both are inferior to an intermediate solution – the “Wisdom of Crowds” solution.  This involves combining the insights from both experts and non-experts, to reap the benefits of diversity of thought and action.  But this larger pool is not so large as to dilute the time available for slow-thinking and deliberation.  It is a cocktail of expert and non-expert opinion, comprising diversity and deliberation in equal measure, that cause good ideas to flourish and bad ones to perish.  A relevant, practical question is where the optimal point along the insight curve lies.  What is the optimal number of people from whom to seek views if we are to maximise the benefits of folk wisdom?  My stylised example cannot provide an answer to that question.  But some studies have looked at this question using experimental methods and, reach interesting conclusions.    Christian Wagner and Tom Vinaimont ask two questions.39  First, how large does a group of non-experts need to be to exhibit expert-like performance?  Second, how large does this group need to be to outperform consistently a group of experts?  On the assumption experts’ views are ten times more precise than a  non-expert, their answer to the first question is around 30 and the second around 1,000.  This bookends the range of non-expert views we might need in seeking the “wisdom of crowds”.     Representative Decision-Making  If we take this analysis at face value, the question is how practically central banks can engage a wider,  non-expert, audience to help inform their views on the economy and financial system?  What new infrastructure or architecture is needed for collecting and assimilating these views?  And how do we ensure they balance diversity and deliberation so as to be representative of the general public’s views?  These are deep questions, but they are not new ones.  They have been debated by philosophers and political scientists for thousands of years.  Alternative models of representative decision-making have been tried and tested throughout the course of history.  This experience contains some useful lessons for central banks, and other public institutions, seeking to strengthen the infrastructure linking them to wider society.    Let’s start at the very beginning.  The birthplace of democracy is, for many, ancient Greece.  Around 2,500 years ago, the city-state of Athens pioneered a particular form of representative decision-making when it came to judgements on some of the most complex, societally-significant, issues of the day.  The centrepiece of this decision-making infrastructure was a public body – a Council of Five Hundred, or boule.    The boule comprised individuals drawn from the general public by random selection (or sortition).  They served for a year.  The purpose of the boule was to debate key issues affecting public life and devise policy proposals.  These were then taken to a public assembly for discussion, where a wider set of the general                                                       39  Wagner and Vinaimont (2010). 
    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 17  17   public participated, often running into the thousands.  For a small number of positions requiring specialist skills, public officials and experts were elected or appointed.       The Athenian boule was not democratic embroidery, like a modern-day focus group.  It had real power.  It decided which proposals were taken to the public assembly and which were lawful.  Brett Hennig calls it the “nerve centre of power” in ancient Athens.40  The boule had wide public acceptance and attendance. Participation in public life, through the boule or public assembly, was an accepted part of Athenians’ civic responsibilities.  Those not taking part were termed idiotes, from which the modern word idiot derives.    The infrastructure was far from perfect;  the boule excluded women, slaves and non-citizens.  But it was notable in seeking to strike a balance between the two features subsequent research has shown to be crucial for effective, representative decision-making in complex environments:  diversity and deliberation.  Indeed, for that reason some have called the Athenian model of decision-making a deliberative democracy.41  Diversity of decision-making was achieved by calling on a rotating, randomly-selected pool of non-expert citizens, augmented by experts in a limited number of positions.  Deliberation in decision-making was achieved by restricting the number of representatives, having them convene and discuss regularly and agree on a set of proposals.  The Council of Five Hundred sits slap bang in the middle of the optimal range of people suggested by Wagner and Vinaimont.  The Greek Empire of course did not last.  Nor did its model of deliberative democracy for decision-making.  In the period since, two alternative models of representative decision-making have risen to prominence.  Interestingly, these seek to strike a rather different balance between diversity and deliberation, both relative to the Athenian model and especially relative to each other.  One is executive democracy.  Under this model, an elected or appointed set of representatives take decisions on society’s behalf, often through a Parliament or Congress.  This model underpins modern democracies in a great many countries;  it has grown in popularity for much of the past 200 years.  Such has been its success, many people these days would define democracy in terms of this model.  For most of history, this was not the case.  Aristotle was not alone in seeing an executive democratic model as an “elected oligarchy”.42  At the time many executive democracies were being put in place, their Founding Fathers (they were all still men) were often deeply suspicious of Athenian-style democracy.  John Adams, second President of the United States, captured it thus:  “Remember democracy never lasts long.  It soon wastes, exhausts and murders itself”.43  The Greek Empire lasted only 350 years before exhausting itself.                                                         40  Hennig (2017), Van Reybrouck (2016). 41  Gruen (2018), Fiskhin et al (2008). 42  Politics, Aristotle. 43  From John Adams to John Taylor, 17 December 1814. 
    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 18  18   While Adams was wrong about the durability of executive democracy, suspicions about whether it properly represents all slices of society have persisted.  Indeed, these suspicions have risen recently.  At the same time as the steady ascent in the numbers of countries adopting the executive democratic model, there has been a steady descent in public trust in the representatives of executive democratic institutions.  At the heart of those trust problems are concerns about whether decision-making is sufficiently reflective of wider society.  By and large, the public accept that the executive democratic model is a reasonable vehicle for discussion and deliberation in decision-making.  Indeed, the public can watch those deliberations on TV.  But there is a concern among the public about whether decision-making and decision-makers are sufficiently diverse, whether they properly reflect and represent societies’ views and needs.   This is not an accusation that could be levelled at the alternative model of representative decision-making – so-called direct democracy.  This puts voice and vote firmly in the hands of public on decisions with an important bearing on wider society.  This model has been used to varying degrees across various countries at various times.  In some countries, public referenda are reserved for decisions whose societal impact is especially large and long-lasting.  I am sure we can all think of examples.    This model is recognised as having both pros and cons.  It draws in a much wider range of expert and  non-expert opinion, so achieves a potentially greater degree of representativeness and diversity than alternatives.  This very breadth, however, makes it difficult to have a deliberative dialogue in which participants have the time to consider carefully the facts, competing hypotheses and possible solutions.  This risks the collective view being less well-informed, and potentially more polarised, than would be ideal.       With degrees of discontent about both the executive and direct democratic models, there has recently been a rekindling of interest in the Athenian, or deliberative democracy, model.  This model, at least in principle, offers greater diversity than the executive democratic model.  It also offers greater scope for debate and deliberation than the direct democratic model.  It is not a third way, as it was in fact the first.  But it is a middle way.  It is in some ways the institutional incarnation of the “Insight Curve”.  Interestingly, a number of countries have over recent years begun experimenting with deliberative democratic processes to debate and resolve some of societies’ most complex problems.  Citizens’ panels or juries have been used to tackle such varied issues as voting reform (in Canada), gay rights (Ireland), reconciliation between indigenous and non-indigenous communities (Australia), nuclear power (South Korea), membership of the euro (Denmark) and environmental pollution (United States).44    Here in Estonia, you have experience of using people’s assemblies to debate key societal issues.  In 2013, a people’s assembly (Rahvakogu) was used to debate Estonian electoral laws.  Last year, a people’s assembly was used to deliberate on the future of ageing and pension reform.  People’s juries have also been                                                       44  See https://cdd.stanford.edu/deliberative-polling-timeline/ 
    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 19  19   used to debate regional issues, including water transportation in the Emajõgi River region of the country.  Estonia has been a relative hotbed of activity on deliberative decision-making in practice.  Each of these experiments used slightly differently approaches.  This has provided useful case law on which to decide what works and when.  One interesting finding is that citizens’ panels can be effective not just in getting people to engage on issues of national or regional importance, but in providing an effective forum for people to change their minds, and converge in their opinions, on these issues.  They can reduce polarisation.  These benefits lie at the heart of the deliberative democratic process.  A second lesson is that technology is a potential game-changer for deliberative decision-making.  This relies on a distributed, modular structure.  Historically, structures such as the size of the boule placed physical constraints on the scope for information-making and debate.  Digital structures loosen those constraints, allowing longer reach and greater connectivity at greater speed.  Some countries have begun using digital technologies to support their deliberative processes, including here in Estonia.    The benefits of doing so are partly practical, with greater numbers of people able to connect and communicate than ever previously.  The public assemblies of Ancient Greece brought together people in their thousands.  Today, technology could do so for millions of people.  There are also, however, behavioural benefits.  The “trust shift” among the public means credibility and understanding is more often these days built through distributed means and direct connections.  A digital infrastructure can help those ends meet.  It could be argued that these country-level experiments are just that – experiments.  The deliberative model has not been tried and tested in anger for the full gamut of societal decisions.  As put, that is true.  Yet there is at least one domain of public policy where this model has been tried and tested (both literally and metaphorically) for a wide range of societal decisions over many centuries:  the judicial system.    Many judicial systems draw on both expert (judges) and non-expert (juries) opinion, like the Athenians.   Non-experts are drawn randomly from the population, as in Athens.  There is a clear process for deliberation among participants, as in the boule.  This system is the nerve-centre of decision-making on a defined set of issues, as in Ancient Greece.  The English judicial system has already lasted for almost 1,000 years, more than twice as long as the Greek Empire.  The Next Revolution  Against this backdrop, what concrete steps might central banks take to build an improved infrastructure for engagement with the general public?  Can it build on others’ experience in engaging wider society, in ways which improve the public’s and policymakers’ understanding of the economy?  Let me offer some suggestions, which are motivated by recent initiatives at the Bank of England aimed at doing just that.   
    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 20  20   (a) Minding Your Language  Historically, the language of central banks has often been pitched at a level which has made it difficult for most non-experts to understand.  This has contributed to the public’s understanding and trust deficits.  Slowly but surely, that is beginning to change.  Central bank’s external communications are being reoriented towards a wider, non-specialist audience.  Let me give a couple of examples.  The first is so-called “forward guidance” about monetary policy.45  How you judge its success hinges crucially on what you consider to have been its objective and audience.  If you are a financial market participant whose job it is to price the future path of interest rates, the most useful type of policy guidance is precise and time-specific.  By contrast, if you are a company or household considering whether to spend, a general idea of the direction and destination of interest rates is likely to be sufficient.  The critics of forward guidance have tended to be financial market participants for whom it lacks sufficient precision and time-specificity.  But forward guidance simply cannot be that precise;  it depends on the path of the economy.  And pricing interest rates in financial markets was not the main purpose of forward guidance in the first place.  Its purpose was to support spending in the economy by households and companies. That calls for shorter and simpler guidance, focussed on the broad direction and destination of interest rates.  The MPC first used the words “limited and gradual” in 2014 when describing the likely future course of interest rates rises.  It was short and simple – three little words.  It was guidance aimed squarely at households and companies, offering them an indication (but no promise) of the broad direction and destination of interest rates.  Surveys suggest this message was understood by a majority of companies and some households.46  By allaying fears about too-rapid a rise in rates, it is likely to have encouraged spending and supported the economy.  When the MPC did come to raise interest rates, in November 2017 and again in August 2018, it is interesting to see how well these were understood by companies and households.  Around three-quarters of households, and around 90% of companies, had expected a rise in rates within the year ahead in surveys held immediately prior to the decisions.  Simple, directional forward guidance on monetary policy appears, for this non-expert audience who comprise most of the spending in the economy, to have been effective.   A second monetary policy example comes from the Bank’s quarterly Inflation Report.  This was first produced over 25 years ago, as part of the first wave of the transparency revolution.  It is a long and technical document, with language requiring at least 13-14 years of education to understand.47  The complexity of its language meant the Report was probably only accessible to around 10% of the population.                                                       45  Bank of England (2013) provides a useful summary of concepts and issues relating to forward guidance;  see Carney (2018) for a more recent discussion. 46  Carney (2018). 47  Haldane (2017a). 
    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 21  21   In November 2017, the Bank began publishing two simpler, “layered” versions of its Report.  Layer 1 is the single sentence/single graphic version, pitched at a level which is accessible to around two-thirds of the population.  Layer 2 is the single page/simple graphics version, accessible to over 40%.  Measured in web hits and downloads, these layered communications appear to have broadened notably the reach of the MPC’s monetary policy messages, in particular among a non-expert audience.    A couple of recent research studies have used experimental methods to look more closely at the impact of the Bank’s simpler communications on public understanding and trust.48  For example, in a randomised control trial of over 2,000 members of the general public, a recent study found that use of the visual summaries increased the public’s understanding of the Inflation Report’s messages by around 25%.  This is a very substantial gain in public understanding for a fairly modest change in format.  This study went, however, one step further and asked whether further improvements in understanding were possible.  The format they considered personalised the language, making it more relatable to people’s everyday lives – for example, by greater use of the first and second person (us/you), greater use of commonly-used words (“rising prices” rather than “inflation”) and with more engaging, interactive graphics.  Doing so increased the gain in public understanding by 40%.      There are limits to what simplification, personalisation and visualisation can achieve.  The same study assessed how these changes in format affected the general public’s trust in the Bank of England’s policies.  These gains were modest.  Perhaps that should come as no surprise.  Understanding is a necessary but not sufficient condition for trust-building.  And trust tends to be earned slowly from repeated experience.  Nonetheless, these studies point to an important role for simpler, personalised communications in lowering the twin deficits.  There probably further for this agenda to run.  For example, there is no reason in principle why the same methods could not be applied to other central bank publications, covering the financial system and banknotes.  The Bank has already made some strides in this direction through its Financial Stability Report and Knowledge Bank, aimed at improving public understanding of the economy and finance.   Looking ahead, in my view greater personalisation of central bank communications holds promise.  Central banks often affect people’s lives in ways which are lagged and indirect and hence difficult for them to observe.  Earlier this year, I constructed “personalised” scorecards, which set out the impact of the Bank’s monetary policy easing actions after the global financial crisis on the income, wealth and well-being of citizens across the UK.49  This recognised that the impact of monetary policy on people’s lives is often quite different depending on their personal circumstances – old versus young, borrower versus saver, home-owner versus renter, North                                                       48  Haldane and McMahon (2018) and Bholat et al (2018). 49  Haldane (2018a).

Casting the impact of monetary policy in terms of averages or aggregates tends not to resonate with people’s personal experience.  Spelling out the benefits in personalised terms can potentially increase understanding and awareness of central banks’ actions.  There is already a precedent for this in another arm of UK policymaking – tax policy.  Taxpayers in the UK receive a personal scorecard, telling them how their tax payments have funded spending on various public goods at the macro-economic level.  This personalisation has been found to have improved the public’s understanding and acceptance of tax policies.50  (b) Public Education  A second way of improving public understanding is through improved public education.  Many central banks have made efforts in this direction over a number of years, including through school visits, schools competitions and schools materials, including at the Bank of England and Bank of Estonia.  That does not yet appear to have satiated demand from pupils and their parents, almost 80% of who say they think economics should form part of the curriculum.51  In part in response, earlier this year the Bank of England launched a new education strategy.  There are a number of elements.  One is a new set of schools competitions, aimed at reaching a broader range of students.  A second is a schools ambassador programme, with Bank officials giving 200 talks in schools across the UK this year.  We are on schedule to hit our target.    The most ambitious part of our education strategy has been to develop classroom materials on the economy and financial system for use in schools as part of the curriculum for pupils aged 11-16.  These go by the name econoME.  As the name suggests, and like our recent public communications efforts, these materials describe the economy and finance in terms which are personal and relatable to young people’s lives.  Why does the economy and finance matter to me?  And how do my decisions in turn affect the economy?  We set ourselves a target of reaching 400 state schools with econoME during the course of this year.  So far since launch in April, over 1,000 schools have downloaded the materials, conceivably covering around 90,000 pupils.52  This demonstrates the potential pent-up demand for school materials on economic and financial issues.  The Bank’s aim is to reach close to 1,500 schools by mid-2020.  We are currently considering where next to take our education initiatives.  A promising avenue would be a younger age range, say 7-11 year olds.  This will require different materials and possibly a different approach.  A more challenging market still would be adults, perhaps linked to existing initiatives to boost                                                       50  Haldane (2018a) and Barnes et al (2017). 51  ING-Economics Network Survey of the Public’s Understanding of Economics (2017). 52  Assuming 30 students per class and 3 classes per school.

The scale of the public understanding deficit means central bank efforts can only be part of the solution but, as public institutions, an important part.   (c) A Distributed Architecture  Central banks historically have tended to be, well, centralised.  But in a world where understanding of the economy is often localised and trust is built on a distributed basis, a centralised infrastructure may be far from ideal.  What is needed instead is a distributed architecture for engagement.  In response, central banks have over time changed their structures and further change seems likely.  The Bank of England has had a network of Agents around the UK for around 90 years.  Today, the Bank’s twelve regional agencies cover all corners of the UK, with an extensive network that generates around 9,000 meetings with company contacts each year.  This is a valuable source of intelligence on the economy and financial system.  Indeed, I would say it is increasingly valuable.  It provides colour and context to accompany our data and models.  It offers folk wisdom, the wisdom of the company crowd.  But companies are only one crowd among many.  Companies are an important lens on the economy, but far from being the only one.  Reflecting that, the Bank has recently sought stronger connections with some other crowds, crowds with a different lens on the economy with which it has perhaps had less contact historically – trades unions, charities, community organisations and the like.  For more than a year, I have augmented those Agents’ efforts with my own “Townhall” meetings across the UK.53  By design, these seek out the views of a wider range of citizens, in a wider range of locations on a wider range of issues around the economy and financial system than has been the case in the past.  These events have established for me that there is wisdom in these crowds when gauging some of the key issues shaping the economy and financial system.  The lived experience of everyday people making everyday decisions is what makes the economy tick (and sometimes tock).  Tapping that lived experience can add to the Bank’s understanding of the economy and help it when setting policy to keep the economy stable.  There is wisdom in crowds of citizens, as there is in crowds of companies.54      The Bank is now taking a further step towards putting in place an infrastructure to formalise its engagement with citizens.  Earlier this year, in response to a recommendation from the RSA, we announced that the Bank would be setting-up a set of Citizens’ Panels across the UK.55  In the remainder of this year, we will be running trials of these citizen panels to help us decide how best to organise them, before rolling them out systematically, UK-wide, next year.                                                        53  See https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/outreach 54  Taylor (2018) also discusses the benefits of deliberative democracy in the RSA’s 2018 Annual Lecture. 55  Haldane (2018b). 
    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 24  24   There are a number of key design questions that need to be answered.  How do you ensure as wide, diverse and representative a set of citizens as possible?  How do you engage citizens who might not understand or trust the Bank?  How much time needs to be set aside to enable the deliberative process to be fruitful?  And how many people should you engage to get the balance right between diversity and deliberation?  We are working with a range of partners, including the RSA, to come up with answers.  The plan would be to set up one citizen panel for each of the Bank’s 12 regional agencies.  With roughly 25 citizens per panel, this would give us a non-expert panel of around 300 people.  This is edging up towards the mid-point of the Wagner/Vinaimont range and just shy of the Athenian boule.  By using digital technology, we would aim to connect these citizen panels to allow national, as well as regional, deliberation.  This is deliberative democracy in practice.  As with the judicial system, it will involve a blend of expert and non-experts.  As with juries and judges, there will be a structured process for deliberation.  As in the legal system, the role of the non-experts (citizen panels) is to help establish the facts and of the experts (MPC) to set policy.  What’s good enough for decisions on incarceration is good enough for decisions on inflation.    Conclusion  Central banks, like all public institutions, were created by the public to serve the public.  Despite a communications revolution, public understanding of central banks remains low and public trust in central banks has fallen.  Improving both calls for a second revolution, focussed on educating and learning from the general public.  The Age of Innocence may be over, but the Era of Engagement has only just begun.  This new era may mean 21st century central banks becoming more disbursed and personalised in their communications, creating new infrastructure to interact with the public and extract their folk wisdom.  Thomas Jefferson said democracy is something you can only learn by doing.  The same is true of central banking.  For the Bank of Estonia entering its second century, and for the Bank of England in its fourth, there is much still to learn and even more to do.

Mario Draghi: The benefits of European supervisionSpeech by Mr Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, at the Autorité de contrôleprudentiel et de resolution (ACPR) Conference on Financial Supervision, Paris, 18 September2018.*   *   *It has long been understood that deeper financial integration would lead to a better functioning ofEconomic and Monetary Union. And when the euro was first introduced there were encouragingsigns that this integration was taking place. Price-based indicators of financial integration showeda pronounced increase, and the standard deviation of interbank lending rates across the euroarea fell to close to zero. Quantity-based measures of financial integration only adjustedsluggishly, as crucial parts of the banking sector, such as retail banking, remained mainlynational.Financial integration proved to be shallow and reversible. At the outbreak of the crisis, interbankmarkets fragmented along national lines and threatened the integrity of the single currency, layingbare the existing fault lines in our Monetary Union.One of these fault lines was the fragmented system of national supervision and resolution. Thetendency of supervisors to promote and defend national champions often prevailed over theUnion’s pursuit of efficiency and stability. Measures deployed during the crisis, such as liquidityring-fencing may have focused on securing domestic financial stability, but they neglected theadverse external effects on other countries. Domestic policies thus tended to reinforce negativespillovers and exacerbate systemic risk across the euro area.The Banking Union addresses these shortcomings by pooling national financial policies at the EUlevel. It has two main objectives: ensuring that banks are sound; and encouraging deeperintegration in the banking sector.European Supervision makes a significant contribution to these objectives. Stronger and uniformsupervision leads to resilient banks and provides a more coherent policy framework for cross-border banking.The benefits of European supervisionEuropean supervision brings three important benefits when compared with the fragmentedsystem of national supervision.First, European supervision harmonises supervisory practices. It has merged the 19 nationalapproaches into one single supervisory method. The Supervisory Review and EvaluationProcess allows supervisors to treat all banks equally by measuring risks against the sameyardstick and setting capital requirements accordingly.Risk assessments have become more harmonised and systematic, significantly improving theconsistency with which capital add-ons are applied across banks. The correlation betweenbanks’ risk profiles and capital requirements increased to 82% in 2017, from just 40% in 2014. Inother words, banks with equivalent risk profiles in the euro area now face similar capitalrequirements.Second, European supervision adopts a system-wide perspective when monitoring andmitigating risks. Supervisors can draw on a comprehensive dataset and information on banksacross the euro area. On this basis, experienced staff from 28 different countries can makecomparisons, spot common weaknesses and monitor potential channels of contagion.123 1 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
This has two benefits. It helps address systemic risks, as better analysis of cross-borderlinkages and spillovers improves the coherence of macro-prudential policies set by nationalauthorities and the ECB, which contributes to reducing excessive risks and cross-borderexternalities.And it supports the identification of bank-specific risks. For example, supervisors have developedanalytical tools to carry out detailed, comparative assessments of banks’ business models.Comparisons within peer groups have helped identify bank-specific issues early on, which arethen addressed with each bank individually.The third benefit of European supervision is that it reduces fragmentation in the supervisoryframework. In the past, broad discretion in applying EU rules led to significant nationaldifferences in key prudential aspects, such as the definition of funds, or capital and liquidityrequirements. The resulting divergences in the capital strength of banks undermined confidencein their soundness.European supervisors identified 175 options and discretions (O&Ds) available under EU law, 130of which are available to national supervisors and are now applied in a uniform way across theeuro area. More harmonised rules have helped re-build confidence in banks and reducecompliance costs for cross-border groups.However, the remaining O&Ds exercised by national legislation still stand in the way of a levelplaying field for banks, and so further legislative action is still needed.Similarly, the decision as to whether a bank should be resolved or liquidated is made moredifficult by different insolvency rules. As a result, some harmonisation of national insolvency rulesis needed to make European resolution more effective.Overall, these three qualitative benefits of European supervision have been instrumental inmaking banks more resilient.Substantial risk reduction has also taken place. The CET 1 ratio of banks supervised by the ECBincreased by 300 basis points between the end of 2014 and the end of 2017 and funding andliquidity are now more stable. In the same period, banks raised their leverage ratios from 4.9% to5.8%, catching up with their US peers.Banks’ improved strength helps them withstand potential shocks. Recent ECB analysis, aspublished in the ECB’s latest Financial Stability Review, has shown that the majority of bankswould maintain average capital buffers over 10% in the event of an adverse shock such as asharp repricing of risk premia or a strong economic slowdown.Improving European supervision to foster banking integrationDespite having a single supervisor and more harmonised rules, the banking market in Europeremains fragmented. 86% of euro area bank lending to firms and households was domestic in2017. And cross-border consolidation, which is one way to increase cross-border lending, hasrecently reached historic lows.More efforts are needed if we want to reap the benefits of an integrated market that helps sharerisks through the private sector and improve macroeconomic stability in the monetary union.In the United States for example, retail banking integration has led to a significant increase in thenumber of multi-state banks. That was not always the case. For example, following the oil pricecollapse in the mid-1980s, almost every bank in Texas failed, creating a state-wide credit crunch.One reason was that that banks were not allowed to operate across states, so the balancesheets of local banks were completely concentrated on their home state.4567 2 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
In a more integrated US banking sector, banks have geographically more diversified loan-booksand deposit bases. By offsetting losses made in crisis-hit states with gains in other states, USbanks are more resilient to local shocks and can keep their lending stable.As a result, US credit markets smooth out a quarter of local shocks, which is significant givenbanks’ much smaller role in financing the economy compared to capital markets. In the euro areaby contrast, risk-sharing through credit markets is much less advanced, despite thepredominantly bank-based nature of the economy. Only 12% of local shocks are smoothedthrough credit markets. Research finds that during the sovereign debt crisis Italian bankstightened their lending and increased interest rates more than foreign banks operating in Italy. So what are the obstacles standing in the way?Of course, there are fundamental legal, judicial and cultural differences between countries, whichhinder cross-border integration. But there are also two important obstacles that exist in the areaof supervision.The first is related to legacy assets, which have weighed on cross-border lending over the pastyears. Banks with high levels of legacy assets have reduced their cross-border exposures inan effort to shore up impaired balance sheets. They have also kept their lending low as theirability to build up capital is limited. Similarly, low profitability and uncertainty regarding thevaluation of legacy assets reduce the appeal of cross-border M&As, as banks still expect largergains from internal restructuring and cost cutting.Significant progress has been made in reducing legacy assets, which include non-performingloans (NPLs) and level 2 and 3 exposures.Over the past three years, the NPL stock of significant banks decreased by one third. Targeted supervisory action helped banks to draw up ambitious reduction plans andgovernance structures for the disposal of NPLs. And more uniform supervisory standards andstricter classifications make it less likely that new NPLs will emerge.But while NPLs are washing out as the economy strengthens, supported by our accommodativemonetary policy, the NPL ratios of euro area banks are still higher than those of US banks.Further efforts are needed from banks, supervisors and regulators to reduce the remaining stockof NPLs, especially in those countries where the NPL ratio remains high.European supervision also needs to continue and extend its work on the valuation of level 2 and 3exposures.The share of Level 1, 2 and 3 assets on the balance sheets of significant institutions has comedown from above 30% to 23% of significant institutions’ total assets. Level 3 assets decreasedfrom €188 billion to €132 billion, constituting less than 1% of significant institutions’ total assets.Although the average share of Level 3 assets on the balance sheet of the largest euro areabanks is now lower than that of US banks, some banks in the euro area still have high shares ofLevel 3 assets, if compared with international competitors, hampering further bank consolidationin the EU.It is crucial that banks have sound and effective valuation and risk management frameworks inplace. Therefore, sustained supervisory efforts are needed to identify and address potentialproblems with banks’ valuation and classification methods. Dedicated inspections wereperformed with the objective of evaluating the soundness and effectiveness of the valuationframework, the controls over the pricing models used to produce fair values, and the adequacy ofthe classification of positions measured at fair value. Supervisory efforts remain high with on-siteinspections, deep dives and benchmarking exercises already planned or ongoing.89101112131415 3 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
The second obstacle to cross-border integration lies within the prudential framework.At present, regulatory capital cannot be freely allocated across subsidiaries of cross-bordergroups. Banks are required to comply with capital requirements on a standalone basis andwaivers can only be applied to domestic banking groups.Similarly, while the free movement of liquidity across borders is made possible by cross-borderwaivers, the practical application of these waivers is hampered by the remaining nationalprerogatives in the regulatory framework which allow national authorities to apply large exposurelimits on intragroup lending and ring-fence liquidity.For example, the requirement to comply with the liquidity coverage ratio at individual level locksup liquidity in cross-border subsidiaries of G-SIBs of up to €130bn. Some of this liquidity couldpotentially be freely allocated if impediments, such as large exposure limits on intragroup lending,were removed and euro area waivers granted. The effects may be significant, given theimportance of intra group lending in the euro area, which in 2017 accounted for 70% of cross-border lending.The free movement of funds is a precondition for a single banking market. With theestablishment of European supervision, there is less reason to restrict this free movement.European supervision is able to identify and address financial stability risks posed by crossborder groups, reducing the need for national safeguards. And this is all the more true as national safety netsfor resolution and deposit protection are gradually being shifted to the EU level.Removing the obstacles to the free movement of funds could improve financial integration byallowing banks to allocate resources efficiently across countries. US banks, for instance, rely onintra-group funding to respond to local shocks and manage the credit growth of their subsidiaries,allowing them to keep their lending and income streams more stable to economic fluctuations.Other regulatory factors are also hampering cross-border integration. Currently, the internationalregulatory framework does not treat the euro area as a single jurisdiction for the purposes ofcalculating capital surcharges (G-SIB buffers). In other words, intra-euro area cross-border loansfrom euro area banks are considered foreign loans, leading to higher systemic risk scores andcapital requirements relative to their international peers. Against this background, it is crucial thatreforms to complete the banking union do not lose steam, so that the euro area can be treatedas a single jurisdiction in the international G-SIB framework.ConclusionAs much as the global financial crisis has exposed weaknesses in the regulation and supervisionof banks around the world, in the EU such weaknesses were exacerbated by fragmentation.From the early stages of the crisis the banking sector fragmented along national lines, driven bydiverging macroeconomic conditions in different countries and by governments’ divergingresponses in dealing with failing banks. Differently from the US, common resolution frameworksbackstopped by public money were absent. Governments that could do so, because of theirsound budgets, massively bailed out their failed banks. An opportunity for bank consolidation waslost, but their economies were spared a credit crisis after a financial crisis.In other countries where bailouts were not possible due to constrained finances or newregulatory restrictions introduced by the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD), thecrisis lasted much longer. European supervision and the European framework for managingbank failures, of which the BRRD is an important part, have made such a cause offragmentation, namely the different countries’ responses to banking crises less likely today. Butmore needs to be done.161718 4 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
Progress in completing the Banking Union – namely, first harmonising options and discretions,completing resolution, and laying the groundwork for the creation of an effective depositinsurance – is essential and I am confident that significant steps in this direction will soon betaken.But let’s keep in mind that fragmentation starts with the decision by banks not to operate inregions where the risk-return of lending is judged to be insufficient to remunerate their investedcapital Ultimately, what ensures a steady flow of bank lending to the economy, even in times ofunforeseen stress or disruption, is a growth-friendly environment, which can only be assured bythe appropriate government policies.Report to the Council and the Commission on the realisation by stages of Economic and Monetary Union in theCommunity (Werner Report), 1970; Report on economic and monetary union in the European Community(Delors Report), 1989; Padoa-Schioppa T.

François Villeroy de Galhau: Financial supervision and the role ofnational authorities in EuropeOpening address by Mr François Villeroy de Galhau, Governor of the Bank of France, at theAutorité de contrôle prudentiel et de resolution (ACPR) Conference on Financial Supervision,Paris, 18 September 2018.*   *   *Mr. President [M. Draghi], Ms. Chair [D. Nouy],Mesdames, Messieurs, Bonjour et bienvenue à Paris,It is a particular pleasure to welcome you to this conference on financial supervision and the roleof national authorities in Europe. What better way to inaugurate the new headquarters of theACPR – France’s supervision authority – than to bring in colleagues and experts from across thecontinent.  I urge you to look at a few street names in the neighbourhood: this borough is called inParis “quartier de l’Europe” – very much in the spirit of what we are doing together at the SSM.I warmly thank President Mario Draghi for being here. Before giving him the floor, let me stressthat we all have reasons to be proud of what has been achieved for Banking Union in the pastfew years. But we must not be complacent. There are two priorities: one in substance, and onein method.**I. Our priority in substance: strengthening the second pillar on resolutionNow that we’ve had the Single Supervisory Mechanism up and running for four years, it’s easyto forget that there were many sceptics who were sure that such a union could not beachieved. But, as Mark Twain would have said, “[we] didn’t know it was impossible so [we] did it.”Today it is a tangible reality. In fact our supervisory practices have been harmonised upwards.Our legal framework is stronger thanks to the single rulebook. And European banks are sounder– the CET1 solvency ratio for major institutions has increased by more than 3 points since 2014(from 11.3% to 14.6% at the end of last year). Danièle [Nouy], you deserve our congratulations onthis achievement!Yet Banking Union’s second pillar, the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM), is still incomplete.Yes we have already managed our first cases, substantially improving the health of a number ofbanks, notably in Spain and Italy. But making the SRM fully operational should be our toppriority. In my opinion, it is the common backstop to the Single Resolution Fund that is really the key.Experience from abroad is instructive: in most large jurisdictions, in particular the United Statesand the United Kingdom, the intervention capabilities of resolution funds are backstopped by thefiscal authorities. And they are not a burden on public finances, since any public outlays aregenerally reimbursed by the private sector. The euro area agreement on the backstop reachedon the 29th of June is a crucial first step. It is now urgent to deliver on it by the end of 2018. Twokey issues remain: how to fund the backstop at a sufficiently high level to be credible, andhow to create a swift decision-making process to deal with emergencies – if we need 1 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
weeks, it is useless. The euro area also needs a system for providing liquidity to financiallysound banks after resolution – one that is provided by the Eurosystem and secured by a high-quality public guarantee. I’m fully convinced that once we have a credible and efficient mechanism for resolution, it will bemuch easier to reach a pragmatic compromise on deposit insurance, probably with a focus onliquidity sharing between national guarantee schemes. Let me add two thoughts on substance:First, on anti-money laundering. In this area, I am convinced that we need to enhance ourapproach by building on a network of national authorities and EBA that should ensure aneffective single anti-money laundering supervision. This means that EBA should have thelegal and human capacities to foster convergence of practices on the best standards, basedon clear European mandates. It should go as far as including effective breach of law reviewsand a capacity to directly intervene in some cases with European-wide impact.  Second, what we have managed to achieve for banks can serve as an example for financialmarkets. If we truly want to enhance financial integration for the purpose of better private risksharing and convergence across Europe, we need to advance the Capital Markets Unionagenda: we should in particular strengthen ESMA’s role as a supervisory authority, at leastwith regard to wholesale market oversight – while duly involving national authorities whenappropriate. The Chairman of the AMF is a talented advocate of this.II. Our priority in method: developing synergies within the SSM as a wholeLet me come back to the SSM. After only four years of existence, it is now fully operational, withmore than 2,300 supervisory decisions in 2017 alone. Those of you who work within the SSM arethe living breathing reality of European integration. Every day you prove that closer cooperation,closer union is not a dream of the past but something we are still capable of today.Part of the SSM’s success stems from its design: the mechanism constitutes an original modelof federalism, based on a close and continuous collaboration between the ECB and nationalauthorities at all levels: from the composition of the Supervisory Board to the Joint SupervisoryTeams (JSTs), the on-site teams and staff secondments.This does not mean that all is rosy and that culture and practices have fully converged within theSSM. Success allows us to consider now how the day-to-day functioning of the SSM can still beimproved. In my view, there are three main strategic priorities:The first one is to further simplify processes. I welcome the current initiatives, including thecreation of the Simplification Group chaired by Petra Senkovic from the ECB and EdouardFernandez-Bollo from the ACPR. Various measures are under development, like thegrowing use of delegation, the streamlining of SREP or JST functioning. However, anessential challenge will be to make sure that all processes will remain optimised over timeand that simplification becomes a full and permanent part of decision-making, fromconception to execution. To do so, simplification has to become one of the values that guidethe SSM.The second priority is to promote mobility, thanks in particular to staff secondments andmore on-site supervisors working on banks outside their home country. Other initiativescould include very short staff exchanges or swaps within JSTs, between the ECB andnational authorities, to allow members to better understand the culture and practices of their 2 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
counterparts.The third and final priority is to develop synergies. Just as with the Eurosystem, theBanking Union constitutes a system with a strong center and strong national components,which ultimately have to act as one team. The goal is to make the best use of nationalresources by fostering their participation in all key tasks of the SSM. National authoritiesshould not hesitate to step up their involvement in the SSM. In return, the ECB should furtherempower national authorities, especially in the framework of day-to-day supervision and inthe field of on-site inspections in branches or subsidiaries of significant institutions. Speakingfor France, the ECB can obviously rely upon the ACPR: its well-trained employees andinspectors are fully committed to serve the SSM common good alongside their ECBcolleagues. As regards on-site inspections and cross-border missions, further efforts shouldbe made in order to tackle administrative hurdles. But I can already say that the ACPR willaim to double its target of cross-border missions in 2019.Strong cooperation between national authorities and the ECB is needed in banking supervision,but not exclusively. Let’s not forget that a majority of national authorities are competent in otherfields of supervision, which matter for the SSM, such as insurance – which is the case for theACPR. These competences are valuable not only for the supervision of financial conglomeratesbut also for the development of a more unified single market for insurance. In cooperation withEIOPA, we are committed to preserving it after Brexit. **Let me conclude. Ten years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, we have learnt three mainlessons. First, we need competent, strong and independent supervision. Second, we need alevel playing field, at least in Europe, and if possible at the international level, for theimplementation of the strengthened rules: without demanding supervision, regulation and thesingle rulebook could largely remain a paper exercise. Last but not least, we must never let ourguard down when it comes to financial stability. Anniversaries have to be a bastion against thetemptation to forget and fall asleep. The SSM is the fruit of all these lessons… and, under yourresponsibility, the best guarantee for the future. Thank you for your attention. 3 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
Vitas Vasiliauskas: Lithuania's pension system - how to ensuresocially just and sustainable pensions?Welcome remarks by Mr Vitas Vasiliauskas, Governor of the Bank of Lithuania, at the Economicsconference of the Bank of Lithuania, Vilnius, 17 September 2018.*   *   *Dear colleagues, like-minded guests and potential opponents,Thank you for joining us at the second economics conference of the Bank of Lithuania. We aredelighted to have you here.When we decided to organise these annual conferences, we set ourselves an ambitious goal:what we seek is not only original insights and interesting discussions (although I make no secretof the fact that we are hoping for these, too), but also tangible results. It would not surprise me,then, if new and even unexpected ideas emerged from our sessions. At the same time, we aimto assess experiences tested in real-life conditions. In short, we seek concrete conclusions andproposals for resolving pressing economic problems.It is this urgent need that dictates our choice of topics. Accordingly, last year’s conferencefocused on the issues of income inequality. Following a thorough discussion and analysis, weconcluded that inequality of income and, consequently, of opportunities, stems largely from ourtax and pension systems. We agreed that these systems required an immediate and radicaloverhaul. Thus, today’s topic – the Lithuanian pension system – is a natural continuation of thatimportant discussion.Since the ice has at last been broken, however, we can approach this crucial issue from a newangle. The Government has undertaken to reform the pension system which, sooner or later, inone way or another, will affect everything and everyone: everyday life as well as national publicfinances and macroeconomic stability. Such an all-encompassing topic warrants particularattention from public institutions, the public and the media. The Bank of Lithuania took an activepart – and will be actively involved in the future – in expert discussions, commensurate with howit perceives its institutional duty.In short, the situation can be summarised as follows: a step in the right direction has been made.However, only a step.The work is far from complete since, first, it is important not only to design solutions but also toimplement them qualitatively.And, second, it is already clear that even if we faultlessly follow through with what has beeninitiated, some elements of the Lithuanian pension system will still need to be improved. Inparticular, what I have in mind is the need to increase transparency of the first pillar and tostrengthen people’s confidence in it. These issues will become increasingly important in thefuture. They will have to be addressed – and the sooner, the better.Thus, today, I suggest that we set our gaze slightly beyond the visible horizon. In other words, Ipropose that in today’s discussions, we consider the future of our pension system from theperspective of several decades rather than simply several years.Let’s take a moment, however, to notice our starting position: the status quo of the Lithuanianpension system and its envisaged developments. Let’s briefly review the Bank of Lithuania’sassessment and several key proposals which might help us take further steps in the directionoutlined by the reform. 1 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
Colleagues,We face two major problems: poor benefits now and the prospect of even poorer pensions in thefuture.About the present. The average old-age pension is close to the poverty line. Speaking aboutresidents receiving only a Sodra pension, the average replacement rate, that is, the ratio betweenpre-retirement labour income and pension, is only about 35 per cent, whereas the EU averagecomes close to 50 per cent. Approximately one in four senior citizens in Lithuania is exposed tothe risk of poverty – according to the European Commission, once again we are ranked in thebottom three of EU countries. We find ourselves in this – third lowest – position quite often, andwe are even starting to come to terms with it. However, there is another important indicator – theratio between pension expenditure per pensioner and GDP per capita. Regrettably, this indicatorranks us in an even lower position.About the future. The International Monetary Fund estimates that, with no reform of the systemundertaken, the average replacement rate for residents who do not independently save forretirement would further decrease and reach only 20 per cent over the coming decades. Thismeans that, in the absence of change, in a couple of decades pensions – calculated at thepresent monetary value – will be almost one-quarter smaller than they are now.Nowadays, there are a number of reasons for poor old-age benefits. One of them is a low level ofredistribution through the state budget. Last year, the amount of tax revenue in Lithuania wasbelow 30 per cent of GDP, while the EU average was almost 40 per cent. By comparison, hadwe collected the amount of tax revenue at least equivalent to the EU average, our budgetaryinflows would have been about 2 billion euros higher. Is this a lot or a little? That is almost asmuch as the amount of total pension expenditure that year.The level of redistribution (and thus budget availability) is primarily an issue of the equity andefficiency of tax policy. Nevertheless, even if the most effective changes in taxation wereimplemented, they would not be enough on their own in the longer term. This is becausealongside redistribution problems we have another adverse factor, namely, a highly complicateddemographic situation. This leads to a worsening ratio between working-age and retirement-agepopulation, which implies a heavier burden on public finances.Against this background, it has become crucial to create the right conditions and incentives forincome-generating residents to start accumulating their own financial reserves for old age. Tothe best of our knowledge, however, so far about 800 thousand persons – more than half of theworking population – rely only on minimum accumulation or refrain from acummulatingaltogether. I do not want to sound too dramatic, but… this situation cannot be called anythingother than a ticking time bomb.Our honourable speakers will shortly present a broader picture – the practices of other countriesand regions. We are likely to see that our challenges are not unique: most advanced economieshave faced, or are currently facing, similar problems. And although they all have specific nationalcharacteristics and thus each seeks the most suitable solutions in its national context, all highlyregarded models share certain features. First of all, one finds a focus on long-term sustainability.Second, one notes transparency and, consequently, a high level of confidence among thepopulation. These features contribute to the achievement of the core objective, namely, to ensuremore even consumption, that is, level of income, throughout the human life cycle.The pension systems of our close neighbours, the Nordic countries, are considered among thebest-rated in the world and are characterised by all of these features. I am therefore pleased thatwe will soon have the opportunity to hear professor Edward Palmer’s presentation on theSwedish experience in reforming their pension system and shifting towards a notional definedcontribution-based model. 2 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
Colleagues,When analysing the good practices of foreign countries, we note that, in addition to theaforementioned similarities, they have one more thing in common: none of the pension systemsin which people today have confidence was created in a single sweep. Quite to the contrary, theywere developed through protracted processes that called for consistency and patience.The Lithuanian pension system, too, has for some time been on the path of review andtransformation, on a greater or smaller scale. And even though one might argue about themeaning of certain “reconstructions”, and in particular their consistency and completeness, Ibelieve that the recent decisions may create the conditions for favourable change.First, the system gains more integrity. Having changed the structure of contributions to second-pillar pension funds (ceasing transfers of state social insurance contributions), there is no reasonfor an artificial confrontation between the first and second pillars.The second advantage is the likelihood of more people enrolling in second-pillar pension funds.This would mean that more people would be better prepared for loss of labour income in thefuture. At the national level, this would contribute to the sustainability of the pension system andhelp mitigate the future demographic shock that awaits us.The third point of particular importance for us is safer and more efficient saving. The Bank ofLithuania has found that, at present, almost two-thirds of persons participating in the secondpillar save in funds with a risk profile inappropriate for their age. This inadequacy is a majorobstacle to the efficient use of all opportunities that financial markets have to offer, preventing theaccumulation of the maximum possible reserve for the future, with an optimum level of riskassumed. The decision to introduce so-called life-cycle pension funds in Lithuania is, therefore,truly welcome. This would help end the practice of “one size fits all” (which really does not fitanybody), and the investment risk of the assets accumulated correlate with the certain stage inthe accumulator’s life, i.e. his specific age.Finally, the maintenance cost of the system. Centralised administration of annuities in Sodra, anon-profit institution, would reduce their cost. On the other hand, limiting the maximum alloweddeductions by private pension funds would help residents to accumulate more for old age.Will the proposed changes be enough to ensure the long-term sustainability of the Lithuanianpension system and to better tailor it to the needs of the population?Certainly yes. And, at the same time, certainly no. If these ideas are put into practice asenvisaged, our reformed model may very well become both more attractive and more robustthan the present system. However, if we seek to align with international leaders, we must takecare not to get stuck with what has been designed so far.Having said that, I hasten to assure everyone that we believe stability to be the greatest virtue ofthe pension system. Still, the Lithuanian pension system will require three further improvements.The first one should ensure a closer and definitely more obvious connection betweencontributions and benefits. This is an essential condition both for achieving pension-systemfairness and for strengthening incentives for residents to pay contributions.The second aim is greater transparency. Having strengthened the connection betweencontributions and benefits, the first pension pillar should shift towards a model based onindividual accounts (notional defined contribution model) – like the one currently in operation inSweden, Norway, Poland and other European countries.Such a system, ideally operating in real time, would clearly show the correlation between one’s 3 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
social insurance contributions and the level of his or her future pension. A virtual individualaccount would demonstrate that unaccounted income reduces the accumulative pension in thefirst pillar, thus encouraging the payment of contributions.The third direction concerns information and education. Clear communication on the old-agesaving system is one of the most reliable means for managing risks of short-sighted choices.And – let’s face it – there is such a threat if, after the entry into force of the approved changes ofthe pension system, people decide to opt for slightly higher income today, rather than in thefuture.Currently, these are the three missing pieces of the puzzle of the Lithuanian pension system.Colleagues,I do not wish to be a prophet of doom, but the risks facing the Lithuanian pension system are veryreal. Unless we accomplish urgent work, we will soon face them – if not just round the corner,then around another couple of turns.In order to create a truly sustainable – and I insist sustainable in the long run – pension systemin which Lithuanians will have trust, we must strive for consensus, consistency anddetermination for further steps. Today, we have the opportunity to talk about these issues boldly,openly and in good faith.I wish you all fruitful discussions and valuable insights, which may contribute to future policydecisions.Thank you.   4 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches

     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 2  2   It is a pleasure to deliver this lecture in honour of TK Whitaker.   Whitaker’s career in public policy spanned a period of profound structural change in the Irish economy.  In 1956, when he became Secretary of the Department for Finance, the Irish economy was isolated and uncompetitive.  Growth in output per capita was lagging the rest of Europe and the steady tide of emigration was gradually shrinking the population.  By the time Whitaker’s career drew to a close, the Celtic Tiger was roaring: Ireland had caught up with even the most prosperous nations in the EU, GDP growth was averaging over 5%, and the population had increased by two-thirds as emigration switched to immigration. The catalyst for this transformation was opening up to foreign trade and investment.  Beginning with the 1958 report Economic Development, Whitaker strongly advocated replacing the old strategy of self-sufficiency with a new one of export-led growth, which led in time to Ireland joining the EU.  For many, this is the greatest long-term consequence of his work.   But as students of economic history know (and policymakers learn at their cost), without the right institutions, structural changes – whether large changes to trading relationships or technological revolutions – can be painful.   Whitaker recognised that “Readiness to adapt to changing conditions is a sine qua non for economic success”1 and that adaptability required a series of changes to Ireland’s institutions.  Major reforms to education were essential to match the skills of the Irish workforce to the potential jobs that increased inward investment could bring.  A 1964 report on Manpower Policy, which Whitaker oversaw as chair, advocated greater investment in the STEM subjects, readying a generation for the IT revolution.2  More broadly, Ireland repeatedly increased standards of education, beginning with the introduction of universal secondary schooling in 1967, resulting in levels of educational attainment today that exceed the OECD average.3   Whitaker also advocated reforms of labour market institutions – to tackle restrictive work practices and ensure pay was more closely linked to productivity.4   Emphasis was also placed on a competitive environment for business to help attract foreign capital, in part through the overhaul of the corporate tax regime.  And improvements were made to infrastructure, such as power supplies and transport services.                                                                  1 Taken from “Economic Development”, a report on the Irish Economy overseen by Whitaker and published in 1958. 2 Whitaker played a central role in improving education in the public sector.  His concern “that the variety and difficulty of administrative problems have so increased, and the tools and techniques for solving them have so developed, as to render administration more than ever a science” resulted in the creation of the Institute of Public Administration in 1957.  To this day, the Institute continues to provide education, training and research to the public sector, enabling better policy making through a better understanding of the Irish economy.  In addition, Whitaker was instrumental in setting up the Economic and Social Research Institute – the first institution to provide independent research and analysis of the Irish economy. 3 For example, nine Regional Technical Colleges were established during the 1970s to provide vocational tertiary level training.  The Industrial Development Authority ensured that government funding of higher education adapted to meet businesses’ increasing demands for skilled labour in areas such as engineering and computer sciences, helping to ensure people could develop the skills necessary to work in the expanding sectors. 4 Whitaker, TK (1955/1956) 'Capital formation, saving and economic progress', Dublin: Journal of the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland, Vol. XVIX, pp. 184-209. 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 3  3   The Irish experience over the past half century reinforces the lessons learnt in the UK from the three profound technological revolutions – institutions are essential to smooth the major transitions and to ensure their promise is realised by as many as possible. Getting institutions right is critical not just for core economic outcomes but for broader well-being. The fundamental challenge is that alongside the great benefits they ultimately bring, every technological revolution mercilessly destroys jobs and livelihoods – and therefore identities – well before the new ones emerge.  This was true of the eclipse of agriculture and cottage industry by the industrial revolution, the development of the production line, the displacement of manufacturing by the service economy.5   We are on the cusp of a Fourth Industrial Revolution, which has the potential to transform fundamentally the nature of both work and commerce through advances in AI, automation and interconnectedness.    Our economies are reorganising into a series of distributed peer-to-peer connections across powerful networks – revolutionising how people consume, work and communicate.  The nature of commerce is changing.  Sales are increasingly taking place online and over platforms, rather than on the high street.  Intangible capital is now more important than physical capital.6  We are entering an age when anyone will be able to produce anything anywhere through 3-D printing, where anyone can broadcast their performance globally via YouTube or sell to China whatever the size of their business via Tmall. Today, I want to discuss how we can apply the lessons from the history of the first three industrial revolutions to the fourth to secure a future that benefits all.   Crisis?  What Crisis? Some economists wonder what all the fuss is about.  They argue that there has been little evidence, over the long term, of technological unemployment.  After all, average employment and unemployment rates today are similar to those in the 18th century.                                                                    5 The First Industrial Revolution (1760 – 1840) saw the mechanisation of (mainly the textile) industry with the introduction of steam power, moving people from home-based to factory-based production in urban areas.  The Second Industrial Revolution (1860 – 1914) was driven by the introduction of electricity to manufacturing, extending mechanised, assembly-line mass production to broader industries.  The Third Industrial Revolution (1970 – 2000) was defined by the move from mechanical/analogue to digital, with wide-spread adoption of electronics from both the home and work environment.  The Fourth Industrial Revolution (2000 – current) anticipates the dawn of true Artificial Intelligence in light of advances in robotics, nanotechnology and quantum computing. 6 In the UK, intangible investment rose above tangible investment in the early 2000s, and stood at 11% as a share of output in 2014 compared with 10% for tangible investment. Investment in intangibles also exceeded that in tangibles in the US, Sweden and Finland [on average over 1999-2003], but not in other European countries including German, Italy and Spain. See Haskel, J and Westlake, W (2017), ‘Capitalism Without Capital: The Rise of the Intangible Economy’, Princeton University Press; and Goodridge, P R, Haskel, J and Wallis, G (2016), ‘Accounting for the UK Productivity Puzzle: A Decomposition and Predictions’, Economica, Vol. 85, Issue 339. 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 4  4   But such big transitions take time.  Workers generally cannot move seamlessly to new jobs in which they can be productive.  The benefits of the First Industrial Revolution, which began in the latter half of the 18th century, were not felt fully in productivity and wages until the second half of the 19th.7   Indeed, at the start of the 19th century in the UK, despite a sharp pickup in productivity, wage growth stalled and the labour share fell – a period dubbed “Engels’ pause”. A Framework for Examining Technical Change and the Labour Market To understand such dynamics it helps to have a common conceptual framework.8  The impact of technological change on employment and wages can be depicted as the sum of three major effects: destruction, productivity and creation. The destruction effect is the focus of most alarmist accounts: the replacement of labour by technology, with an associated reduction in labour demand, wages and employment.  Less commonly acknowledged are the positive effects on aggregate demand of new technologies, what can be termed the productivity effect.  This effect is analogous to the classic Say’s law in which supply creates its own demand.  Technology makes those in work more productive, in time boosting wages and increasing the returns to those who own capital.  This greater income boosts aggregate demand and leans against the destruction effect.   When technological change is disruptive and widespread, the productivity effect is generally insufficient to counteract completely the destruction effect, partly because of the time it takes for the full potential of new technologies to be realised, and partly because of the phenomenon of greater job polarisation – to which I will turn to in a moment. As a consequence, over the medium term, technological change tends to reduce labour’s share of income.   Historically, however, technological progress has not led to permanent declines in the labour share because of a third effect – the creation of new tasks for labour.9  When combined with the productivity effect, this ultimately has counterbalanced the displacement effects of technology, boosting productivity and wages while leaving employment unaffected.                                                                    7 Partly there is a lag in reorganising enough of the economy to the advantage of the new general purpose technology for aggregate productivity growth to increase. 8 The following is based on Acemoglu, D and Restrepo, P (2018), ‘Artificial Intelligence, Automation and Work’, NBER Working Paper No. 24196. 9 This creation effect need not be fully exogenous to the technological change, for example because the new technologies allow new jobs to emerge that wouldn’t otherwise be possible – though of course factors like education and skills are important in determining how quickly and smoothly these gains come about. 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 5  5   Could this time be different? The Fourth Industrial Revolution could differ from its three predecessors in terms of scope, scale and speed. Scope Thus far, each wave of technological change has increased the importance of cognitive tasks relative to non-cognitive ones.  In other words, machines have largely substituted for human hands not heads.  Workers have been able to improve their skills and take on newly created sets of cognitive, higher value tasks – tasks beyond the cognitive limits of machines.   Rapid improvements in computing power, the increased availability of big data and advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning mean smarter machines are already replacing a broader range of human activities than before, reaching well into the range of “heads”.  New technologies may increasingly provide intelligence, sensory perception, and reasoning which previously only labour could provide.  Technological optimists10 believe future automation will move beyond substituting for the ‘routine-manual’ human tasks technology performed in the late 20th century to almost the entire spectrum of work.11   It may be left to people to provide “hearts” – that is, tasks that require emotional intelligence, originality or social skills such as persuasion or caring for others.  And if new forms of bespoke mass creativity are made possible by the new global economy, human “hands” may once again take over (a form of cottage industry going full circle).12  One thing that could be different is the effects of demographics.  An ageing population will lead to greater demand for care and a straight decrease in labour supply.13 Scale The greater scope of the Fourth Industrial Revolution could mean its scale is larger too.  Unlike in previous episodes, the jobs most at risk of automation are likely to lie across the entire spectrum of wages.14 At one extreme, Frey and Osborne (2017)15 estimate that around half of US employment is at ‘high risk’16 of automation, over an unspecified period of time.                                                                   10 For example, Brynjolfsson, E and McAfee, A (2014), ‘The Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies’.  The most extreme view of this is put forward by Daniel Susskind, who highlights the possibility that in the future machines can perform all tasks leading to technological unemployment (Susskind, D (2017), ‘A model of technological unemployment’, University of Oxford, Department of Economics Series Working Papers, No. 819). 11 The question at the heart of this debate is whether we can overcome ‘Polanyi’s Paradox’ - that “we can know more than we can tell” (Polanyi 1966).  Our inability to detail these tasks (such as social interactions) in a formulaic manner currently makes them difficult to encode and automate. 12 McKinsey (2017) also suggest demand for creative and social skills will increase. 13 I am grateful to my colleague Silvana Tenreyro for suggesting this point. 14 Brynjolfsson, E, Mitchell, T and Rock,D (2018), ‘What Can Machines Learn and What Does It Mean for Occupations and the Economy’, AEA Papers and Proceedings, Vol. 108, pp. 43-47. 15 Frey, C B and Osborne, M (2017), ‘The future of employment: How susceptible are jobs to computerisation?’, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, Vol. 114, pp. 254-280. 16 Defined as roles with over 70% chance of automation.

Each job usually has some components which cannot be automated, even if many of its central components can be.  Indeed, evidence increasingly suggests that while large parts of many jobs will be subject to automation, relatively few jobs will be completely automated.17  Felten, Raj and Seamans (2017)18 show that recent advances in technology can be used to predict future changes in the task structure of occupations, lending further support to the argument that technological advancement will likely change the nature of many jobs rather than eliminate them completely. The more extreme estimates are often based purely on technical feasibility of automation with limited consideration of economic feasibility.  For example, it may be possible to automate the pouring of drinks in bars, but doing so may not present a cost saving over hiring bar staff to do the job let alone the ancillary benefit of being able to tell them your troubles. Taking these additional considerations into account reduces the share of jobs at high risk of automation to some 10% in the UK and 15% in Ireland.19  That appears comparable with the three previous episodes of technological revolution, which saw the share of aggregate employment accounted for by the most exposed industries fall by between 10 to 20% over long periods. Some argue that the greater scope and scale of tasks (as opposed to jobs) at risk of replacement by technology means that new job creation might no longer increase overall employment.  That is, the destruction effect may outweigh the combined impact of the productivity and creation effects.   At the same time, the range of tasks at risk could substantially increase the impact on inequality for several reasons.  Most fundamentally, the more new technology substitutes for labour rather than complements it, the more the gains would accrue to capital rather than labour.  An unequal distribution of capital means that increasing automation will push up inequality by construction.  In the transition, what economists euphemistically call frictions can lead to depressed local or national labour markets, boosting inequality.20 And if education is unable to keep pace with the changing demand for skills, those who already have the skills to use new technologies will earn even higher premiums.21  Job polarisation will increase the supply of labour competing for lower skilled jobs.22  Greater global interconnectedness will reinforce these dynamics.                                                                    17 For example, McKinsey Global Institute (2017), ‘A Future that Works:  Automation, Employment and Productivity’ suggest that 60% of occupations could see over 30% of their tasks replaced by technology, based on O*NET analysis. 18 Felten, E W, Raj, M and Seamans, R (2018), ‘A Method to Link Advances in Artificial Intelligence to Occupational Abilities, AEA Papers and Proceedings, Vol. 108, pp. 54-57. 19 Nedelkoska, L and Quintini, G (2018), ‘Automation, skills use and training’, OECD Social, Employment and Migration Working Papers No. 202.  Similarly, McKinsey argue that across advanced economies 15% of the workforce in total will need to shift occupational categories because of digitisation, automation, and AI. 20 This process has been well documented for the China Shock in the US (Autor, Dorn and Hanson 2015) and the collapse of local housing markets (Mian and Sufi 2015). 21 If those who understand technology less well are less willing to trust it and work with it, this could further increase its polarising effects.

Certainly, the time taken for new technologies to be adopted has shortened dramatically since the dawn of the First Industrial Revolution. The Story Thus Far Current empirical work suggests on balance that, thus far, increased automation has been positive for employment in aggregate even though it has led to substantial compositional changes.  Importantly, while technology has reduced middle-skilled employment, its effects on aggregate employment appear to have been more than offset by increased product demand and local demand spillovers.  After all, the employment share in the UK is near all-time highs.  There are, however, signs that recent technological advances have increased inequality.  Globally, labour has seen its share of income fall over the past twenty years and the IMF (2017) finds that technological progress during the 3rd Industrial Revolution has been the biggest contributor to this decline.  The UK and Ireland23 are outliers:  in both countries, the labour share has been flat, and income inequality stable – if high – since the late 1980s.24 Moreover, there is strong evidence that advanced economy labour markets have been polarising since the 1980s – a structural shift that have generally been attributed to technological displacement of mid-skilled jobs resulting from the early stages of automation and digitisation of tasks.  Employment growth has been strongest at the high and low skilled ends of the jobs spectrum, resulting in a hollowing out of mid-skilled employment.  The polarisation of the labour market has also been evident in the returns to skilled labour, with earnings growth for those with higher levels of education far outstripping those with less schooling.   So in summary thus far, if the Fourth Industrial Revolution is similar to past technological revolutions, the overall effect will eventually be labour augmenting – boosting productivity and wages, while creating new jobs to maintain or even increase overall employment.   But that is in the long run.  In the interim, if it is similar to previous industrial revolutions, it seems likely there will be a period of technological unemployment, dislocation and rising inequality.  Given that it could happen more rapidly, the challenge of workforce adjustment could be more difficult.  The shifts required in employment from jobs involving heads to those with hearts and hands could be far greater each year than seen in previous episodes.  Moreover, unlike in the previous industrial revolutions, the more rapid pace of adjustment and longer working lives means workers may not have the option of retiring.  This                                                                                                                                                                                                                      22 Analysis by the IMF indicates that the extent of job polarisation depends far more on the ease of substitution between labour and technology than it does on the relative price of technology.  23 Calculating the labour share using gross national income and removing distortions that stem from how multinational corporations account for their global operations by excluding retained earnings of firms that have re-domiciled to Ireland, the depreciation of foreign-owned intellectual property assets located in Ireland, and the depreciation of aircraft owned by aircraft-leasing companies. 24 The low level of automation in the UK – which Hal Varian has suggested could be linked to the size of the automobile and electronics sectors – may be one reason why the UK labour share has remained resilient.

What could we do to shorten the lags?  What does history teach us about building Whitaker’s adaptability today? Institutions to Cushion the Blow and Speed the Transformation In past industrial revolutions, the actions of public, private and third party institutions have helped shrink the duration, impact and cost of the transition.  It is worth reflecting on these interventions as we think about how to manage the transition to the Fourth Industrial Revolution.25 The skills bases of workers were fundamentally transformed by a series of reforms to enabling institutions including primary, secondary and tertiary education.26  New insurance institutions were created to support those left behind in the transition, including unemployment insurance and universal health care.27  And labour market institutions – cooperatives, trades unions, and the introduction of a minimum wage and private company pensions – plugged gaps in provisions.28,29 Throughout these periods, many employers helped create an environment in which employees could thrive.  From charitable support in the First Industrial Revolution; to the Ford era of self-interested paternalism in between, and the GooglePlex, self-contained communities of today, business has shaped the welfare of many.                                                                      25 My colleague Andy Haldane has also discussed these issues.  See ‘Ideas and Institutions – A Growth Story’, speech given at The Guild Society, Oxford, 23 May 2018. 26 In the UK in the late 18th and early 19th century, a mix of public, private and religious institutions – largely driven by charitable motives – brought education to children working in mills.  In the second and third revolutions, the state established formal primary, secondary and tertiary education. 27 For example, in the First Industrial Revolution, with no welfare state and only the (dire) prospect of a Victorian workhouse, employees set up Friendly Societies and Co-operatives to support colleagues falling on hard times.  With trade unions outlawed until the end of the period, it fell to the will of charitable industrialists, the likes of Robert Owen and Sir Titus Salt to improve conditions inside mills.   By the end of the Second Industrial Revolution, spurred by a more organised labour force, the Government provided welfare for its population through workplace injury compensations, basic pensions and unemployment provisions.  The interwar years ushered in universal healthcare, unemployment insurance and pensions.  By the dawn of the 3rd Revolution, individual enterprise and privatisation were ascendant.  Reform of social services – to help create a society of equal opportunity – followed, supported by increased public spending for maternity and child benefits, early years education, and provisions for pensioners. 28 The number of Friendly Societies rose to 27,000 by the end of the 1800s and Trade Union membership quadrupled from 2 million in 1889 to 8.3 million by 1920.  Spurred by industrial unrest, the state introduced the precursor to the minimum wage in the first decade of the 1900s.  Unionism has been in decline since the 1970s, with membership dipping below six million in 2012 for the first time since the 1940s. 29 Recent work indicates that trade unions in the US played an important role in supporting the wages of lower-skilled workers during the years of the 3rd Industrial Revolution, thereby helping to limit increases in inequality over this period.

First, everyone can contribute to a better understanding of the new skills that will be required.  That includes granular reviews by firms of the mismatches between their current talent pool and future needs;  estimates by the creators of general purpose technologies of the breadth of their potential applications;  and reporting by public institutions on the aggregate pace of automation and trends in the labour market.   The rate-limiting factor of technology adoption is often the skill-set of existing employees. For that reason alone, business has an enormous interest in effective workforce training.  And the providers of general-purpose technologies have a responsibility to explore how they can develop their products in ways that maximise job-creation or broader social benefits.  For example, DeepMind established an Ethics and Society Research Unit to help technologists put ethics into practice, and to help society anticipate and direct the impact of AI so that it works for the many. New labour market institutions will need to balance facilitating labour mobility and encouraging appropriate protections of workers in non-standard forms of employment that emerge in industries, as considered in the UK by the Taylor review of modern working practices.30 Other issues range from technology solutions to improve matching to news frameworks data portability (including reputational histories). Each industrial revolution has eventually been accompanied by major innovations in enabling or educational institutions.  The biggest issue may be how to institutionalise re-training in mid-career and to integrate it with the social welfare system.   The time for a quaternary system of education, founded on the same principle of universality as primary, secondary and tertiary education may eventually arrive.   There are also roles for retraining schemes, such as the UK’s Flexible Learning Fund31 and the Singapore SkillsFuture programme, which offers all its citizens aged 25 and over £250 credit to pay for approved work-skills related courses. Generous subsidies, of up to 90% for Singaporeans aged 40 and over, are available on top of this credit. According to SkillsFuture’s Chief Executive, the returns on that spending matter less than changing the mindset around continuous reskilling.  An often overlooked but nonetheless critical element of the ecosystem is to build a financial sector consistent with the new economy.                                                                  30 Available at https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/good-work-the-taylor-review-of-modern-working-practices. 31 The Government has allocated £40m through the FLF in Spring2017 budget to run pilot projects.

Innovation in, and greater connectivity across, wholesale payment systems have the potential to cut the costs of doing business across borders and unlock new trading opportunities.  Intelligent use of big financial datasets could transform credit markets, closing the gap between financing opportunities available to small companies and those enjoyed by their larger competitors. Given their position at the heart of the financial system, central banks have a crucial role to play in supporting the development of this new finance, not least through creating the new infrastructure that it will require.32 Monetary Policy’s Role in Managing the Transition  As a former central banker, Whitaker would have recognised the importance of maintaining price stability during periods of large structural change.   The appropriate setting of monetary policy will be influenced by the structural changes wrought by the Fourth Industrial Revolution, including in the labour market, by its impact on price dynamics and on the equilibrium rate of interest. To be clear, as these structural changes are real in nature, monetary policy cannot prevent them, and it would be unwise to attempt to accelerate them.  For example, running the economy hotter is unlikely to be effective at increasing the rate at which workers displaced by technology can find new roles because it does not address the underlying frictions, particularly the lack of suitable skills. However, as the structural changes take effect, they are likely to affect the balance between supply and demand, and monetary policy will need to respond accordingly. In the long run, the Fourth Industrial Revolution should substantially boost productivity and supply.  Based on past experience, the productivity of roles experiencing high levels of automation could expand at rates in excess of 5% per year, and aggregate productivity growth could increase by as much as ½ to 1½ percentage points per year.33 The increases in supply from automation and the Fourth Industrial Revolution should, in time, lead to higher demand as they flow through into higher incomes.  With job destruction running ahead of the productivity and creation effects in the shorter term, however, demand is likely to be weaker for a period.                                                                    32 For more details, see ‘New Economy, New Finance, New Bank’, speech by Mark Carney at the Mansion House, June 2018. 33 The lower estimate is based on the productivity gains realised from the introduction of steam power, while the upper estimate is based on the improvements harnessed from the ICT revolution.

     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 11  11   As Chair Powell recently reminded us, the challenge for monetary policy during periods of structural change is to take into account its potential impact on the underlying dynamics of the economy.  That is why, in the UK, the Monetary Policy Committee periodically takes stock of developments and updates its estimates of key variables such as the equilibrium rates of interest and unemployment.34 The MPC provided our assessment of the equilibrium rate of interest – the interest rate that sustains inflation at target and output at potential – in its August Inflation Report.  The equilibrium interest rate provides a way to think about the forces acting on the economy, and whether policy is stimulative or contractionary.  It is affected by shorter-term influences, such as headwinds to demand, and by slow-moving structural factors that affect the balance between the demand for capital and the stock of wealth available to finance it.  For open economies like the UK and Ireland, those factors will be heavily influenced by global developments. As the MPC noted at the time, increased automation could push the equilibrium interest rate up or down.  On the one hand, the increases in productivity that result could increase businesses’ demand for capital, pushing up the equilibrium interest rate for a period – and permanently if automation raises productivity growth.35  On the other hand, however, increases in inequality would likely shift income to those with lower propensities to consume,36 increasing the stock saving and pushing the equilibrium rate down.37   Monetary policy makers must also take into account how potential structural changes in the labour market and pricing dynamics that result from the Fourth Industrial Revolution might affect the evolution of inflationary pressures.  These considerations can be illustrated using the Phillips Curve diagram. Until the productivity and creativity effects catch up with the displacement effect, increased automation will impart disinflationary pressures through a reduction in businesses’ demand for labour relative to supply.  Even if the transition happens relatively quickly and smoothly by historic standards – taking 30 years and with a relatively quick rate of new job finding among those displaced by technology – total hours worked could be 2 per cent lower throughout, equivalent to a 2 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate or a 5 percentage point rise in the underemployment rate.38                                                                    34 The Fourth Industrial Revolution could also affect the transmission of monetary policy through its effects on the financial sector.  For example, advances in technology and data availability could lead to greater competition in the financial sector, potentially strengthening the pass-through of changes in monetary policy into the interest rates faced by households and companies. 35 If automation increases the level, but not the growth rate, of productivity, it will only raise capital relative to output temporarily.  This effect will be reinforced by an increase in the capital-output ratio during the job destruction phase, as labour is displaced by automation.  However, the upward pressure on the equilibrium interest rate will lessen as the creation effect takes hold. 36 The experience of past episodes suggests that, in the first instance, the returns from the Fourth Industrial Revolution are likely to flow more to the owners of the new capital than to the workers who use it – leading to Engels’ pause in real wages.  Owners of capital tend to be wealthier to begin with and evidence suggests that those with higher wealth have a higher propensity to save increases in income (this idea goes back to Kalecki (1954) and Marx before him).  Increases in job polarisation and skills premia, which also shift income towards the top of the distribution, are likely to add to this effect.  Globally, inequality could also increase as a result of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, which would further lower the equilibrium rate in open economies like the UK and Ireland. 37 Summers (2016) has argued that rising market concentration may also have been an important cause for the fall in the equilibrium interest rate over recent decades.  See http://larrysummers.com/2016/03/30/corporate-profits-are-near-record-highs-heres-why-thats-a-problem/.  38 Measured as the proportion of people working part-time would who prefer a full-time job. 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 12  12   This excess supply of labour available to work on non-automated tasks represents a shift along the Phillips Curve, imparting modest disinflationary pressures.  For the UK, each additional percentage point of labour market slack is estimated to reduce annual wage growth by one third of a percentage point. However, mismatches between the skills of the current workforce and those required by the new technologies or other substantial frictions to workers changing role could cause the equilibrium unemployment rate to rise alongside any increase in unemployment – particularly if the speed of adoption of new technologies is faster than in the past.  That would shift the Phillips Curve up, reducing the disinflationary effects of automation.   At present, there is little evidence to go on to judge the likely size and persistence of any increasing in structural unemployment.  Monetary policy makers will need to remain alert to this possibility, updating their assessment as the transition occurs.  The experience of the 1970s shows that mistakenly ascribing a structural pickup in unemployment to cyclical factors can lead to the wrong macroeconomic policy setting, with long-lasting adverse effects.   A more automated world could also affect inflationary pressures through flattening the Phillips curve.  The threat of robot substitutes could weaken workers’ bargaining power.  And advances in artificial intelligence and similar technologies could increase companies’ ability to learn about their competitors’ marginal costs and leading to greater synchronisation of price changes across companies.  Already, there is evidence that online retailers adjust prices more frequently than those on the high street, while being less likely to vary prices by location.39 Conclusion While the Fourth Industrial Revolution has the potential to transform the economy, the challenges it presents for monetary policy makers are in many ways not new.   In recent years, the MPC has increasingly focused on structural changes in the economy, including by instituting regular reviews and publishing our assessment of the most important variables, such as the equilibrium unemployment rate.   Over this period, as unemployment has fallen towards its estimated equilibrium rate and companies have found it harder to recruit and retain staff, pay growth has picked up.  Across the economy as a whole, growth in average wages excluding bonuses has risen from around 1¾% a year during 2010-15 to around 2½% in 2016, and wage growth is expected to have picked up a little further to around 2¾% around the middle of this year.  The most recent outturns support that judgement, with whole economy total pay increasing by 2.9% in the three months to July and private sector regular pay up 3% over the same period, and domestically generated inflation at rates consistent with the 2% inflation target.                                                                    39 Cavallo, A (2018), ‘More Amazon Effects:  Online Competition and Pricing Behaviors’, paper prepared for the 2018 Jackson Hole Symposium.

Although current rates of pay growth in the UK are below pre-crisis averages, this largely reflects continued weakness in productivity growth.  While that weakness may reflect the early consequences of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, other factors seem more likely to be at play.  In the years following the global financial crisis, the aftereffects of that shock and the subsequent euro-area crisis exerted a drag on business investment.  More recently, uncertainty around Brexit has had an additional dampening effect. As has been the case for some time, developments regarding the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union are the most significant influences on the economic outlook.  And while the impact of the Fourth Industrial Revolution may be felt over the coming decades, some of the Brexit effects on supply may be much more immediate. The Bank of England is well-prepared for whatever path the economy takes, including a wide range of potential Brexit outcomes.  We have used our stress test to ensure that the largest UK banks can continue to meet the needs of UK households and businesses even through a disorderly Brexit, however unlikely that may be.  Our job, after all, is not to hope for the best but to plan for the worst.  The MPC will respond to any persistent change in the outlook to bring inflation sustainably back to 2% target while doing what it can to support jobs and activity.  The appropriate policy response is not automatic and will depend on the balance of the effects on demand, supply, and the exchange rate. Whitaker’s life work reminds us that achieving lasting economic prosperity requires us to be bold and to adapt.  To do so, we need to have the right institutions in place, so that everyone can share in the gains.  Such adaptability will be particularly important as both our economies embark on a new era of technological change and new degrees of openness.  
Ravi Menon: Emerging Asia - short-term outlook and risksPointers for panel remarks by Mr Ravi Menon, Managing Director of the Monetary Authority ofSingapore, at the 5th Milken Institute Asia Summit, Singapore, 13 September 2018.*   *   *Global growth has shown remarkable resilience despite mounting uncertainties.Growth this year is likely to be as strong as last year’s.  And last year’s growth was thestrongest since the global financial crisis.And Emerging Asian economies have been doing well.But the going will get tougher in the months ahead and going into 2019. Some slowdown in momentum is to be expected, following 12–18 months of strong growthWhat bears close watching are two headwinds emanating from the US and sweepingacross the world, including Emerging Asia.The first headwind is rising trade tensions. The second is tightening global financial conditions.First, growing trade disputes. The impact of the trade tariffs announced to-date has been limited. If the threats of further tariffs are carried out, trade volumes will come down and somereduction in growth is to be expected – the US by about 0.5% points and China by about thesame amount.This will have implications down the supply chain and production networks across EmergingAsia, shaving off growth in most economies.2019 will most likely not be as good a year as 2018. But the effects will not be devastating – we are not looking at a recession.This is not a global trade conflict.  This is centred on the US.The US is of course the biggest export market in the world but total US imports account foronly 3% of global GDP.Many other countries – especially in Emerging Asia – are trading among themselves withouta nexus to the US.These trading linkages will grow over time as demand in these economies grows with arising middle class, urbanisation, and investment in infrastructure.All the same, a prolonged period of trade tensions is not good for the global economy.The more serious casualty is perhaps not trade but investment.  Corporates may scale backinvestment amidst uncertainty.This will reduce the productive capacity for future growth, delay technological upgrading, andcompromise productivity growth.This is why the best response to unilateral trade restrictions is to push ahead with further tradeliberalisation among other willing parties instead of retaliation and escalation.If countries do not retaliate against tariffs imposed by the US, the cost to their own 1 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
economies is likely to be contained.And a mutually damaging trade war would be averted.And this is what Emerging Asia is doing – liberalising trade within the region and with others.TPP-11 or Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership(CPTPP)This will reduce barriers across economies with a GDP of US$10 trillion, roughly 13.5%of the world economy.It is expected to be ratified early next year.  And five to six more countries haveexpressed interest in joining the CPTPP.ASEAN+6 or Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP)This FTA builds on the existing five ASEAN Plus One FTAs.Negotiations have been going on for some time but the pace has picked up recently asrising trade tensions have underscored the importance of enhancing economicintegration to build resilienceWhen it is signed, RCEP will be the world’s largest trading bloc in terms of population,covering nearly 3.5 billion people, and accounting for a third of the world’s GDP.Second headwind – tightening global financial conditions.As the Fed continues to raise interest rates and unwind its balance sheet, global liquidityconditions will tighten and financial market valuations will come under further pressure.Asset revaluations will be keenly felt in EMEs, which have benefited from large investorinflows driven in part by investors’ search-for-yield in the post-GFC period.In Emerging Asia, some economies will face higher financing costs, rising external debt burdens,short-term capital outflows, and heightened currency volatility.We have already seen some signs of these pressures.They are to be expected – as part of the normal adjustment to the normalisation of globalfinancial conditions.ASEAN is well placed to deal with these pressures as well as contagion effects from EMEs inother parts of the worldFirst, economic fundamentals in ASEAN are stronger.Growth is good – it is close to or above potential across the ASEAN-4 (Malaysia, Indonesia,Thailand, Philippines).Inflation has been subdued.Current accounts are in surplus or only a small deficit.Buffers to withstand shocks are strong – be it central banks’ reserves or banks’ capitaladequacy.Second, ASEAN policymakers have demonstrated that they are able and willing to adjust policiesto deal with external and internal stresses.They have raised interest rates pre-emptively.They have allowed their exchange rates to depreciate in an orderly manner, intervening inthe FX markets only to moderate excessive movements. 2 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
And they have room to use fiscal policy to support growth, as debt positions are generallyhealthy.Take Indonesia for example. The currency has come under some pressure but themacroeconomic fundamentals are essentially sound.The economy is growing at a respectable 5%.Inflation is under control, at about 3.5% – an achievement compared to the past.The fiscal deficit has come down and is now about 2% of GDP – not an alarming number.  Total debt-to-GDP ratio is 30% – a respectable number by any international comparison. The current account deficit has slipped somewhat but, at 3% of GDP, is not unduly large.  And it is not unusual for a developing country to run a current account deficit to financeinvestment for future growth.And Indonesia’s policy responses to-date have demonstrated a willingness to take toughmeasures to build up resilienceThe central bank has hiked interest rates.The government has been re-evaluating import-intensive infrastructure spending.Markets can sometimes over-react and investors sell down EME assets in a general knee-jerkrisk-off mood. But as investors understand better that Emerging Asian economies are on a strong footing,they are becoming more discerning. And contagion effects from other EMEs will then reduce over time.More importantly, the ASEAN growth story remains intact.ASEAN is poised for continued healthy growth over the medium term, on the back ofmacroeconomic stability.The ASEAN-5 economies – Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand and Singapore– areexpected to grow at close to 5% per annum over the next 5 years.This is higher compared to Latin America (2.8%) and Eastern Europe (3.3%).ASEAN’s resilience stems from fundamental drivers that support the region’s growth in amutually reinforcing fashionRising Middle Class:  Rising affluence of the middle class will spur consumption, including arange of modern services – especially finance and insurance, professional services,tourism, healthcare and education. Urbanisation: Rural-urban migration and the expansion of cities will spur sizeable demandfor infrastructure. Integration: ASEAN’s growing integration – increasingly powered by technology and e-commerce – will allow the region to reap complementarities and synergies to sustain growthover the long term.The ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) Blueprint 2025 lays the pathway for a highly integratedregion, well connected to other parts of a dynamic Asia.  More than short-term volatilities,ASEAN’s prospects will depend on how well it executes closer integration and structural reformsto increase efficiency and productivity. 3 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
Jens Weidmann: Higher growth, lower inflation? - Digitalisation froma central bank's perspectiveSpeech by Dr Jens Weidmann, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank and Chairman of theBoard of Directors of the Bank for International Settlements, at the reception hosted by theDeutsche Bundesbank at the annual meeting of the German Economic Association (Verein fürSocialpolitik), Freiburg im Breisgau, 3 September 2018.*   *   *1 WelcomeLadies and gentlemen,On behalf of the Deutsche Bundesbank, I would like to welcome you to this reception here at theKonzerthaus in Freiburg.It gives me great pleasure to be here with you today. But I am particularly pleased that you are allhere. By that I mean physically in person and not virtually. At the Bundesbank, but also in thefields of research and education, I’m sure, events like these are increasingly shifting from the realworld to the virtual world. Presentations are being streamed live on the internet, andconversations are taking place via chat. This eliminates costly and time-consuming travel.But despite all the technological advances, buffets, refreshments and social gatherings cannotbe transmitted digitally, not yet anyway. And for most of us, real life is usually the more enjoyableoption. It would be a shame if we had to forego the pleasure this evening.But digital technologies have become ubiquitous. They now have a major influence on how welive and work. Most of you in this room are carrying a triumph of this development with you today:the mobile phone.You could, however, argue that making phone calls whilst on the move is not particularlyrevolutionary. As early as 1958, the first analogue mobile telecommunication network was set upin Germany. To begin with, however, the bulky telephone devices weighed an impressive 36kilos, which is why they were only found in cars. It was only possible to make calls whilst actuallydriving, because the telephones consumed an enormous amount of electricity. A battery capableof lasting several hours or even days was completely unimaginable.Over time, the devices became smaller and lighter, until the first “mobile phones” came onto themarket in the early 1980s. But despite all the technological advances, these analogue telephonesare still essentially what they have always been: devices for making phone calls.It was only in the course of digitalisation that mobile phones were transformed into mini-computers and thus into the clever all-rounders we could no longer do without in our everydaylife. Today, smartphones also double up as cameras, navigation systems, game consoles,diaries, address books, pocket calculators and much more, all on one single device.Although we cannot yet fly to the moon using our mobile phones, smartphones do, however,contain a memory chip which is several hundred thousand times larger than that used in thecomputer on board the Apollo 11 mission, which was sufficient to take the first human beings tothe moon back in 1969.This increase in the number of functions has also led to rapid growth in their distribution: thereare now more mobile phones in the world than people. And yet the success story of thesmartphone is just one example of the transformative power of digitalisation. Let's just look at theway we communicate with each other, keep ourselves informed or do our shopping today: so 1 / 8BIS central bankers' speeches
much has changed in recent years that it would be easier to list what has actually stayed thesame.The increasing use of digital technologies is also taking companies and employees into a new,digital age. These developments are the focus of this year's conference.From a central bank’s perspective, the change process raises the question of the overalleconomic implications. In other words, what does the digital revolution mean for growth,employment and price developments? I would like to take a closer look at these aspects with youtoday.2 Impact on productivity“Productivity isn’t everything, but in the long run it is almost everything.” This quote by PaulKrugman emphasised the fact that a higher standard of living in the long term hinges on aneconomy's ability to boost its productivity. And this is where technological progress throughdigitalisation comes into play.This initially involves companies in the digital economy, such as manufacturers oftelecommunications technology, software developers or service providers in the IT sector.Labour productivity is growing much faster in this sector than in the economy as a whole.Although the share of these companies in terms of total value added is still rather small inGermany, this sector does make a significant contribution to overall economic productivitygrowth: since the mid-1990s, it has averaged a quarter of a percentage point per year. In othereconomies, such as in Sweden, Finland and some industrialised countries outside Europe, thecontribution was significantly higher.Digital technologies are also breaking into other industries and changing products and processesthere, too. We have noticed something astonishing here since the mid-2000s, namely thatproductivity growth has weakened.This has led some to speak of a new paradox of productivity. New, because we already observeda similar development back in the 1970s and 1980s. “You can see the computer age everywherebut in the productivity statistics,” noted economist Robert Solow back then.How can this paradox be explained? Apart from possible measurement errors, the explanatoryapproaches can be roughly assigned to two camps:The pessimists, especially Bob Gordon, generally view digitalisation as being less transformativethan assumed. Digital technologies offer less potential for major productivity gains than previouswaves of innovation, which were driven, for example, by the development of the steam engine orelectrification.In the other camp, the optimists, such as Erik Brynjolfsson, put forward the argument of time-lagged effects. General-purpose technologies in particular, such as robotics or artificialintelligence, require additional innovations and investments for use in everyday business life. Ittakes time for new technologies to spread, to be integrated into production processes and to takefull effect. Accordingly, the essential productivity gains have yet to come, he claims.Regardless of who is right in the end, it is clear that companies can only exploit the potential thatdigitalisation brings with it if the necessary framework conditions are in place. For example, manydigital technologies require access to a fast internet connection.And Germany is lagging behind other industrialised countries in this respect. Last year, themaximum connection speed in Germany was 65 megabits per second on average. In Spain it12345 2 / 8BIS central bankers' speeches
was no less than 85 megabits, and in Korea it was as high as 120 megabits.In particular, the expansion of the fibre optic network is making only slow progress here inGermany. Just two per cent of broadband connections are based primarily on fibre optic linesand thus on the technology that makes particularly fast internet connections possible. Bycontrast, the OECD average is 26 per cent.This makes it all the more important for Germany to forge ahead and vigorously expand its digitalinfrastructure.3 Impact on employmentLadies and gentlemen,One issue that is worrying many people is how digitalisation will transform the workplace. Self-driving robo-taxis and parcel-delivering drones still aren’t a feature of our day-to-day lives. Butthere is no denying that digital technologies are making ever greater inroads into worlds that werelong thought to be the reserve of human beings.Nowadays, robots help doctors and carers; they crawl through narrow tunnels and shafts so thatwe don’t have to; they mow the lawn, and they explore outer space and the oceans. Algorithmsmake investment decisions in a fraction of a second, and many a sports report these days iswritten by a robo-reporter.As we venture into an era of automation, a witticism attributed to the economist Warren Bennissprings to mind, and I quote: “The factory of the future will have only two employees, a man and adog. The man will be there to feed the dog. The dog will be there to keep the man from touchingthe equipment.”We haven’t quite reached that point yet. But looking at some professions, one does wonderwhether they will still be around in the medium term. The OECD estimates that nearly one in tenoccupations could be automatable over the next few years.That said, there’s one thing we shouldn’t lose sight of. History books are full of occupations thatdon’t exist any more. Or is there anyone here who still knows a copperplate engraver, a rag-and-bone man, a cooper or a wheelwright?So being scared of losing one’s job and resisting innovation were commonplace in earlier timesof upheaval as well. Just take the protests launched by the Luddites in the 19th century. To thisday, you will still find a four-liner – on the internet, of course – which goes like this: “Who got theidea of steam into their head? / It cost the waggoners their daily bread / They truly are in a badway / Because of that damned railway!”While there is no doubt that the railway cost many coachmen, cartwrights and wheelwrights theirjobs, it did create brand new type of jobs: track layers, train drivers and guards, to name butthree.We haven't run out of work yet. And digitalisation will also forge new professions. Social mediamanagers, robotics engineers and drone pilots are just three I could mention here.So you could say the new technologies can potentially unleash both creative and destructiveenergy – much like the “creative destruction” coined by Joseph Schumpeter. At present, onecould argue that the job losses are being compensated for by new ones. At the same time, ashift is under way in employment prospects and relative wages.Many routine activities will probably feel the pressure of automation particularly intensely. These567 3 / 8BIS central bankers' speeches
are areas where salaries may well feel the squeeze. Then again, there are other activities whichappear to be benefiting from automation. Taken in isolation, this can lead to greater inequality inthe distribution of income.In this regard, digitalisation is having an impact much like that of globalisation, and it is presentingsimilar policy challenges as well. But the effect of digitalisation goes deeper still – it istransforming many job profiles and, as a result, the requirements which employees are expectedto meet. Demand is on the increase for skillsets which a computer cannot replace: social skillsand creativity, and also the ability to operate ever-evolving technologies.If society is to come to terms with structural change, people need to be in a position to harnessthe opportunities which digitalisation presents. And education is the key to unlocking thispotential.But education should not be misconstrued as a phenomenon that is confined to the first third ofour lives and is then over and done with. Quite the opposite: we need to make learning a firmfixture in our professional lives. And we need to establish a culture of lifelong learning. That iswhy I think what really counts is making sure that every employee has access to continuousprofessional development.Of course, education needs to start much, much earlier in our lives: none of us were borndigitised – not even the digital natives, as they are known.Needless to say, children nowadays naturally adopt new technologies through play. You mayhave seen one of those online videos where a small child is standing in front of an aquarium andputs his thumb and forefinger on the glass in an attempt to zoom in and make the fish bigger.But in tomorrow’s workplace, being able to operate a smartphone won’t be enough. That is whywe need digital education to give young people a firm technical grounding and strengthen theirmedia skills.This is another area where action needs to be taken. The International Computer and InformationLiteracy Study (ICILS) found that German schoolchildren have average skills, if that. Theauthors found that as few as one-third of teachers use computers regularly (i.e. at least once aweek) during lessons. In this particular category, Germany actually brings up the rear among thecountries surveyed.Swiss economist Thomas Straubhaar also highlighted the fundamental importance of educationin the digital age in a recent op-ed piece he wrote for a German daily newspaper: “A goodeducation system may be expensive,” he conceded, but in the long run, he continued, one thingis even costlier, and that’s a bad education system.4 Impact on inflationLadies and gentlemen,As a central bank, we are interested in more than just the ramifications of digitalisation for thereal economy. Another aspect, and one that is of particular importance, is its impact on pricedevelopments – keeping prices stable is, after all, our primary objective as monetarypolicymakers.Digital transformation impacts on inflation through multiple channels.One of them is the way technological progress pushes up productivity, driving down productioncosts. Prices ought to follow costs downwards, assuming there is sufficient competition.8910 4 / 8BIS central bankers' speeches
Another is the shift in sales channels. It is becoming increasingly common to buy goods onlinerather in the local shop. As recently as in the year 2000, online trade accounted for a near-invisible 0.3% of retail sales. By last year, that figure had already climbed to just under 10%.This can invigorate competition – after all, online marketplaces are where you will find providersfrom every corner of the world. At the same time, price comparison websites let consumersscan the entire market in just a matter of clicks, creating very high levels of price transparency.Even if there are some who only look for information online and still end up shopping locally, theincreased transparency nonetheless intensifies the competition and squeezes margins andprices. My US counterpart Jerome Powell spoke in his testimony to the Senate BankingCommittee about the “Amazon effect story”. A study by the ECB concludes that the increasinguse of online trade in the EU has reduced non-energy industrial goods inflation by 0.1 of apercentage point each year since 2003.There is another phenomenon which could have the opposite effect: the rise of dominant“superstar firms”.For the most part, these firms offer information-based goods which are sold online. It is abusiness model that involves substantial fixed costs but barely any variable costs. Just take thevideo-on-demand platforms – whether they have a large or a small customer base has littlebearing on their overall costs.Increasing returns to scale are also being generated in the social media or by peer-to-peerridesharing or accommodation platforms, to name but two. Market leaders benefit from thenetwork effect as well. The more active users a product has, the more attractive it becomes forothers.That is why some companies often emerge as winners as time progresses. They can thencapitalise on the market power they gain to push up their prices and margins. To quote the title ofa famous song by ABBA, “The Winner Takes It All”, but do please forgive me for not breaking outin song.Jan De Loecker and Jan Eeckhout estimate that the general rise in firms’ price mark-ups in theUnited States increased the inflation rate by roughly one percentage point a year between 1980and 2014. That said, digitalisation is just one potential factor driving the rise in market power.The bottom-line impact on inflation of the contrary effects of digitalisation cannot yet be quantifiedwith any real certainty. According to the Bank of Canada, the research findings so far indicatethat digitalisation can have a small dampening effect on inflation. Sweden’s Riksbank,however, argues that the decline in the rate of inflation observed in Sweden in recent years isprimarily connected with other factors.Another area where digitalisation is making itself felt is in the measurement of inflation.In the online trade – and increasingly in the bricks-and-mortar retail world, too – prices can bealtered at the push of a button. The job of changing one price tag for another is a thing of thepast. This pricing mechanism, which is mainly deployed by big businesses, uses algorithms thatrespond to demand and change prices dynamically.It’s a phenomenon you might have noticed when you book a flight online – ticket prices varystrongly depending on how full the aircraft is and what time you make your booking.In a paper prepared for the recent symposium of central bankers in Jackson Hole, AlbertoCavallo stressed that online competition is transforming pricing behaviour, writing that both thefrequency of price changes and the degree of uniform pricing have increased. But for11121314151617 5 / 8BIS central bankers' speeches
statisticians, prices that change frequently and fluctuate strongly are something of a challenge.These days, it’s not enough to survey the price of a product once a month. So digitalisation ismaking it more difficult to measure inflation.But on the other hand, digitalisation opens up new opportunities as well. Web scraping – astatistical method to automatically capture online prices – is just one example I could mentionhere. Alberto Cavallo and Roberto Rigobon are already using web scraping to collect hugeamounts of online data as part of their Billion Prices Project in order to prepare daily priceindices, which have interesting leading indicator properties.5 Potential implications for monetary policyLadies and gentlemen,One thing is clear: digitalisation has many faces. Some of those faces we’ve already becomefamiliar with, some we’re just getting to know and others we can only guess at for now. Therecan be no doubting its potential to influence productivity, employment and inflation. But what doesit all mean for monetary policy?There is a lot of talk about monetary policymakers’ capacity for effective intervention. Thefinancial crisis saw central banks take their interest rate policy to the limits, with barely any roomto bring policy rates lower.When it comes to interest rates, the lower bound is like the perimeter lines of a football pitch,which set the boundaries of the playing area and players’ room for manoeuvre. The importanceof room for manoeuvre is something that Oscar Wilde recognised back in his day: “In modern lifemargin is everything,” he has one of his characters proclaim in the play “Lady Windermere’sFan”.And we may well see room for monetary policy manoeuvre shrink in future. If digitalisation wereto dampen inflation over a prolonged period of time, nominal interest rates would fall, narrowingthe gap to the lower bound. This increases the likelihood – all else being equal – of monetarypolicymakers having to resort to non-standard measures to remain capable of effectiveintervention.From what we have seen so far, though, it looks like the inflation-dampening effect ofdigitalisation is fairly minor. It is also worth bearing in mind that the effects of reduced costs andincreased competition stem from an adjustment process. In the new long-term equilibrium state,potential for price cuts would already have been exhausted and the impact on inflation wouldhave ceased.However, the reverse is also conceivable. If digitalisation brings increases in productivity andpotential growth, the natural rate of interest will rise. This would push up nominal interest rates,giving conventional monetary policy more room to play with.The fact that capacity for effective action has become such a key issue for monetary policy in thefirst place actually has nothing to do with digitalisation. It has more to do with the low inflation andthe low interest rates of recent years, both of which are, first and foremost, after-effects of thefinancial and economic crisis.Nevertheless, some observers already think that this could be the new normal. They areconcerned that central banks are coming up against the lower bound with their policy rates moreand more frequently and are having to turn to non-standard instruments. That’s why someeconomists propose aiming for a higher rate of inflation, anticipating that this would provide agreater safety margin to the interest rate floor.18 6 / 8BIS central bankers' speeches
But there are side-effects and risks associated with raising the target inflation rate, somethingwhich the Bundesbank highlighted at length in its June Monthly Report this year.At this point, let's bear in mind the vital importance of firmly anchored inflation expectations foreffective monetary policy. Putting up the inflation target causes inflation expectations to shift. Butthere is absolutely no guarantee that they will quickly fall into line with and remain anchored at thenew target rate.Ben Bernanke once put it like this: “If we were to go to 4% and say we’re going to 4%, we wouldrisk a lot of … hard-won credibility, because folks would say, well, if we go to 4%, why not go to6%? It’d be very difficult to tie down expectations at 4%.”This is why I am convinced that we should continue aiming for inflation of below, but close to, 2%over the medium term and not arouse any doubts as to our credibility as monetary policymakers.In any case, with regard to the natural interest rate and the long-term outlook, a growth-promotingeconomic policy and structural reforms are the right way to go.And we can set about this at both the national and the European level. It is particularly crucial, forinstance, that we harness the possibilities offered by digitalisation, by improving educationalopportunities, expanding the digital infrastructure, bolstering cyber security and modernising thelegal framework. The time has come for Europe to finally complete the digital single market.A higher growth path leads to a higher general interest rate level, which would give monetarypolicy more water under its keel again.6 ConclusionLadies and gentlemen,“Computers are useless. They can only give you answers.” Pablo Picasso is supposed to havesaid that, over half a century ago.And with that, he joins the ranks of famous inaccurate predictions – in some ways. For there is agrain of truth in those words. Wherever things hinge, in particular, on asking the right questions,in the world of research for example, computers are – as yet – just a tool. They cannot replacehumans in those areas.But digitalisation is shaking things up. We will wait with bated breath to see what computers andartificial intelligence can do in the future.A newspaper recently ran a story about the Swiss bank UBS having created a virtual clone of itschief economist. The idea is for his digital likeness to advise wealthy clients on their investmentsin future. Evidently, we economists are not immune to being replaced by computers either.Thank you for your attention.Krugman, P.

I would like to thank Claudia Godbout, Harriet Jackson and Eric Santor  for their help in preparing this speech.  Not for publication before September 6, 2018 14:30 Eastern Time      Remarks by Carolyn A. Wilkins Senior Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada                Saskatchewan Trade & Export Partnership                        Regina, Saskatchewan  September 6, 2018  An Update on Canada’s  Economic Resilience  Introduction It is great to visit Regina during the waning days of summer. I would like to thank Chris Dekker of the Saskatchewan Trade & Export Partnership for the invitation to give an update on Canada’s economic performance, and discuss the Bank of Canada’s interest-rate announcement yesterday. The big picture over the summer has been that the global economy is doing well, despite some troubling developments on the trade front. Many countries around the world are continuing to grow and put people back to work. Here in Canada the economy has shown its resilience, operating near capacity for the past year—the first time that has happened since the global financial crisis.  Next week marks 10 years since Lehman Brothers failed; and, after many fits and starts, this period of sustained growth seems like it has been a long time coming. Since the crisis, people in Saskatchewan have also been forced to deal with the consequences of the plunge in oil prices that started in 2014, and lower prices for many other commodities. The Saskatchewan economy returned to growth last year, and it is good to see the expansion here is continuing.  The Canadian economy is now on a solid footing, although we are feeling some headwinds from the trade environment. The recent US tariffs on steel and aluminum mean losses on both sides of the border. Trade disputes between the United States and China are affecting Canadian commodity producers too. And uncertainty about the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) means a number of businesses are wary of making investments in capacity that would help them take advantage of improved global demand. I know that these issues are top of mind for many here today. For any business, facing the challenges that come with uncertainty is crucial.  
-2 - Farming in Saskatchewan is now an impressively high-tech business. Yet, to succeed, business leaders in this sector still need to deal with the vagaries of Mother Nature and global commodity prices. Decisions must still be taken and followed through on.   It is surprisingly similar for the Bank of Canada’s Governing Council. We have some finely honed economic models to guide us, yet we must take decisions about the policy interest rate amid many unknowns to meet our inflation objective. We also must follow through by communicating with Canadians and with financial markets about our outlook for the economy and inflation.  With that in mind, my remarks today will cover three points: First, how the Canadian economy has evolved since our quarterly Monetary Policy Report (MPR) in July; next, how we have factored developments on the trade side into our outlook; and, finally, I will give you a sense of Governing Council’s deliberations that led to our decision yesterday to hold our policy rate steady.  Recent economic developments When it comes to economic developments, Canada has been thrown several curve balls over the past decade: the financial crisis; lower commodity prices; and now, trade tensions. It was only a little over a year ago that we could see that the adjustment to lower oil prices was sufficiently behind us to begin withdrawing the monetary stimulus we had put in place in 2015. We have raised the policy rate four times since July 2017, to 1 1/2 per cent. During this period, overall Canadian economic performance has been solid and broad-based. Growth has been running close to potential, the rate at which the economy can grow on a sustained basis without sparking too much inflation. And core inflation measures are now around 2 per cent. Today, the policy rate is still relatively low—by that I mean that it is lower than what we would consider to be a “neutral” rate of interest.1 The data and other information we have received since July reaffirm Governing Council’s view that higher interest rates will be required to achieve our inflation target.  In fact, the global economy is performing largely as we expected, and that is a good thing because it will support growth here at home. Our neighbour to the south has seen particularly strong demand, driven by household and business spending. Some jurisdictions, though, are showing signs of weaker momentum, which may be partly linked to trade measures and uncertainty about trade policy. Meanwhile, the most recent data for Canada indicate that growth should average near potential over the next couple of years.  Some of you might recall that in our July forecast we were counting on a quick rebound from the marked slowdown in gross domestic product (GDP) growth that we saw during the first quarter of this year. This was an important call because it 1 The Bank estimates that the neutral rate of interest (nominal) is between 2.5 and 3.5 per cent. For more details, see X. S. Chen and J. Dorich, “The Neutral Rate in Canada: 2018 Estimates,” Bank of Canada Staff Analytical Note No. 2018-22 (July 2018).
 - 3 - lent support to our view that July was the right time to raise interest rates by  25 basis points.  The GDP data released last week by Statistics Canada show that we were right on the money; the economy grew at an annual pace of 2.9 per cent between April and June, twice the pace we saw earlier this year. Growth was fuelled by consumption and exports and, to a lesser extent, business investment and government spending.2 The data support our view that the shift in demand toward exports and investment is continuing. Healthy growth in consumption and home renovations also indicates that households are generally adjusting well to higher interest rates.3 A wide range of sectors are contributing to these developments. The resource sector continues to expand after a few tough years. The services sector is also growing in many high value-added areas. For example, in the second quarter computer system design and related services grew more than 10 per cent from a year earlier.  We expect the quarterly profile of GDP growth to be volatile for the rest of 2018, but to still average around 2 per cent. Temporary factors that pushed up exports in the second quarter are expected to unwind, and there have been some outages in the oil sector. Those factors will likely weigh on growth in the third quarter, but do not point to weaker underlying momentum. All of this is encouraging. And we are making progress in understanding some of the issues that have been on our minds for a while.   The first relates to the housing market and household debt, and how they are responding to a wide range of policy changes. These include the tighter guidelines for mortgage financing that came into effect in January, some provincial measures to target specific housing markets and, of course, higher interest rates over the past year.4  We saw resale activity in the housing market slow markedly at the beginning of 2018, particularly in the greater Toronto and Vancouver areas. This swing was amplified by the fact that many households had rushed to secure their financing and complete transactions ahead of the new rules coming into effect. Recent data show that in Toronto resales are rebounding and prices are stabilizing too,                                             2 Business investment growth slowed from the first quarter, as investments in machinery and equipment and in intellectual property products returned to more normal rates after recording double-digit growth earlier in the year. 3 See Box 3 of the July MPR for an assessment of how increases in interest rates will affect people who will need to renew their mortgages over the next couple of years. 4 On January 1, 2018, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) introduced the revised “Guideline B-20.” The guideline imposes a more stringent stress test on borrowers seeking new uninsured mortgages by stipulating that lenders should require such households to demonstrate that they could still service their debt at a higher interest rate. In terms of provincial measures, the “Homes for B.C.” plan included an expanded foreign buyer tax as well as additional tax and transparency measures.   
 - 4 - although in Vancouver activity and price growth remain subdued. Other urban markets that had weakened, such as Regina and Saskatoon, have steadied or shown some recovery.  So, on a national basis, sales and prices appear to be stabilizing.  This suggests that borrowers and lenders are adjusting to the range of policy changes as anticipated, and that financial vulnerabilities are beginning to ease. Growth in household credit has slowed, and the household debt-to-income ratio is edging lower. We see an improvement in the quality of new uninsured mortgages, resulting in a smaller proportion of these households becoming highly indebted.5 What I mean by highly indebted is households with loan-to-income ratios above 450 per cent. These are early positive signs, and we will have an even better view of developments as the data come in.  A second issue that we are always working to better understand relates to developments on the inflation front. The companies that participated in our Business Outlook Survey (BOS) during the second quarter told us that capacity pressures and labour shortages were intensifying. Yet, wages were rising less quickly than we would expect in an economy that is near capacity. The latest data indicate that this is still the case: Our preferred measure of wage gains was up by just under 2 ½ per cent in the second quarter.  That said, inflation data for July surprised us on the upside by coming in at 3 per cent. We had expected that inflation would average around 2 ½ per cent in the third and fourth quarters, rising toward the upper end of our target range because of temporary factors such as gasoline prices, rather than pressure from excess demand.6 Since much of the July surprise was due to a jump in the airfare component of the consumer price index (CPI), we continue to hold this view. Here is where our measures of core inflation are particularly valuable as operational guides, because they strip out a lot of the noise. Those measures have remained around 2 per cent, supporting our assessment that the inflation increase will be temporary.  Factoring the trade policy environment into the outlook Let me turn now to the final issue—the trade environment—which has been top of mind for some time given its importance to economic prospects here at home and abroad. And, while Canadian officials have been working hard to resolve the issues, a lot of uncertainty remains.  Canadian businesses are telling us that trade tensions are among several factors keeping them from investing in new capacity, even though both demand and investment intentions are strong in many sectors. Here in Saskatchewan, we have spoken with firms whose investment plans are in flux pending more clarity                                             5 Mortgages in Canada with a loan-to-value ratio of 80 per cent or below do not require government-guaranteed mortgage default insurance.  6 Other temporary factors pushing inflation above 2 per cent are the effects of minimum-wage increases and exchange rate pass-through. 
 - 5 - about NAFTA. Others are exploring whether to invest across the border instead of in Canada. These kinds of responses to uncertainty are not adequately captured by our economic models, so we need to apply judgment. This judgment is informed by our quarterly BOS, as well as by other discussions we have with business people across Canada. Canada is not alone in this—we expect that investment in many other jurisdictions is suffering from similar effects.  To assess the impact of the tariffs that have been announced, we followed two steps. The first step was to look at the potential long-term effects of the recent tariff changes. We used a new model developed by staff that is described in a staff analytical note published this morning.7 It provides an excellent framework for mapping how trade flows might change and how resources might shift across sectors over a long period of time. The second step was to consider the shorter-term effects—what might happen as businesses and workers adjust over the transition period. This is a process that is too complex for models to fully capture, yet is important to understand for monetary policy. Of course, we also accounted for the effects of countermeasures implemented by the Canadian government.  Taken together, the Bank estimates that the combination of reduced confidence and trade measures already taken will shave about two-thirds of 1 per cent from GDP in Canada by 2020.8  We are seeing the effects already. June trade data showed steel exports fell the most since 2008, with little movement in July. Moreover, the value of consumer goods subject to a 10-per cent import tariff fell almost 23 per cent in July, following a run-up in the previous months.  Regarding inflation, we estimated that Canada’s countermeasures would temporarily boost inflation by about 0.1 percentage point until the third quarter of 2019. The most recent inflation report from Statistics Canada showed no impact from the tariffs on prices to date. Still, some beer and pop manufacturers have announced plans to raise prices in response to the rising cost of aluminum cans.  The outlook for growth and inflation in Canada is also affected by tariff disputes between big players such as the United States and China. These disputes can cause shifts in global markets that affect the prices of many of the commodities we produce. Reflecting this, the prices of base metals and some agricultural products have softened. Saskatchewan was among the provinces to experience this effect earlier in the summer.  It is important to recognize that the challenges facing Canadian exporters are not only about NAFTA and tariffs. Concerns about weak business investment, firms                                             7 See K. Charbonneau and A. Landry, “Estimating the Impacts of Tariff Changes: Two Illustrative Scenarios,” Bank of Canada Staff Analytical Note No. 2018-29 (September 2018). 8 This estimate includes the impact of tariffs previously imposed by the United States on Canadian softwood lumber and newsprint as well as the new tariffs on steel and aluminum. Table 4 of the July MPR provides details on these tariffs. Although the US International Trade Commission recently overturned the newsprint tariffs, this is not expected to meaningfully change the estimate from the July MPR.     
 - 6 - building new capacity outside our borders, and declining market shares existed long before the current trade tensions emerged. Competitiveness issues have been hampering Canadian businesses for some time, even while foreign demand has been growing.  Market share in the United States for Canada’s non-energy goods has, in fact, been declining over the past 15 years.9 The effect has been particularly acute in the manufacturing sector. This trend has meant a much lower share of employment for most manufacturing industries, including automotive and parts and clothing. Regardless of what transpires on the trade policy front, the Bank will still need to better understand the competitiveness issues to assess the extent to which Canada has permanently lost market share and export capacity.10   Yesterday’s decision Let me now turn to Governing Council’s policy deliberations that led to yesterday’s decision. It will not surprise you to hear that the implications of the current trade environment were front and centre. As I just outlined, we have already incorporated into our forecast the expected negative effects of uncertainty on business investment and exports, as well as the effects of US tariffs and Canadian countermeasures imposed so far. These estimates are highly uncertain and may need to be adjusted as we get more information about the NAFTA negotiations and how businesses are adjusting their plans. Our practice is to not incorporate scenarios that have yet to occur, even though they may be the subject of ongoing discussions. That said, the risks to growth related to trade policies are not just on the downside, particularly in light of the ongoing negotiations. There is some significant upside as well.  Nonetheless, it is important to understand that certain trade developments can result in complex trade-offs for monetary policy.  On the one hand, protectionist measures can be costly in terms of growth and incomes, particularly as businesses and people adjust. A recent study by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) shows how virtually all regions in Canada, Mexico and the United States could expect lower real wages if these countries reverted from NAFTA to World Trade Organization tariff rates.11   On the other hand, protectionist measures create risks to the upside for inflation, especially when the economy is operating near full capacity. In weighing these                                             9 For more details, see N. Labelle St-Pierre, “Decomposing Canada’s Market Shares: An Update,” Bank of Canada Staff Analytical Note No. 2018-26 (August 2018); and D. Brouillette, J. Dorich, C. D’Souza, A. Gagnon and C.

Levchenko. “The Economics of Revoking NAFTA,” BIS Working Papers  No. 739 (August 2018).  
 - 7 - trade-offs, you can be sure that Governing Council will not lose sight of our primary mission. Low and stable inflation will help reduce at least one source of uncertainty for companies and households. Of course, there are a number of structural and other policies that are better suited than monetary policy to help manage what would be complex adjustments.  Governing Council also discussed whether the gradual approach to raising rates that we have been taking over the past year remains appropriate. It is a natural question to ask, given that the economy has been operating at potential for the past year and it is in this part of the cycle when interest rates typically rise to pre-empt a buildup in inflation pressures.  As I mentioned earlier, the factors that are pushing inflation to the top of our target band appear to be temporary and not signs of excess demand. These factors mean that inflation could turn out to be higher over the next couple of quarters than we had expected in July, but will most likely fall off afterward barring any new price shocks.   We will need to do a full update of our inflation outlook for the October MPR, but we already have a good idea of when the effects of the temporary factors at play right now are likely to dissipate. For example, the increases in gasoline prices from earlier this year are contributing 0.7 percentage point to above-target inflation today. This effect will largely recede by the first quarter of next year. We have seen this in the past, since fluctuations in energy prices have accounted for about three-quarters of the overall movement in inflation. To do our job without causing undue volatility in growth, we look through these factors, while remaining alert to signs of underlying inflation pressures. Furthermore, we still acknowledge that there may be more room to grow without causing inflation than we have built into our forecast. We also know that high levels of household debt have made the economy more sensitive to interest-rate increases than in the past. That is because people must commit more of their income to servicing their debt when borrowing cost rise, leaving less for other spending. The fact that the job market has been particularly strong, and that average household incomes are rising, helps this adjustment. Consumer confidence has also been relatively high. All this suggests that the economy is adjusting well and can adapt to higher interest rates.  The bottom line is that Governing Council agreed that the gradual approach we have been following is still appropriate.   Finally, we discussed how much momentum remains in the global expansion.  Few would disagree that the United States is showing considerable strength, but some commentators see a relatively flat US yield curve as a sign of trouble ahead. While there are downside risks to any outlook, Governing Council prefers to look at a broader range of indicators. For one thing, the yield curve is not currently inverted, and is therefore not pointing to significant slowing.12 Besides that, the shape of the curve may not be a reliable signal in the current environment anyway. This is because longer-dated bond yields are being                                             12 See E. Engstrom and S. Sharpe. “(Don’t Fear) The Yield Curve,” FEDS Notes. Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (June 28, 2018).  
 - 8 - distorted by a combination of central bank quantitative easing programs and strong private demand for long-dated safe assets. Other indicators to look at include credit spreads, which remain narrow.13 There may be some downside risk to our July outlook for the global economy coming from trade tensions, and cracks have appeared in certain emerging economies with financial vulnerabilities, but with limited spillovers to other countries.   Conclusion It is time for me to conclude. In terms of momentum in Canada, we are encouraged that the economy is adjusting well to higher borrowing rates and tighter guidelines for mortgage financing. We are also pleased with the continued shift in the composition of growth toward exports and business investment.  Recent data reinforce Governing Council’s assessment that higher interest rates will be warranted to achieve the inflation target. We will continue to take a gradual approach, guided by incoming data. In particular, the Bank continues to gauge the economy’s reaction to higher interest rates. The Bank is also monitoring closely the course of NAFTA negotiations and other trade policy developments, and their impact on the inflation outlook.                                              13 See M.

It is great to be back in regionalAustralia. I am responsible for the area of the Bank that focuses on financial stability. So my remarkstoday are going to cover one of the financial risks we have been focusing on over recent years – thehigh level of household debt in Australia. Household debt has been rising for a number of decades.How much of a concern is this? I am going to talk through the evolution of the current debt situationand how we see the current risks. Given that I am in Albury-Wodonga, I will finish with a fewcomments on housing markets and debt in regional Australia.Household debt in Australia has been rising relative to income for the past 30 years (Graph 1). Thisgraph shows the total household debt-to-income for Australia from the early 1990s until this year.Over that time it has risen from around 70 per cent to around 190 per cent. There are three distinctperiods. The first, from the early 1990s until the mid-2000s, saw the debt-to-income ratio more thandouble to 160 per cent. Then there was a period from around 2007 to 2013 when the ratio remainedfairly steady at 160 per cent. Finally, since 2013, the debt-to-income ratio has been rising again,reaching 190 per cent by 2018. [*]
10/09/2018The Evolution of Household Sector Risks | Speeches | RBAhttps://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2018/sp-ag-2018-09-10.html2/13Graph 1Australia has not been unique in seeing debt-to-income ratios rise. The median debt-to-income ratiofor a range of developed economies has also risen over the past 30 years. But the Australian debt-to-income ratio has risen more sharply. In fact, Australia has moved from having a debt-to-income ratiolower than around two thirds of countries in the sample to being in a group of countries that havedebt-to-income ratios in the top quarter of the sample. This suggests that there are bothinternational and domestic factors at play when it comes to debt-to-income ratios.There are two key international factors that have tended to increase the ability of households indeveloped countries, including Australia, to take on debt over the past few decades. The first is thestructural decline in the level of nominal interest rates over this period, partly reflecting a decline ininflation but also a decline in bank interest rate margins as a result of financial innovation andcompetition. With lower interest payments, borrowers could service a larger loan. The second isderegulation of the financial sector. Through this period, the constraints on banks' lending wereeased significantly, allowing credit constrained customers to access finance and banks to expandtheir provision of credit.But as noted, in Australia the household debt-to-income ratio has increased more than for manyother countries. The increase in household debt over the past few decades has been largely due to arise in mortgage debt. And an important reason for the high level of mortgage debt in Australia isthat the rental stock is mostly owned by households. Australians borrow not only to finance theirown homes but also to invest in housing as an asset. This is different to many other countries wherea significant proportion of the rental stock is owned by corporations or cooperatives (Graph 2). This

There is a clear tendencyfor countries where more of the housing stock is owned by households to have a higher householddebt-to income-ratio.Graph 2Potential vulnerabilitiesThis high level of household debt relative to income raises two potential vulnerabilities. First, becausemortgage lending is such an important part of bank balance sheets in Australia, any difficulties in theresidential mortgage market could translate to credit quality issues for banks (Graph 3). And since allof the banks have very similar balance sheet structures, a problem for one is likely a problem for all.This graph shows the share of banks' domestic credit as a share of total credit over the past coupleof decades. Australian banks have substantially increased their exposure to housing over this periodand housing credit now accounts for over 60 per cent of banks' loans. So the Australian bankingsystem is potentially very exposed to a decline in credit quality of outstanding mortgages.
10/09/2018The Evolution of Household Sector Risks | Speeches | RBAhttps://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2018/sp-ag-2018-09-10.html4/13Graph 3The risk that difficulties in the residential real estate market translate into stability issues for thefinancial institutions, however, appears to be currently low. The Australian banks are well capitalisedfollowing a substantial strengthening of their capital positions over the past decade. While lendingstandards were not bad to begin with, they have nevertheless tightened over the past few years ontwo fronts. The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) has pushed banks to more strictlyapply their own lending standards. And APRA has also encouraged banks to limit higher risk lending.Lending at high loan-to-valuation ratios has declined as a share of total loans, providing protectionagainst a decline in housing prices for both banks and households. And for loans that continue to beoriginated at high loan-to-valuation ratios, the use of lenders' mortgage insurance protects financialinstitutions from the risk that borrowers are unable to repay their loans. Overall, arrears rates onhousing loans remain very low.But the second potential vulnerability – from high household indebtedness – is that if there were anadverse shock to the economy, households could find themselves struggling to meet the repaymentson these high levels of debt. If they have little savings, they might need to reduce consumption inorder to meet loan repayments or, more extreme, sell their houses or default on their loans. Thiscould have adverse effects on the real economy – for example, in the form of lower economicgrowth, higher unemployment and falling house prices – which could, in turn, amplify the negativeshock.So what do the data tell us about the ability of households to service their debt? This graph showsthe ratio of household mortgage debt to income (a subset of the previous graph on household total
10/09/2018The Evolution of Household Sector Risks | Speeches | RBAhttps://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2018/sp-ag-2018-09-10.html5/13debt) on the left hand panel and various serviceability metrics on the right hand panel (Graph 4).The mortgage debt-to-income ratio shows the same pattern as total household debt-to-income –rising up until the mid-2000s then steadying for a few years before increasing again from around2013. The dashed line represents the total mortgage debt less balances in ‘offset’ accounts. Thisshows that taking into account these ‘buffers’, the debt-to-income ratio has still risen, although notby as much. So households in aggregate have some ability to absorb some increase in requiredrepayments.Graph 4In terms of serviceability, interest payments as a share of income rose sharply from the late 1990suntil the mid-2000s reflecting both the rise in debt outstanding as well as increases in interest rates.Interest payments as a share of disposable income doubled over this period. Since the mid-2000s,however, interest payments as a share of income have declined as the effect of declines in interestrates have more than offset the effect of higher levels of debt. Indeed even total scheduledpayments, which includes principal repayments, are lower than they were in the mid-2000s, as therise in scheduled principal as a result of larger loans was more than offset by the decline in interestpayments.
10/09/2018The Evolution of Household Sector Risks | Speeches | RBAhttps://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2018/sp-ag-2018-09-10.html6/13The risks nevertheless remain high and it is possible that the aggregate picture is obscuring risingvulnerabilities for certain types of households. Interest payments have been rising as a share ofincome in recent months, reflecting increases in interest rates for some borrowers, particularly thosewith investor and interest-only loans. Scheduled principal repayments have also continued to risewith the shift towards principal-and-interest, rather than interest-only, loans. There are therefore nodoubt some households that are feeling the pressure of high debt levels. But there are a number ofreasons why the situation is not as severe as these numbers suggest.First, the economy is growing above trend and unemployment is coming down. While incomes arestill growing slowly, good employment prospects will continue to support households meeting theirrepayment obligations. Second, as noted earlier, households have taken the opportunity over thepast decade to build prepayments in offset accounts and redraw facilities. In fact, despite thecontinuing rise in scheduled repayments, actual repayments relative to income have remained quitesteady as the level of unscheduled repayments of principal has declined and offset the rise inscheduled repayments. Third, as noted earlier, lending standards have improved over the past fewyears, resulting in an improvement in the average quality of both banks' and households' balancesheets. Much slower growth in investor lending, and declining shares of interest-only and high-loan-to-valuation lending have also helped to reduce the riskiness of new lending. And at the insistence ofthe regulator, banks have been tightening their serviceability assessments. In addition, stronghousing price growth in many regions over recent years will have lowered loan-to-valuation ratios formany borrowers. As noted earlier, arrears rates remain very low.The discussion above has focussed on the average borrower but what about the marginal borrower?For example, will the tightening standards result in some households being constrained in theamount they can borrow with flow-on effects to the housing market and the economy? Our analysissuggests that while we should remain alert to this possibility, it seems unlikely to result in awidespread credit crunch. The main reason is that most households do not borrow the maximumamount anyway so will not be constrained by the tighter standards. While the changes to lendingstandards have tended to reduce maximum loan sizes, this has primarily affected the riskiestborrowers who seek to borrow very close to the maximum loan size and this is a very small group.Most borrowers will still be able to take out the same sized loan.It has also been suggested that the expiry of interest-only loan terms will result in financial stress ashouseholds have to refinance into principal-and-interest loans that require higher repayments. Again,this is worth watching, but borrowers have been transitioning loans from interest-only to principal-and-interest for the past couple of years without signs of widespread stress. Our data suggest thatmost borrowers will either be able to meet these higher repayments, refinance their loans with a newlender, or extend their interest-only terms for long enough to enable to them to resolve theirsituation. There appears to be only a relatively small share of borrowers that are finding it hard toservice a principal-and-interest loan, which is to be expected given that over recent years,serviceability assessments for these loans have been based on the borrower's ability to makeprincipal-and-interest repayments. So far, the evidence suggests that the transition of loans frominterest-only to principal-and-interest repayments is not having a significant lasting effect on banks'housing loan arrears rates.
10/09/2018The Evolution of Household Sector Risks | Speeches | RBAhttps://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2018/sp-ag-2018-09-10.html7/13The distribution of household debtSo far, I have focussed on data for the household sector as a whole. But an important aspect ofconsidering the risks inherent in household debt is the distribution of that debt. If most of the debt isheld by households with lower or less stable income for example, it will be more risky than if asubstantial amount of the debt is held by households with higher or more stable income. In thisrespect, the data suggest that we can have some comfort. This graph shows the shares of householddebt held by income quintiles – the bottom 20 per cent of incomes, the next 20 per cent and so onup to the top 20 per cent of incomes (Graph 5). And it shows how these shares have changed fromthe early 2000s until 2015, the latest period for which the data are available. Around 40 per cent ofhousehold debt is held by households that are in the top 20 per cent of the income distribution andthis share has remained fairly steady for the past 20 years. Furthermore, households in the secondhighest quintile account for a further 25 per cent of the debt. So in total two-thirds of the debt isheld by households in the top 40 per cent of the income distribution. Nevertheless, around15 per cent of the debt is held by households in the lowest two income quintiles. Whether or not thispresents risks is not clear. Retirees are typically captured in these lower income brackets and if thisdebt is connected with investment property from which they are earning income, it may not beparticularly risky.Graph 5
10/09/2018The Evolution of Household Sector Risks | Speeches | RBAhttps://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2018/sp-ag-2018-09-10.html8/13Another potential source of risk in the distribution of debt is the age of the head of the household. Asnoted, a regular, stable income is important for servicing debt so people in the middle stages of theircareers typically have better capacity to take on and service debt. The next graph shows the sharesof debt for various age groups for owner occupiers, and how they have moved over the past coupleof decades (Graph 6).Graph 6Households in which the head is between the ages of 35 and 54 account for around 60 per cent ofthe debt. But there does appear over time to be a tendency for a higher share of owner occupierdebt to be held by older age groups. In part, the growing share reflects structural factors like lowerinterest rates. More importantly, it is not clear whether the higher share of debt increases the riskthat these households will experience financial stress. On the one hand, it might indicate that inrecent years, people have been unable to pay down their debt by the time they retire. If theycontinue to have large amounts of debt at the end of their working life, they might therefore bevulnerable. On the other hand, people are now remaining in the workforce for longer, possibly aresponse to better health and increasing life expectancies. They also hold more assets insuperannuation and have more investment properties. This improves their ability to continue toservice higher debt. And there is no particular indication that older people have higher debt-to-income or debt servicing ratios than younger workers.
10/09/2018The Evolution of Household Sector Risks | Speeches | RBAhttps://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2018/sp-ag-2018-09-10.html9/13So while the economy wide household debt-to-income ratio is high and rising, the distribution of thatdebt suggests that a large proportion of it is held by households that have the ability to service it. Itnevertheless bears watching.Regional dimensionsI thought I would finish off with some remarks about regional versus metropolitan differences. Froma financial stability perspective, we are mainly focussed on the economy as a whole. But we stillneed to be alert to pockets of risk that have the potential to spill over more broadly. These risks mayhave important regional dimensions, particularly to the extent that individual regions have lessdiversified industrial structures and are thus more vulnerable to idiosyncratic shocks. One recentexample has been the impact of the downturn in the mining sector on economic conditions inWestern Australia, and the subsequent deterioration in the health of household balance sheets andbanks' asset quality. The potential for the drought in eastern Australia to result in household financialstress is another.Data limitations make it difficult to drill down too far into particular regions. So I am going to focushere on a general distinction between metropolitan areas and the rest of Australia. As noted above,there tends to be a relationship between debt and housing prices. As housing prices rise, peopleneed to borrow more to purchase a home and with more ability to borrow, people can bid up theprices of housing. So one place to look for a metro/regional distinction might be housing prices.While there is clearly a difference in the absolute level of housing prices in cities and regional areas,over the long sweep, movements in housing prices in the regions have pretty much kept up withthose in capital cities (Graph 7). This graph shows an index of housing prices for each of the statesbroken down into capital city and rest of the state. While there are periods where growth in housingprices diverge, most obviously in NSW and Victoria in recent years, they follow a very similar pattern.This partly reflects the fact that some cities that are close to the capitals tend to experience similarmovements in house prices as the capitals.

The data suggest that the incidence of householdindebtedness is broadly similar in the capital cities and in the regions (Graph 8). In 2015, the latestyear for which we have data, around 50 per cent of regional households were in debt compared witharound 45 per cent of households in capital cities. But in previous years this was reversed. At abroad level, the proportion of households in debt seems fairly similar.
10/09/2018The Evolution of Household Sector Risks | Speeches | RBAhttps://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2018/sp-ag-2018-09-10.html11/13Graph 8Incomes and housing prices tend to be lower on average in regional areas than cities so we mightexpect debt to also be lower. But how do debt-to-income ratios compare? This next graph showsdebt-to-income ratios for cities and regional areas at various points over the past 15 years (Graph 9).In general, average debt-to-income ratios for indebted households in capital cities tend to be a bithigher than those for indebted households in regional Australia. But it is not a huge difference and itmostly reflects the fact that people with the highest incomes – and therefore, higher capacity tomanage higher debt-to-income ratios – tend to be more concentrated in cities. In general, it seemsthat regional households' appetite for debt is very similar to that of their city counterparts.

This raises potential vulnerabilities in both bankand household balance sheets.

It is a pleasure and a privilege, especially in front of such a large and important audience who impact the lives and financial security of so many New Zealanders. It is also timely to chat about financial issues given it is ‘Money Week’, the annual awareness week championed by the Commission for Financial Capability.   I know many people will be thinking, ‘what has the Reserve Bank Governor got to say about anything long-term? Doesn’t the Bank just sit and watch for outbreaks of inflation – shifting the official interest rate on a needs-be basis? Some will even comment publicly, ‘How dare the Governor speak outside of their 1 to 3 percent inflation mandate!’  I hope to convince you we have a strong vested interest in, and influence on, the long-term economic wellbeing of New Zealand. The long-term issues are critical to our task of maintaining low and stable consumer price inflation, promoting a sound and dynamic financial system, and meeting the currency needs of the public.  First, what do I see as the long-term challenges facing the globe?  I summarise the key plague on economic society as ‘short-termism’. This is the overt focus on the next day, week, or reporting cycle. In contrast, by long-term, I mean anything that ranges from ‘outcomes’ over the next few years, through to an ‘idealised vision’ that could last inter-generationally.    A short-term focus can be driven by the need to survive from day-to-day. However, it is too often driven by the desire to consume at an unsustainable rate. The desire for instant gratification or reward can often leave behind a trail of unintended consequences. Some of these consequences may impact on us personally, but we too often assume we won’t be the one affected. An often-posted analogy of short-termism is the seasonal over-imbibing at the staff Christmas party, and all of the personal and societal consequences that follow.   Let’s get more tangible.  We strive in business every day to achieve economic growth – or economic security and wealth. We also aspire to use this wealth in a pleasant, sustainable, natural environment that we can call home. We also aspire to live and bring our families up in a safe place, of social cohesion, being accepted and appreciated. And, we want to live in a place where everyone can participate despite our differences, a ‘diversification dividend’ not cost.   Wow, what a cool place that would be. Where do I buy the ticket? A virtuous, wealthy, and rich society.   Too often, however, due to short-termism, we view economic growth as something that comes at the expense of a sustainable environment, or social cohesion and cultural acceptance. How does this ‘vicious’ circle manifest itself so often around the world and through time?   The financial system plays a significant role. A financial system works best – is sound and efficient – when all relevant risks are adequately identified, priced, and allocated to those who can best manage them. These are the risks, in large part, that may lead you to consume/spend today, rather than save/invest for the future. You are either unconvinced you will be compensated sufficiently for the risks that could arise through time, or you haven’t 
   3  thought that far ahead or that well. The problem is that focusing on the short-term means that many risks are neither identified or priced, and often allocated to those who are least aware of them and unable to manage them. Our financial systems are struggling globally to identify, price, and allocate risk.   What have we witnessed over the last couple-of-hundred years or so? Incredible per-capita economic growth. Millions of people have been lifted out of poverty, and there has been a rapid increase in the human population and our longevity. This period represents an unprecedented rise in many positive economic welfare measures. The growth in productivity – output per person – is amazing.   But is all well, or at least as good as it could be? What are our big challenges – globally and at home in New Zealand?   There has been a rapid rise for many out of subsistence and into emerging or First-World income status. But we continue to experience massive challenges that are, too often, resolved through financial crises, wars or civil unrest; or at the cost of someone else or something, such as the environment.   At present we experience challenges such as:  Environmental degradation, with climate change now well accepted as a significant impact on economies worldwide. The impacts are physical through nature, and financial through changes in consumer and investor preferences, and regulation.   Mass urbanisation and all of the challenges this brings is accelerating globally, quite the opposite to what I was taught would happen when I was in school. Computers would mean we all lived on lifestyle blocks in a paperless world. Yeah right.   I have seen global estimates from the World Economic Forum that some 60 percent of the world population, within the next couple of decades, will live in cities with populations greater than 10 million people, many of these in current Emerging Market nations. The challenges this brings to resources, infrastructure, and social cohesion are immense – unprecedented. And we complain about Auckland traffic.  Ageing populations are also dominating the outlook for the next 30-plus years, with Japan being the canary for us all to watch. Their population is on the decline due to their demographic profile weighted so much to the elderly. Savings and consumption patterns are changing simply due to this population swing. The older have the savings and are demanding less in goods, but more in services, especially human contact. Loneliness is a significant and growing disease. Yet the owners of capital are struggling to create careers out of caring for the elderly, at least at incomes that attract and retain the people needed. The same could be said for tourism in New Zealand.   Mass migration (in addition to urbanisation) pressures are also growing globally, driven by the factors mentioned above. Climate change means people must leave and find new homes, witness the Sahara-African peoples virtually swimming to Europe. Social cohesion is being challenged as national boundaries and beliefs are being threatened with change.   Which brings me to the income and wealth inequalities that come and go through economic history – with the global economy currently testing fresh cyclical boundaries.   What do I mean by inequality? Well, even if the economic ‘pie’ has grown in total, the rewards are always skewed one way or another. Over recent decades, the rewards to the owners of capital (profits) have outstripped the owners of labour (wages) more than 
   4  throughout economic history. In addition, wage growth both within, and more so between, firms has become more dispersed. Supposed low-skilled jobs have been far out-paced by high skilled jobs.   Now we also have the rise of ‘superstar companies’ that are in the ‘winner take all (or most)’ of an entire industry. These superstar firms generally have lower ‘wages-to-profit’ ratios than their competitors, accentuating the income divergence. How do they manage this? Through superior economies of scale driven by technology and brand advantages that are not easily replicable. Witness Facebook, Amazon, Google, Alibaba and so on. This is also true within the financial sector, where big banks gain significant economies of scale, leaving smaller banks struggling to compete. This would be fine if it didn’t lead to other problems such as ‘too big to fail’ and excessive risk taking incentives.   We are not immune to these issues locally, not by any sense of the word. But, we do have opportunities to lead the globe in positive change if we can become more long-term in our economic activity.   In New Zealand, we are being challenged on the environmental consequences of our efforts. We also have significant ongoing migration and urbanisation, as people want to be part of our place and together. We have creaking infrastructure and suffer from over-exuberant asset (house) prices. We also have persistent and stubborn unemployment and low-income challenges. This is especially so amongst Pasifika and Māori, despite their significant contribution to our economic and cultural wellbeing, and despite the current labour shortages. And, we have a rapidly ageing, and too often lonely, population.   Underlying these challenges is New Zealand’s persistently low productivity growth – or economic output-per-person. The reasoning behind the low productivity is well understood but, apparently, difficult to combat in a coordinated, persistent, manner.   An excellent paper by our own Productivity Commission,1 outlines succinctly the problem of low productivity and the causes in New Zealand. In large part, our low output-per-person is due to the ‘capital-shallowness’ of much our economic activity. This refers both to physical and human (knowledge) capital. New Zealanders have low savings rates (personal capital), meaning they don’t tend to draw advantage from profits (the returns to capital). Likewise, many of our larger companies are driven to pay dividends (often offshore due to their ownership) rather than re-invest in their own company, or New Zealand more broadly. These challenges are compounded by the relatively small scale of New Zealand firms, and by a low level of technology and knowledge dispersion between firms.  Paul Conway challenges us all, including policymakers: assist small, remote, firms into the global economy; improve the matching of jobs and skills; use immigration wisely to lift human capital; make investment easier and more effective; moderate the pace of population growth to encourage capital-deepening; improve competition in the services sector; and strengthen the economic returns from science and innovation.    So with problem identification and solutions outlined, wouldn’t we just move on to resolution? Short-termism challenges us always and everywhere.                                                            1 Paul Conway, (2018), ‘Can the Kiwi Fly? Achieving productivity lift-off in New Zealand’, International Productivity Monitor, No. 34, Spring 2018.  
   5  Why do we run into roadblocks to long-termism?   Capitalism is necessary, and a marvel, driving human welfare in a strongly positive direction for a few centuries now. But we all know – even Adam Smith, the godfather of free markets knew – that capitalism is not perfect. Markets can, and do, fail for a variety of well researched and understood reasons. Otherwise, why would we need government, regulators, and a central bank?   A significant challenge is human myopia, the inability and/or unwillingness to think about the long-term. After all, ‘she’ll be right’.   Myopia is actually incentivised in many of our contracts – the drive to shorter deadlines and frequent reporting for rapid personal gratification. This shorter horizon is a perverse outcome. Annual bonuses for example can lead to excessive risk taking, lack of concern for unintended consequences, and a desire for short-term cost cutting and lack of reinvestment. However, the bonus was implemented with the intent of ‘buying the employee in’ to the business for long-term gain.   The myopia challenge is further enforced by what is known as the ‘principal-agent problem’. The advent of the remarkable limited-liability company structure has liberated economic activity. These legal structures allow people to take risks with their and others capital, but with more limited personal financial consequences.   The limited liability structures do, however, mean that responsibility for all of the outcomes of business activity can be compromised. Hence the list of rules, regulations, and company directorship codes that exist. The line between the owner of the capital (the principal) and the manager of the capital (the agent) is lengthened. ‘Who owns a company?’ is a tough question.2   This principal-agent separation gets even harder now that we have investment portfolios as our way of investing in ‘growth assets’ ie, in business. The link is now the saver (owner of the capital), the investment manager (who may even outsource parts of this), and then the company agent. Principal-agent-agent. This represents in large part the industry structure that most of the people in this audience operate in.   What does it mean? How responsible is each of the agents for the long-term preservation of the principal’s capital – and how can the principal insist on this responsibility to the level that matters to them – financially, ethically and otherwise? The asymmetry of information that exists in favour of each of the agents in this chain dwarfs the principal’s knowledge. Hence the drive for transparency and burden of proof in business.   Fortunately – in some ways – the growth of portfolio diversification means that a principal is not overly exposed to any one ‘rogue agent’ or unfortunate event. A Kiwisaver investor, for example, owns several hundred, if not thousands, of companies in small proportions. For every idiot company (or idiosyncratic risk) in a portfolio, there is likely to be an offsetting genius.   Unfortunately, in other ways, the portfolio diversification even further reduces the drive, willingness, and ability of the investor to demand disciplines on the companies they are                                                            2 Andrew G. Haldane, (2015), ‘Who owns a company?’, speech by Mr Andrew G Haldane, Executive Director and Chief Economist of the Bank of England, at the University of Edinburgh Corporate Finance Conference, Edinburgh, 22 May 2015. 
   6  invested in. You have to cluster the investment managers to demand excellence from some of the firms in these portfolios – to care about the long-term.   I won’t labour a significant additional challenge too much, but let’s not forget that investment managers are likewise incentivised to behave in a short-term manner too often also. The outcome of their behaviour leads to the pro-cyclical nature of investing, including institutional ‘herding’ and locking in losses, rather than benefiting from bargain price opportunities. Such institutional (and business confidence) herding destroys wealth, increases financial volatility, and kills long-term strategies.3 As Frankie Howerd, the British comedian, said: ‘there’s nowt so queer as folk’.   Another challenge is that of ‘externalities’ – the tragedy of the commons (and also the horizon). Too many risks are not priced (or managed) by any individual, and hence under-invested in, or not owned or managed. Why would I, for example, spend all my money cleaning a river that everyone else can benefit from and/or continue to pollute? I can’t capture all of the reward I am owed.   I am reminded of the first economics text book I was given at school (Samuelson) – posing the question on page one to entice my mind into the cut and thrust of economics (yawn, stare out the window).   ‘Why are diamonds expensive and water is free?’ After all, you can live without the first (perhaps as a bachelor), but not without the latter.   The answer was meant to be ‘scarcity’. Diamonds are rare and water is everywhere. Oh how quick things change. The answer now is that diamonds are sold in part under a cartel and marketed well, while water has never been properly priced – and hence too often misused and polluted, with drastic current consequences globally.   What are we left with from short-termism? Misallocated capital, under invested labour, pollution, and challenged societies. This is not the fault of capitalism. It is the reality of human nature.  By the way, these thoughts are not the rantings of a single Governor of a central bank. The issues are well understood. They in fact dominated the recent Kansas Federal Reserve Bank Economic Symposium I attended in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, only a couple of weeks ago. This is a prestigious annual gathering of wise economists, and me this time.   What were the Jackson Hole topics? Awareness of technology disruption and the rise of the ‘superstar firms’ – winner takes all/most. Rising industry concentration of firms, in the US especially. Economies of scale and ‘intangible’ capital that is excludable and hard to replicate assisting this concentration. Rising inequality as people move to low wage/profit firms away from high wage/profit firms. There was even a discussion of apparent monopsony wage-setting behaviour by some firms, especially amongst franchise chains.    Can we get better at this capitalism thing? Yes we can.  Deliberate strategies exist to force savers/investors to behave more long-term. I refer you to the New Zealand Superannuation Fund’s website, where simple instructive examples (and speeches) exist on how to be ‘long-term’ in behaviour. Understand your purpose, your                                                            3 Jukka Pelhman and Han van der Hoorn, (2010), ‘Procyclicality in Central Bank Reserve Management’, IMF Working Paper 10/150, June.  
   7  endowments (your relative natural advantages), your investment beliefs, and then stick to the strategies that best exploit all of the above. They’ve got it down to one page of instruction – say it simple, stupid.4  Also instructive, and critical, are the rapidly growing clusters of global capital concerned with better managing the failures that can arise from ‘short-termism’. Trillions of dollars of capital are now joining efforts under various umbrellas. One cluster is the United Nations efforts around: Principles of Responsible Investing; Carbon Disclosure Projects; Sustainable Development Goals; and the Global Compact for Work practices. There are also private sector and ‘NGO’ groupings. For example: Focusing Capital on the Long-Term; Inclusive Capitalism; and One Planet, a spinoff from the CoPP22 global climate change agreement signed in Paris in 2016 (to which New Zealand committed). And, the International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds led the way in developing guiding principles (“the Santiago Principles”) for the long-term management of sovereign funds.  Directly in the Reserve Bank’s camp, the G20 have established a Financial Stability Taskforce effort focusing on carbon reduction management. Likewise, there is a newly established Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System, as well as a rapidly growing green-bond market.   Where is all of this leading? Hopefully, these efforts will in part head off the usual manner in which we ‘reset the clock’, through some kind of crisis or unrest. Significant global firms, investors, regulators and representatives of civil society are banding together to work hard on resolving the perils of short-termism. If company boards and managers have a long-enough horizon, then there are no externalities – all issues are endogenous to their actions (eg, pollution, employment, inclusion, and sustainable profit).   A personally heart-warming recent local example is the group of New Zealand firms that have signed up to a joint effort to reduce their carbon footprint, under the Climate Leaders Coalition. This group has recognised that consumers are increasingly demanding inter-generational justice, investors want to be properly rewarded for all of the risks they are taking, insurers are increasingly concerned about the cost and ability to insure against climate volatility, and regulators are getting very itchy across many activities – building codes, firm behaviours and so on.   Where does New Zealand sit on the global stage for these long-term efforts?   I could argue that we are so small, no matter what we did across most of these issues, it wouldn’t impact global outcomes.   But I would prefer to argue that the world often looks to places like New Zealand for leadership (or at least hope and safety). I also note that we are a small island nation, agriculturally dependent, live mostly on the coastline, have significant foreign-country dependency for capital and insurance, and sell a ‘clean experience’ to tourists. Hence, we rely heavily on our reputation and management of the long-term issues such as climate change, social cohesion, and inclusion of all.   The great news is we are small, young of nation, lightly populated, green, kaitiaki (caretaking) of spirit, not dependent on the export of fossil fuels, and have a strong rule of law and sound moral compass. Significant and bold leadership is in our grasp.                                                               4 New Zealand Superannuation Fund, ‘White Paper’ series, www.nzsuperfund.nz  
   8    What are the long-term challenges facing the Reserve Bank?  At the Bank we tell the story of Te Pūtea Matua (our Māori name) more often as that of the Tāne Mahuta of New Zealand’s financial system.   In Māori mythology, Tāne Mahuta is the god of the forest and birds. Tāne Mahuta’s greatest feat was that he separated Papatūānuku (the earth mother) and Ranginui (the skyfather) so that sunlight could shine into his garden and grow independent of his parents. The Reserve Bank rose for a similar purpose back in 1934, to enable New Zealanders to better grow the New Zealand economy independent of foreign banks’ and economies’ credit cycles –particularly Britain and Australia.  You will hear a lot more of this in coming weeks. Why? First, storytelling is fun and helps people connect to their daily tasks at the Bank. Second, the Bank is an ecosystem of many activities, just as Tāne Mahuta is, especially with the wider garden (financial system). Severing a root, trunk, or branch will have full ecosystem implications. Finally, we are embarking on a Te Ao Māori strategy at the Bank to help us with diversity and inclusion in thought, and to ensure we are operating effectively given the growing significance of Māori economic activity within New Zealand’s financial landscape.   Te Pūtea Matua is in good stead for the future, but not without its challenges. These are driven by technology, economic development, global connectedness, and broader government, public, and employee expectations. It is an exciting and challenging time for the team.    Our current priorities outline the scope of change underway for Tāne Mahuta:    our legislation (our roots) is under review, with the idea of modernising and refreshing our scope and capabilities, including broader decision making committees. Witness our new dual mandate for inflation targeting and contributing to maximising sustainable employment;   the production and movement of our money (our sap) is under review, with new storage and distribution models, and the role of digital currency, being considered;   our payment and settlement systems and digital capability (our trunk) are being renewed, with a view to ongoing reliability, security from cyber-risks, and a move to the ‘cloud’;  our regulated financial institutions (the branches grafted on to Tāne Mahuta) are under review, including our relationship management with them, and our expectations of their business conduct, capital needs, failure management capabilities, and efficiency metrics; and   our people (the caretakers or kaitiaki) are being reinvigorated, with a focus on developing A Great Team, Best Central Bank vision.   Focusing on the long-term is core business for Te Pūtea Matua – the Reserve Bank. The maintenance of low and stable inflation is a necessary condition of sustainable economic growth. We were pioneers in inflation targeting, with the goal decided by society (1-3% annual inflation), and then the Bank being operationally independent to do its work. This operational independence is critical – that is what ensures we do not suffer from short-termism. New Zealand, and much of the developed world, has a history of high and rising inflation due to over-weighting near-term demands.   
   9  We also understand the importance of our financial stability and currency issue roles. We need to prudentially regulate in a manner that is both sound and efficient in all its forms – cost, allocative, and dynamic efficiency. This means we ‘bridge the principal-agent gap’.   Doing so means we can be unpopular with the regulated industries (the agents), which can be noisy at times. We insist on an adequate capital buffer to absorb losses, internal capability to manage the shop, and ‘skin in the game’ via directors attesting to these factors. We also insist on transparency so that customers and competitors can keep an eye on each other. Likewise, for the large, systemically important, banks we insist on failure management capabilities – where we can step in and keep the bank going so that the whole system doesn’t fail.   We can also be unpopular with wider New Zealand, as shifting interest rates and/or implementing and altering the loan-to-value ratio that banks are allowed to lend at, are often not immediate vote winners. These activities directly cut across our human instinct for instant gratification, despite in the long-run maintaining a stable financial system and reducing the scale of financial volatility and/or crises.   We aren’t here to win votes, but we are aware that our stakeholders are demanding more from us, and we are responding. As a result, we have developed a new vision for the Bank, we want to be A Great Team, Best Central Bank.   All of our strategic priorities work towards this goal. We have visualised ‘our island’ that we will always move towards on the horizon, one that all New Zealanders can be proud of and that Tāne Mahuta – our Bank – can stand tall on. To reach ‘our island’, we need to be aware of the long-term forces shaping the global economy, the very things we have just been talking about. These factors will have a significant impact on the allocation of resources, and the future wellbeing and stability of the New Zealand economy.   We are embarking on, amongst other things, our own climate change strategy – focused on our own activities as well as our regulatory duties with concern for financial stability. We need to factor climate change issues into our concern for financial stability and efficiency.   To be most effective, we are committed to working cooperatively on these issues, in particular harnessing the New Zealand Council of Financial Regulators (COFR) to provide longer-term leadership. COFR includes the Bank, the Treasury, the Financial Markets Authority, and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. As part of our commitment, the COFR are discussing their own ‘island’ or vision, so as to best identify work effort and prioritisation – moving beyond a ‘show and tell’ group.   And we will continue to use our strong international reputation and connectedness to work with other central banks, international financial institutions, and global regulators to further our understanding and, perhaps even, show leadership in places such as the South Pacific.   Collaboration and a long-term vision are critical to growing the wider financial ecosystem that lies beneath the branches of Tāne Mahuta. At present, the systemically-important banks dominate Tāne Mahuta’s ecosystem. The important insurance sector is also patchy, both in customer coverage and competitiveness.   Life insurance, for example, has a low coverage rate across New Zealanders and a high premium-cost compared internationally. Meanwhile, general insurance has better coverage, but the industry is heavily concentrated in the number of providers. Health insurance is also complex, with the state-owned Accident Compensation Commission providing some cover, with the rest of this sector’s insurance provision highly concentrated. Industry concentration, low coverage, and high costs are not the greatest look for an efficient system.  
   10   In 2007, I co-authored a speech with Dr Alan Bollard, the then Governor. We outlined the important role of the financial system and the unique challenges and weaknesses of New Zealand. Since then, and following the Capital Market Taskforce, led by our late-friend Rob Cameron, some things have changed and improved, much hasn’t.   The growth of the NZ Super Fund, the depth of the Kiwisaver funds, and enhanced financial market regulation (with the birth of the Financial markets Authority) are great outcomes. Likewise, it is positive to see the Treasury committing to deeper bond issuance over a longer horizon, to keep New Zealand in the market and providing a yield curve benchmark. And it is encouraging that the Reserve Bank insisted on core liquidity measures for the banking system, as well as robust capital levels, and failure management capabilities. In addition, the insurance sector has a clearer regulatory regime.   However, much has not changed. Our listed equity market remains small relative to the economy, banks remain dominant in intermediation, and it is difficult to invest outside of the listed market in any scale with access limited. We still concentrate most of our investment in housing equity – rather than productive equity – relying on leverage from offshore borrowing. This is not a formula that will create ‘capital deepening’ in our economic efforts.   A vibrant and healthy financial ecosystem requires deep capital markets, with a long-term horizon, to best allocate capital in Aotearoa. We have much to work on to remain sustainably prosperous, but we are committed and long-term focused.

      Page 2/14   Ladies and Gentlemen Almost exactly ten years ago, on 15 September 2008, Lehman Brothers, the fourth-largest US investment bank at the time, filed for bankruptcy. The ensuing storm engulfed the global financial markets with a ferocity and magnitude that took all market observers by surprise. The collapse of Lehman Brothers made it clear that many financial institutions could not withstand such a buffeting without government support. The financial crisis spilled over rapidly into the real economy, resulting in the deepest global recession since the Great Depression. We all have our own personal memories of this difficult period. Many of you are probably thinking of 16 October 2008, the day on which the Swiss authorities stepped in to support UBS with a comprehensive package of measures. Back then, I was working at the Federal Finance Administration. The fact that we were obliged to burden the state and the taxpayers with an exposure worth billions to stabilise a big bank made a lasting impression on me. The lack of resilience in the banking system forced governments across the world to plough huge sums into bank bail-outs. It was the only way to protect their economies from the enormous damage that a banking system collapse would have wrought. The financial crisis demonstrated in no uncertain terms that the banking system was not sufficiently ‘weatherproof’. The financial crisis also showed clearly that particular risks stem from large, highly interconnected banks. Owing to their size and market position, such banks cannot exit the market without severe consequences for the banking system and the real economy. In industry jargon, they are ‘systemically important’. Thus, they enjoy an implicit guarantee that the state will intervene in an emergency. This form of market failure is now known the world over as the ‘too big to fail’ issue.  In my speech today, I will be looking into this issue, one that is particularly relevant to Switzerland. I will start by discussing the causes and effects of ‘too big to fail’, and how it manifests itself in Switzerland, before moving on to the reasons why banking regulation before the crisis did not sufficiently address the risks posed by ‘too big to fail’ banks. Based on this analysis, in the third part of my speech I will describe the wide-ranging regulatory measures taken at international and national level to resolve ‘too big to fail’. Let me just present our own conclusion up front: In Switzerland, the response was quick, targeted and, at the same time, cost-effective. On the one hand, the regulatory amendments strengthened banks’ resilience, reducing the likelihood of a bank getting into financial distress. On the other hand, they introduced measures aimed at ensuring that even a systemically important bank can exit the market in an orderly way in the event of a crisis. We are convinced that the Swiss big banks and the Swiss banking system are much more weatherproof today than they were ten years ago. Many of the planned measures have already been implemented.  
     Page 3/14   However, we have still not quite achieved our objective. Only once the agreed measures have been fully implemented will the conditions for resolving ‘too big to fail’ in Switzerland be in place. The ‘too big to fail’ issue So what is behind ‘too big to fail’, and what concrete form does it take in Switzerland?  a) ‘Too big to fail’ institutions must be bailed out in a crisis ... As I mentioned at the start, ‘too big to fail’ means that an individual institution is so important that the state is under a de facto obligation to bail it out in a crisis. This state obligation arises under two conditions. First, if the affected institution provides services that are of crucial importance to the national economy and which are generally indispensable. Second, if these services cannot be provided by other market participants at short notice – in other words, they are not substitutable.  How pronounced are these two aspects in the banking sector? First, banks generally provide a wide range of essential services for the economy, such as lending or payment services. Second, these services are not easily substitutable, particularly at big banks. Banks are closely interconnected with each other, and with the rest of the economy. The result is that problems at one bank can spill over to other banks and the rest of the economy. The larger the bank and the higher its market share, the smaller the likelihood that other market participants will be able take over important functions at short notice in the event of a crisis.  Thus, a bank’s size and market position are important indicators for assessing its systemic importance. Specific parameters are the bank’s share of domestic lending and deposit business, and its importance for payment transactions. Another widely used measure of systemic importance is the ratio of balance sheet total to GDP, as this is a good indicator of the bank’s interconnectedness and the (lack of) substitutability of its services.1 b) ... as their failure would come at too high an economic cost If a ‘too big to fail’ bank gets into distress, it jeopardises not just itself but also the stability of the financial system as a whole and, as a direct consequence, the real economy. The high economic costs can be illustrated using two mechanisms. The higher the bank’s market share of lending business, the greater the probability that the economy will not be provided with enough liquidity if that bank gets into difficulties. First, finding alternative credit providers will take time. Second, in the event of the failure of a systemically important bank, the assets of households and companies will – at least   1 So even though in most cases – including here – the term used is ‘too big to fail’, it is not just an institution’s size that makes it systemically important. In addition to size and market share, its risk profile, economic interconnectedness and (organisational) complexity are important variables. As a result, the terms ‘too important to fail’, ‘too complex to fail’ and ‘too interconnected to fail’ are also used. 
     Page 4/14   temporarily – be frozen, with the attendant negative impact on consumption and investment. Here too, the maxim applies: the higher the institution’s market share of deposit business, the greater the fallout in the event of a crisis. The second mechanism is based on the fact that, as I have already mentioned, banks are closely interconnected. Within this network, systemically important banks provide essential services for other banks. For example, they play a key role in system-wide liquidity provision and adjustment between banks. Normally, this takes the form of short-term interbank lending. If a key player in this network gets into difficulty, this interbank market can seize up, causing problems for other, otherwise sound banks, too.  c) The result is false incentives and high risks for society as a whole A systemically important bank can expect to be bailed out because the cost of failure for the real economy would be extremely high. In other words: the bank benefits from an implicit state guarantee. The consequence of this are far-reaching, as it provides significant false incentives for a bank’s shareholders, management and creditors.  On the one hand, shareholders and management of a ‘too big to fail’ bank benefit from unjustifiably low capital borrowing costs, compared to other banks. The state guarantee is tantamount to a subsidy worth billions.2 It allows shareholders and managements to take on more debt and greater risk.3 On the other hand, the state guarantee means that creditors have less incentive to make sure that the bank does not take on excessive risk. If all goes well, they will benefit from virtually risk-free interest income. If, however, things do go wrong, the state will have to intervene and the creditors will not be held liable for any losses that may arise. The mere assumption that a bank is too big to fail can be a self-fulfilling prophecy.4 On the assumption that it will be bailed out if necessary, the bank may take on excessive risk much more readily, and focus its business model too heavily on debt-based growth. Thus, the bank becomes even bigger, thereby increasing the likelihood that the state will have to intervene in a crisis, so that the original assumption proves to be correct. Given this increased likelihood of a bail-out, the bank can now take on even more risk, and the de facto bail-out obligation becomes even more acute – a vicious circle.  This bail-out obligation can result in very high and unforeseen costs to the state. The scale of these costs was highlighted by the global financial crisis, which at the time saw announced   2 For example, cf. International Monetary Fund (2014) for an estimate of the magnitude of this subsidy. 3 Cf. Afonso et al. (2014). 4 Cf. Alessandri and Haldane (2009). 
     Page 5/14   state support for the financial sector in advanced economies amounting to some 20% of GDP (cf. slide 2).5  State budgets, which are already under strong pressure from the recession associated with a financial crisis, can be overstretched by the cost of state support measures. And indeed, during the crisis, a number of countries did find themselves having to shoulder costs well in excess of their financial capacities. Ultimately, they coped by resorting to external support.  d) The ‘too big to fail’ issue is especially pronounced in Switzerland As I’ve mentioned, in Switzerland, too, a package of state support measures for UBS in 2008 was unavoidable. The capital injection of around CHF 6 billion from the Confederation amounted to some 10% of federal receipts, while the distressed assets of up to USD 60 billion that the SNB was willing to take on represented some 10% of GDP.6 In its 2011 dispatch on the ‘too big to fail’ (TBTF) legislation, the Federal Council noted that this commitment was associated with considerable risks for taxpayers, and that future rescue packages might not be financially sustainable for Switzerland.7  This is because the ‘too big to fail’ issue is especially pronounced here in Switzerland. The two big banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, have very large balance sheets relative to GDP, owing to their substantial international activities (cf. slide 3). At the same time, they also have a significant market share of domestic lending and deposit business, and are major players in the area of payment transactions.  Moreover, in an international comparison, three other banks which have been designated as systemically important by the SNB – PostFinance, Raiffeisen Group and Zürcher Kantonalbank – also have very large balance sheets relative to GDP. For example, Raiffeisen and ZKB relative to Swiss GDP are about double the size of the largest US banks relative to US GDP.8  Shortcomings in the TBTF regulations before the crisis Ladies and gentlemen, the global financial crisis has clearly demonstrated that, not least for Switzerland, the ‘too big to fail’ issue is real and the costs and risks for society as a whole are too high for this state of affairs to be simply accepted.   5 Cf. Horton et al. (2009). 6 Cf. Swiss National Bank (2008). 7 Cf. Swiss Federal Council (2011). 8 Share of balance sheet total relative to Swiss and US GDP respectively at end-2017: ZKB 25%; Raiffeisen 34%; UBS 138%; Credit Suisse 112%; JPMorgan Chase 13%; Bank of America 12%. 
     Page 6/14   a) ‘Too big to fail’ issue: recognised but insufficiently addressed by regulation ... Looking back today, it is clear that this issue was underestimated before the crisis – both in general and by the regulators. For instance, before the crisis, neither the international recommendations on banking regulation nor the Swiss regulatory provisions contained anything that explicitly addressed the systemic importance of individual banks and the associated risks. And this despite the fact that people were aware of the issue before the crisis – both in Switzerland and elsewhere.9 The term ‘too big to fail’ itself already featured in political debate during the 1980s in the US, in the context of difficulties experienced at a number of financial institutions. The first bank that was referred to as ‘too big to fail’ was the Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company, at that time the seventh-largest bank in the US, which sought recourse to state support in 1984.10 So, at this point, one could legitimately ask the question: why didn’t legislators, regulators and supervisory authorities tackle this known problem more vigorously before the crisis? The short answer is: The risks stemming from ever larger and ever more globally interconnected banks were underestimated, and as a result, the true magnitude of the ‘too big to fail’ issue was likewise underestimated.  The pre-crisis era was dominated by a general mood of self-confidence and optimism. This is hardly surprising, considering the long phase of comparatively low macroeconomic turbulence. In such an environment, concerns over the sustainability of economic development appeared to be misplaced. Thus, the risks attached to the growth and the globalisation strategies of many banks were ignored.  Moreover, the underestimation of risk was closely bound up with the prevailing regulatory paradigm at that time, which overlooked the significance of mutual dependencies between banks. Instead, it was assumed that the stability of the system as a whole was ensured, so long as each individual bank held enough capital to cover its own risks. Yet this assumption disregards the fact that, as a bank’s size, market share and interconnectedness increase, the economic costs associated with bank failure rise disproportionately. Allied to this underestimation of the significance of systemic interlinkages was an excessive faith in modelling, to which the supervisory authorities also subscribed.11 There was a general conviction that the commonly used quantitative models for measuring risk captured the actual risks in the banking system fully and reliably – a dangerous misapprehension. For instance, these models’ risk calculations were based on correlations of price trends in the recent past, while often disregarding the fact that such correlations can change rapidly and significantly, for reasons that are not directly apparent from the data. Moreover, the models simply did not   9 The ‘too big to fail’ issue had been discussed in detail in a number of academic studies and textbooks before 2008; for example, cf. Stern and Feldman (2004).  10 Cf. Moosa (2010). 11 For example, cf. Bernanke (2006). 
     Page 7/14   sufficiently replicate certain risks which grew to major proportions over the course of the crisis, such as the default risk of positions which the banks were holding on the assumption that they could easily sell them at short notice.12 Since the regulatory capital requirements largely relied on these model-based calculations, they did not adequately take account of the actual risk exposure. Against this background, the resilience of many banks proved to be insufficient overall during the crisis. Relative to their risk exposure, the banks simply did not have large enough liquidity and capital cushions. They were unable to absorb large outflows of funds and losses.  In short: before the crisis, the practical relevance of the ‘too big to fail’ issue was underestimated. At the same time, the belief that the risks in the banking system could be precisely quantified and monitored by means of sophisticated statistical models led to a false sense of security. These are key explanations for the inadequacies in banking regulation worldwide before the crisis. b) ... in Switzerland too These aspects also played a key role in Swiss regulatory practice before the crisis. Like a lot of big banks in other countries, UBS and Credit Suisse also pursued a growth and globalisation strategy that focused heavily on investment banking in the decade leading up to the crisis. UBS, in particular, had set itself the goal of becoming one of the global leaders in investment banking.13  Such global business activities enabled the big banks to achieve impressive returns for many years (cf. slide 4). Their financial soundness and strategic direction were thus rarely questioned.14 The risks taken on by the big banks as part of this development were widely underestimated.  In the years before the crisis, supervisory authorities and regulators had warned of potential risks associated with rapidly expanding balance sheets and shrinking capitalisation (cf. slide 5). For instance, the Swiss Federal Banking Commission (SFBC), the predecessor of today’s Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA), had already stepped up its supervision of Switzerland’s two big banks by the end of the 1990s.15 The SNB, in its Financial Stability Reports from 2003 onwards, pointed out that both big banks were highly leveraged in an international comparison.16 Together with the SFBC, the SNB was also an early advocate within the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision of an international tightening of capital requirements for big banks. However, these calls failed to garner enough support, and, due to   12 For example, cf. Stulz (2008) and Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2016). 13 For example, cf. UBS (2004), p. 7: ‘We have an ambitious vision – to be recognized as the best global financial services firm. We are the world’s largest wealth manager, while in the investment banking and securities business we are in a select bracket of major houses.’  14 Cf. Control Committees of the National Council and the Council of States (2010), p. 3104.  15 Cf. FINMA (2009), p. 22.  16 For example, cf. Swiss National Bank (2003). 
     Page 8/14   considerations relating to international competitiveness, it was decided that Switzerland would not go it alone.17  At the same time, the Swiss authorities and banks, like their peers elsewhere, also fell victim to the widespread over-reliance on models, leading to a distortion of risk assessment. Thus in 2004 the SFBC, for instance, granted UBS permission to use its own adapted risk model to assess the market risk, i.e. the financial risk, stemming from changes in the market valuation of the bank’s assets. Using the adapted risk model, the maximum assumed risk of loss on the corresponding positions, and hence the requisite capital requirement, was reduced.18 Granting permission to use this model was, in the conditions prevailing at the time, a logical step and in line with international practice. During the crisis, however, it became clear that the over-reliance on risk models was a mistake – something which FINMA (the successor to the SFBC) has also acknowledged in hindsight.19 Switzerland’s regulatory response to the ‘too big to fail’ issue The financial crisis vividly exposed the shortcomings of banking regulation. A broad consensus quickly developed over the need for a thorough overhaul of the regulatory framework. In Switzerland, the UBS case, in particular, generated strong political momentum for stricter banking regulations. a) Extensive adjustment of international regulatory standards At international level, the Basel Committee and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) subsequently adopted a number of measures to strengthen banks’ resilience and find a solution to ‘too big to fail’.  With respect to banks’ resilience, the Basel Committee increased the minimum risk-weighted capital requirements, in terms of both quality and quantity. It also specified a capital surcharge for systemically important banks over and above the new minimum requirements applying to all banks. Furthermore, it revised the calculation of risk-weighted assets with the goal of restricting banks’ freedom to determine capital requirements. At the same time, it introduced an unweighted capital adequacy requirement – a leverage ratio, to serve as a non-risk-based backstop to the risk-based capital requirement for banks. The FSB measures are aimed at improving the resolvability of systemically important banks. In particular, requirements have been defined for resolution planning and for the accumulation of gone-concern loss-absorbing capacity. These measures are intended to ensure that systemically important banks can exit the market in an ‘orderly’ fashion in the event of a crisis.   17 For example, cf. FINMA (2009), p. 19. 18 Cf. FINMA (2009), p.30 et seq. 19 Cf. Branson (2011), p.5: ‘For several decades we believed that the greater sophistication of risk management techniques allowed us to tolerate thinner capital cushions. We were wrong.’  
     Page 9/14   b) Swiss TBTF regulations rest on two complementary pillars … In Switzerland, parliament had already passed a package of legislation back in 2011 that recognises the special importance of the ‘too big to fail’ issue and is in line with the international approach. It is based on two complementary pillars with special requirements for systemically important banks.  The first pillar defines measures to strengthen the resilience of these banks and thereby reduce the likelihood of a systemically important bank getting into financial distress.  In particular, the revised regulations impose stricter capital and liquidity requirements on banks. They have to meet both risk-weighted capital requirements and a leverage ratio requirement. Equity capital allows banks to absorb losses, thus protecting them from insolvency. At the same time, a high capital buffer reduces the incentives for shareholders to take excessive risks as they would be putting their ‘own money’ on the line. Liquid assets, in turn, ensure that a bank is capable of withstanding sudden, unexpected outflows of short-term liabilities without getting into acute payment difficulties. The bank-specific level of these requirements is today partly determined by the bank’s degree of systemic importance. In contrast to the pre-crisis era, the regulations now expressly take into account the risks to the financial system and the economy as a whole arising from the failure of a systemically important bank. In this way, the regulations also explicitly rein in incentives for excessive growth in the sector. However, even the new, stricter capital requirements cannot eliminate the risk of a systemically important bank getting into existential difficulties. First, the risks are difficult to assess and they also change over time. Second, the very nature of banks’ operations means that they will always be to some degree susceptible to crises. Absolute security can never be achieved if, at the same time, we want to safeguard the useful economic functions of banks. The second pillar of the TBTF regulations comes into play in the event that a systemically important bank gets into financial distress despite increased resilience. It is intended to ensure that the bank is resolvable. In other words: Even a systemically important bank should be able to exit the market in an orderly fashion. Its recovery or wind-down must not be allowed to jeopardise the stability of the economy as a whole.  For this purpose, the regulations stipulate requirements for resolution planning. For example, by end-2019, systemically important banks in Switzerland have to prepare ‘emergency plans’ demonstrating that they will be able to continue their systemically important functions in Switzerland without interruption in the event of a crisis.  The second pillar also specifies requirements for loss-absorbing capacity. Systemically important banks must hold sufficient financial resources to cover losses in a crisis or to finance the costs of a separation of systemically important functions. Banks can use so-called 
     Page 10/14   ‘bail-in’ instruments for this purpose. These are essentially debt securities which can be converted into equity or written down in the event of impending insolvency.20 These measures are especially designed to counter the de facto obligation by the state to provide assistance in the event of a crisis. The organisational arrangements facilitate an orderly separation of the central functions within a reasonable timeframe. Furthermore, creditors are to participate directly in the default risk. The intention is to ensure a bail-in by creditors rather than a bail-out by the state in the event of a crisis by predefining the criteria for when debt securities are converted or written down. The Swiss regulatory approach is thus aimed at tackling the fundamental causes of ‘too big to fail’. This was also the conclusion reached by the Federal Council in its 2015 evaluation report. Its assessment of the Swiss approach was positive, considering it appropriate in an international comparison.21  At the same time, the Federal Council concluded that further action was needed in relation to certain parameters. In particular, it stressed that, due to the special significance of ‘too big to fail’ in our country, Switzerland should be at the forefront when it comes to setting resilience requirements. Consequently, it prescribed an increase in capital requirements. These changes have been criticised in some quarters. Concerns were voiced that some of the adjustments were unreasonable and would put banks at a competitive disadvantage internationally.22 How justified is this criticism? c) … and are designed to be cost-effective All regulations inevitably meet with resistance because they create added costs for the regulated institutions. But it is often the only way to bring about the desired change in conduct. In any discussion of the costs of regulation, it is important to weigh the private costs incurred by those subject to the regulations against the costs to the economy as a whole. As long as the private costs are less than the macroeconomic benefit, then the regulations make economic sense. Yet such a cost/benefit analysis is complex and fraught with uncertainty. The literature is unambiguous on the macroeconomic costs and benefits of the post-crisis increase in capital requirements.23 The benefits far exceed the costs involved. The benefits of the higher capital requirements are that they reduce the likelihood and the severity of a banking crisis.24 However, economic costs from stricter capital requirements may arise in the form of higher borrowing rates, reduced lending and an associated weakening in economic   20 Cf. Swiss National Bank, (2016), p. 17, for an overview of the specific requirements. 21 Cf. Swiss Federal Council (2015), p. 1932. 22 Cf. Federal Department of Finance (FDF) (2016).  23 For example, cf. the literature review in FDF (2017), section 3. 24 A number of empirical studies show that bank crises are generally associated with a sharp reduction in growth. For example, cf. Haldane (2017) and, for Switzerland, Junge and Kugler (2013). 
     Page 11/14   growth. Empirical evidence shows that these negative effects are minor, particularly if the capital requirements are increased gradually as planned.25  Cost-effectiveness also needs to be taken into consideration when deciding on specific regulatory measures. Switzerland made a conscious choice to adopt a lean approach to resolvability requirements. Consequently, the regulations do not directly impact on banks’ business models or organisational structures. Nor do they distinguish between desirable and undesirable banking activities or prohibit certain practices. Rather, the Swiss approach is based on incentives and subsidiarity. Banks ‘only’ have to demonstrate that they are ‘resolvable’ in the event of a crisis. Of course, the calibration of the capital requirements takes international competitiveness into account. The Federal Council’s 2015 evaluation report gives great weight to the comparison of the Swiss regulations with those of other countries. We are convinced that the improved regulations contribute to the good framework conditions that characterise Switzerland in general. This in turn is an essential prerequisite for the sustainable and successful development of the Swiss banking sector. A robust, well-regulated banking system is a key locational advantage in international competition. It attracts clients and businesses, and is therefore desirable not only in the interests of financial stability, but also from the perspective of the globally active banks themselves.  d) Implementation of the TBTF regulations is already well under way Thus, ladies and gentlemen, the Swiss regulatory approach targets the fundamental causes of the ‘too big to fail’ issue and is cost-effective. We are therefore confident that full implementation by the end-2019 deadline will create the conditions necessary for resolving the ‘too big to fail’ issue in Switzerland. What is our current status regarding fulfilment of the TBTF requirements? In our latest Financial Stability Report published in June, we stated that implementation is already well under way. In terms of the resilience requirements – the first pillar of the regulations – both big banks are on track. They already fully meet the requirements for risk-weighted capital that will apply from end-2019.  As far as the second pillar – resolution – is concerned, the two big banks have made further progress. Here too, they already meet some of the requirements in full, namely those relating to gone-concern loss-absorbing capacity.  Nevertheless, the finish line has not yet been reached. More progress needs to be made in increasing resilience with regard to the leverage ratio.   25 Rather, higher-capitalised banks tend to grant more loans, not fewer (for example, cf. Cecchetti, 2014, and Gambacorta and Shin, 2016). The minor negative impact can be explained by the fact that, first, more equity capital does not necessarily lead to higher capital costs for banks (Modigliani-Miller offset) and, second, potential higher costs in a competitive banking sector are not passed on in full to borrowers (cf. Junge and Kugler, 2017, for Switzerland).  
     Page 12/14   Moreover, the work that still needs to be done under the second pillar should not be underestimated. The resolution of a bank, especially a globally active big bank, is highly complex. It needs to be planned in a thorough and prudent manner. To ensure that a bank can be resolved in an emergency, further progress is needed in three areas in particular. First, resolution funding plans need to be drawn up, which FINMA, as the competent authority, is currently in the process of doing. These aim to ensure that a bank has sufficient liquidity to implement a resolution. Second, loss-absorbing capacity must be ensured at the level of each individual entity within the big banks. Previously, the focus was on loss-absorbing capacity at consolidated group level. Third, both big banks must further reduce the financial and operational dependencies within the group.  In addition, the two banks need to finalise the required emergency plans for Swiss institutions with systemically important functions by end-2019.  Today, all market participants are well aware of the significance of ‘too big to fail’ in Switzerland, and the present environment is propitious for completing the final phase towards full implementation of the regulations. It is important to avoid the mistakes of the past and ensure that, in a favourable environment, we do not turn a blind eye to the costs and risks of a crisis or view the necessary regulatory measures as excessive. Full implementation of all requirements is essential if the Swiss financial system is to be better equipped to weather future storms. Conclusion Let me now sum up. The global financial crisis ten years ago made us only too keenly aware of how serious a problem ‘too big to fail’ is. It also revealed just how inadequate the regulations were for dealing with this issue. This was especially true for Switzerland with its important financial sector.  Huge efforts have since been made to improve regulations, both internationally and nationally. The reforms are aimed at enhancing the resilience of systemically important banks to weather future storms and at reducing the risk of extensive storm damage at a macroeconomic level.  In Switzerland, we have opted for a cost-effective regulatory approach. Many of the agreed measures have already been implemented. We are therefore confident that the Swiss big banks and the Swiss banking system in general are much more weatherproof today than they were ten years ago.  Equally, we are confident that full implementation of the Swiss ‘too big to fail’ regulations will reduce the false incentives that underlie the issue and create the necessary conditions for resolving the issue here in Switzerland. The state should no longer be obliged to use government funds to bail out a bank.

SPEECH  Side 1 af 9 BY MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS PER CALLESEN, DANMARKS NATIONALBANK AT FINANCE DENMARK'S EXECUTIVE CONFERENCE, 3 SEPTEMBER 2018    The European banking union in perspective – is there risk sharing and joint liability?    CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY    Thank you for inviting me to speak.  Many of us who are present today had an opportunity to focus on the economy at the annual meeting of the Association of Local Banks a few months ago. So I will provide only a brief summary – without any figures. Instead, my presentation will be about international cooperation and specifically the European banking sector and the reinforced banking co-operation, also known as the banking union. I will not cover all aspects of this topic, but will focus on the issue of risk sharing, i.e. whether some institutions will be liable for the debts of others.  The main conclusions will be: (1) The economy and financial stability are still on a steady course. (2) International rule-based cooperation is under pressure. That gives cause for concern and emphasises the need to pro-tect the cooperation that exists and that we are able to participate in. (3) As regards the banking union and the euro area, a clear picture is emerg-ing – so far and looking ahead – of very limited money transfers between member states. In other words, there is limited risk sharing and joint li-ability. Some Europeans lament this, and there are arguments both for and against risk sharing, but there are good reasons why the institutions have been designed as they have.  The economic and financial situation Four short remarks about the economic and financial situation: Firstly: The economic recovery has been successful until now. It has been carefully nurtured with reforms and what we might call macroprudential nudging. We have avoided a situation where government and parliament have lost patience. Consumers and investors are spending money earned       3 September 2018 
  Side 2 af 9 rather than borrowed on consumption and investment. And this time around, banks have been more hesitant to grant risky credits. In short, we have not seen a fiscal or credit expansion with a resultant boom and bust cycle this time. We must ensure that this continues. So, secondly, our imbalances are small. We also have a large current ac-count surplus. When the economy reverses – as it will, although we do not know how and when – domestic factors need not trigger a deep re-cession. But there are major external risks linked to the procyclical fiscal boost in the USA, something as old-fashioned as trade restrictions, as well as weaknesses and, perhaps, experiments in several European coun-tries and emerging markets.  Thirdly, we have capacity pressures, but so far without inflation. This can lead to loss of market shares, but we cannot produce more than our la-bour resources permit. There are signs that this pressure is affecting productivity. We must take care, but the situation is not as bad as it was during the upswings in the mid-1980s and mid-2000s. Fourthly, times are also good in the financial sector, although risks are increasing. Far into the upswing, interest rates remain very low, there are a number of international risks, and there is fierce competition to provide loans in a low-demand market. It is time for a larger countercyclical cap-ital buffer. We have a sound real economy with buffers, but there is limit-ed scope for reducing interest rates and providing fiscal stimuli next time the economy goes into recession. When that happens, the financial sec-tor cannot and should not be part of the problem. International cooperation under pressure Now I will turn my attention to international cooperation. We are fortu-nate to live in an age of rule-based international organisations set up by a few forward-looking generations that came just before ours.  In the field of economics, the IMF, the World Bank, the WTO, the OECD, the EU and the euro project should be highlighted. These institutions have treaties and statutes, governing bodies representing all member states, voting rules, tools for further development and settlement of dis-putes, and courts of law and rulings with equal treatment. It ought to be self-evident why rule-based cooperation is a good idea for everyone, and especially for small and medium-sized countries. Unless they choose isolation, they would otherwise have to approach the largest and strongest countries one by one, on a case-by-case basis, and then adhere 
  Side 3 af 9 to the standards set by the largest and strongest countries. Settlement of disputes would be dependent on the goodwill of the various large coun-tries. It requires vision, outlook and a long time horizon for large countries to commit to rule-based cooperation, as they will have to give up some ac-tual decision-making power. They have to argue their cases, they may find themselves in a minority in concrete voting situations, and in legal dispute resolution the rules apply, not the sizes and short-term interests of the parties. So why did the large countries choose not only to partici-pate, but also to lead the way when setting up these institutions? Pre-sumably it helped a little that binding cooperation is fair and intellectually satisfactory. But a much more decisive factor has probably been that, in economic terms, it is far more efficient for everyone, and the alternative is political chaos, with anarchy, shifting and random alliances and eternal conflicts, not least between large countries. Seen from our perspective, as a small country, rule-based cooperation has to some extent been challenged by institutions with the major powers as members – such as the G7, G20, FSB (Financial Stability Board) and Basel Committee – for they do not operate with treaty rules and equal treatment, and furthermore we are not invited to join them. On the other hand, they are more concerned with coordination and advice rather than direct deci-sion-making. The EU and the ECB sit at the table and serve as buffers in re-lation to implementation. And perhaps it is just as well that the largest countries meet up in smaller forums and have an opportunity to avoid frus-trations they may have in the rule-based institutions where they need to negotiate with many other large and small countries. It is more serious if large countries withdraw from existing agreements, prevent the rule-based institutions from working efficiently or go solo and test the limits of or act in direct contravention of the written or un-written rules of the institutions. Or if medium-sized and small countries individually get the notion that they will be able to decide more them-selves by withdrawing from the institutions. In this case they face a diffi-cult choice. Either they must follow the rules laid down by others – with-out having any influence on them. Or they must accept the loss of pros-perity and the hassle imposed on the government, businesses and citi-zens from opting for isolation and their own rules, plus harvest possible windfalls that may come in the form of bilateral agreements. Unfortunate-ly, there are topical examples of both situations, and in some countries there is pressure to follow suit. This also poses a risk to Danish prosperity and influence. It is important to keep the value of broad international co-
  Side 4 af 9 operation in mind, also when focusing (more narrowly) on issues such as the banking union, and the implications if Denmark at some point de-cides to join it. The development of the banking union  The banking union is not fully developed and is not likely ever to be. There will always be new issues and proposals to consider. But the largest and most important pieces have fallen into place with the Single Supervisory Mechanism and the Single Resolution Board, both of which are function-ing.  The participants are currently discussing the collaboration under the heading of "risk reduction and risk sharing. The heading is not well-chosen, as it gives an impression of a "quid pro quo" mindset. In reality, the "discussion" comprises a number of elements that are all well-founded, also when viewed separately. The discussion has been organised, e.g. via the development of a set of indicators for the soundness of the banking sector. These may be of sep-arate interest, but will also be used as criteria for the development of the potential European Deposit Insurance Scheme, EDIS – which I will return to later. Risk reduction As in this country, banks in the rest of Europe are also benefiting from the stronger economy and the efforts to clear up the mess left by the crisis.  Return on equity has risen despite a slightly depressed interest margin, but with considerable variation between member states. The German banks stand out with relatively low earnings. There has been consolida-tion within the sector, as also seen in Denmark. The European banks are better capitalised. This is because they hold more capital, but also because their risk weights have fallen. (This reflects an improved cyclical position and better credit management, but also the discontinuation of weak banks and divestment of non-performing loans.) Liabilities are also being issued to meet the MREL (Minimum Requirement for own funds and Eligible Liabilities). Observance of the MREL is to en-sure that eligible liabilities can be written down or converted into equity in a reasonably orderly manner if the institution is failing and is systemic-ally important. In that case, it must be recapitalised and continued in a new form. It will take some years before the MREL is fully built up. In 
  Side 5 af 9 Denmark we have also begun to build up MREL funds, although no MREL requirement yet applies to mortgage banks, as you will know. As regards liquidity, it has been agreed to apply the two liquidity ratios, LCR and NSFR1, as indicators.  The LCR has, on average, increased considerably in most member states, and the distance to the 100 per cent requirement is increasing. The NSFR requirements are also generally met. The spread in the share of non-performing loans has been a significant barrier in relation to encouraging the economically strong member states to engage in more risk sharing. In terms of legislation and practise, the ability and willingness of member states to realise the underlying assets and collateral pledged for non-performing loans, e.g. in the form of en-forced sale, also differ. This is to a considerable extent politically or cul-turally motivated. The volume of non-performing loans has fallen in most member states, and they have to a larger extent been taken into account in the banks' financial statements, e.g. in the form of impairment charges. All in all, the indicators show a clear improvement in the banks' sound-ness. As regards capital adequacy and liquidity, the EU requirements are generally met. The situation in relation to non-performing loans is im-proving, but further improvements are required in some member states.  Risk sharing in perspective What is more important than current indicators of banks' soundness – which may change – is the ability to understand and interpret the institu-tions that are already or may at some point be involved in risk sharing between banks and government finances across member states. An in-surance element of this kind may be useful when handling specific crises as it may reduce spillover effects between banks in crisis-ridden member states. And it can reduce interdependence between banks and the gov-ernments of their home countries. On the other hand, it may seem unfair and may even increase institutions' risk appetite if taxpayers or banks in other member states are liable for the consequences of decisions and risk-taking beyond their control.                                                      1 The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (cf. the EU Capital Requirements Regulation) and the Net Stable Funding Ratio (cf. the current proposal to amend the EU Capital Requirements Regulation, which has not yet been adopted). 
  Side 6 af 9 Both views can be justified. But it is a fact that the decisions made within the union show a strong aversion to risk-sharing and to some partici-pants – banks or sovereign states – being liable for incidents or decisions made in other member states. This can be illustrated from four different angles.  My first example is the loan programmes for crisis-ridden member states from the IMF2 and the ESM3. Especially the Greek programme has been in focus in recent years. These loans are intergovernmental and extend far beyond the banks, but they are, in principle, interesting in relation to understanding the dominant European mindset that applies, also in the banking union. That is why I will elaborate a little on this issue. My point is that the programmes consist of loans and liquidity support, subject to spe-cific terms and conditions. They have involved neither direct nor indirect fiscal transfers. Today these programmes are seen as a success, although the picture of a Greek recovery is still somewhat blurred, which is hardly surprising. After all, it took several decades before Denmark had fully re-covered from the situation in the early 1980s, when the economic chal-lenges in some respects resembled those faced by Greece today. The debts of Greece have been written down, but only for private-sector creditors. The interest terms have been very accommodative and Greece annually saves several per cent of GDP on its government interest pay-ments. For example, Portugal's interest expenses are higher, even though its debt is lower. But the interest rate has not been lower than that at which the IMF and ESM have been able to borrow in the market. The principals of the loans have not been reduced. Instalments and interest payments have been postponed considerably, but have not been written down. There has been a reduction in the margin lenders add to their fi-nancing costs, and there is a possibility that the ECB will waive its profit on market purchases of Greek government bonds, but again there have not been any fiscal transfers from other member states. In the international press, increased write-down of debt, also to other governments, has been called for. But write-down of government lending is a fiscal transfer, and there are good reasons why this has not taken place. In that situation, taxpayers in the lender states would feel that they were bearing the costs of decisions made in borrower states – decisions                                                     2 The IMF, International Monetary Fund, established in 1944. The IMF today has 189 member countries and a lending capacity of around 1,000 billion dollars. 3 The ESM, European Stability Mechanism, established by the euro area member states in 2012 as an intergov-ernmental institution. The ESM has a lending capacity of 500 billion euro. 
  Side 7 af 9 that they could not influence. This would provide a basis for political con-flicts in and between member states. Taxpayers and the government of the borrower state would have a joint incentive to ease fiscal plans if others were ultimately to foot the bill. And it may be difficult to raise government loans for other crisis-ridden member states in future if they can subse-quently be converted into income transfers. Fiscal transfers can be perceived as "taxation without representation". And there is a legitimate need for member states to be allowed to test their own policies and hence also to bear the consequences. A balance is struck because there is a common fiscal framework which is discussed on an ongoing basis. The rules are politically rather than legally binding. Can it be simplified? It is doubtful. Does it work? Yes, when member states use it as support for sound policies rather than making it a scapegoat. So it solves some, but not all, problems. Nor can the banking union be ex-pected to solve all problems. Backstoppers are the assistance programmes that impose strict condi-tions on the borrowers. This will always be controversial, but the re-quirements are milder than the conditions and interest rates that a crisis-ridden member state may obtain on market terms. Another example is the crisis management of individual banks in recent years, e.g. in Italy and Spain. It should be remembered that although the BRRD/SRMR4 rules apply, the build-up of MREL funds has by no means been completed yet. In the most controversial cases, the EU institutions assessed that the banks concerned were not systemically important in a Community context, and the further management of these banks was left to the national authorities. Those authorities then insisted that the banks had regional systemic importance and obtained the approval of the Euro-pean Commission for measures with an element of state aid that does, to some extent, distort competition. If this indicates a flaw in the system, it lies not in the banking union but in the general EU rules on state aid, which might be criticised for not having been brought in line with the BRRD. However, there has not been any talk about using shared funds in connection with crisis management by e.g. the SRF. The measures taken have been at the expense of the relevant member state itself.                                                     4 The BRRD, Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive, and the corresponding rules for euro area member states, the SRMR, Single Resolution Mechanism Regulation, both adopted in 2014. 
  Side 8 af 9 A third example is contributions from the SRF, the Single Resolution Fund financed by the banks. They are incredibly well protected. SRF funds can be used only after bail-in of the equivalent of 8 per cent of the liabilities of a failing bank. This typically corresponds to 25 per cent of the risk-weighted assets. Calculations show that during the crisis period after 2008 only one systemically important European bank had losses exceed-ing this threshold. Furthermore, contributions from the SRF may not ex-ceed 5 per cent of the bank's liabilities, and it is a receivable claim, not an income transfer.  This structure is a result of a more fundamental shift (with the BRRD) in the approach to financial regulation after the financial crisis, to the effect that crisis resolution of failing banks should take place using owner and creditor funds. This shift may initially have been aimed at preventing the use of government funds, but it has also significantly reduced the oppor-tunity to use funds collected from other banks. In other words, the cross-border insurance element has been overtaken by a healthier crisis reso-lution model. The fourth example is the EDIS, in relation to which negotiations have been slow. In objective terms, there is a good case for a single deposit insurance scheme in a banking union. The risks of national banks are con-tinuously affected by national conditions, but with single supervisory and resolution mechanisms it is natural also to have a single deposit insur-ance scheme. But supporters and opponents seem to exaggerate the re-spective pros and cons of such a scheme.  Possibly a single deposit insurance scheme will have a stabilising psycho-logical effect on the depositors of potentially failing banks. But people tend to overlook the fact that creditor legislation has been amended so that deposits in general and covered deposits in particular rank first in the creditor hierarchy. So the Deposit Guarantee Fund can be invoked only after extremely large losses in a bank, including loss of all senior debt and uninsured deposits. Hence, the relevance of EDIS is linked to banks funded almost exclusively by deposits covered by a deposit guar-antee. We should also note that the ECB in the spring published an inter-esting analysis5 showing that even far deeper crises than the one in 2008-09 would not be able to deplete a fully phased-in deposit insurance fund of 0.8 per cent of covered deposits. Underlying reasons include the credi-                                                    5 ECB Occasional Paper 208, April 2018: Completing the Banking Union with a European Deposit Insurance Scheme: Who is afraid of cross-subsidisation? 
  Side 9 af 9 tor preference for deposits and the build-up of MREL funds. Overall, the system has now been structured in such a way that deposit insurance schemes – be they national or European – will in practice play a very limit-ed role in the resolution of failing banks. Concluding remarks about the banking union There are a number of other, strong, arguments in favour of participating in the banking union, including: further development of the single market with more competition, for the benefit of consumers and firms at home and the ability of banks to operate in other member states. Stronger supervisory powers in terms of capacity, depth, methods and the oppor-tunity to take a broader perspective. Better management of cross-border financial activities. Greater credibility in relation to the bail-in rules, and greater certainty that failing banks will be treated in the same way. And like all other international cooperation for a small country: influence on rules and practices that must, in effect, be observed in any case – includ-ing having a spokesperson in institutions such as Basel and the FSB, where we are not invited to sit at the table ourselves. And after all, the vast majority of Danish banks are of a size which would place them under direct Danish supervision, also in a banking union. But based on the sin-gle supervisory practice – which has its advantages.  As you will have understood, the insurance element is not at the core of the banking union. An insurance element does exist for use in extreme situations with failing banks, but otherwise its role will be very limited. So the insurance element and its counterpart – fear of liability for problems incurred by banks in other member states – are neither key arguments for participating in nor remaining outside the banking union. I am not claiming that transfers between the EU member states do not and should not exist. Transfers have taken place for many years, via the EU budget, and the amounts are considerable. Several member states receive up to 3 per cent of their GDP on the basis of a number of object-ive and structural criteria. So it would not be new or exceptional if other elements of the cooperation were also to include such transfers. But nei-ther the euro project nor the banking union have involved or envisage transfers between member states to any substantial degree. And in prac-tice, the institutions are systematically designed to minimise the likeli-hood of such transfers. That will probably characterise also future devel-opments within this area.  
Peter Praet: Creating an enabling environment for pan-Europeanbanks in the Banking UnionRemarks by Mr Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, atthe Eurofi Financial Forum 2018, Vienna, 5 September 2018.*   *   *In recent years, the European Union has achieved major progress towards financialintegration. We now have a single supervisor and a single resolution authority, and banks aresubject to the same European rulebook. The Banking Union contributes to providing effectivemechanisms for cross-border risk-sharing and broadening the sources of funding within acountry, thereby promoting macroeconomic stability and growth.However, we still observe a number of obstacles that hinder the fungibility of capital andliquidity of banking groups. Very often, these obstacles relate to regulatory fragmentation andring-fencing of national markets. Further harmonisation would help to address many of theissues, while appropriate prudential safeguards can be put in place to address possible financialstability concerns by national authorities.First, a number of national options and discretions are hindering the practical applicationof cross-border liquidity waivers within the Union. While such waivers are explicitly allowedby the CRR, and already contain prudential safeguards, so far the ECB has received almost noapplication for their use from the banks it supervises. An important reason for this lack ofapplications is the existence of national large exposure limits on intragroup exposures in severalEuropean countries. These limits prevent institutions in these countries from transferring liquiditywithin the group in a flexible manner and thus represent practical obstacles to the use of liquiditywaivers. Effectively, they are hindering the free flow of liquidity in the Banking Union and shouldbe harmonised further.Second, the proposal to have cross-border capital waivers within the EU was not takenforward in the on-going review of the CRR, which is a missed opportunity. Such waiverswould be consistent with the establishment of the SSM and the Banking Union and help tosupport the free flow of capital across the Union. On the one hand, it is understandable thatsome national authorities are concerned about the possible financial stability implications of theproposal. On the other hand, such concerns could be addressed by making the waivers subjectto additional prudential safeguards, and by putting in place appropriate transition arrangementsthat account for the planned further progress on the Banking Union.Third, the major progress we have made in our Banking Union needs to be recognisedalso in the international regulatory framework. For example, the G-SIB framework currentlypenalises cross-border transactions within the Banking Union by attaching a higher systemic riskscore to banks with more of such transactions. This goes against the very rationale of theBanking Union, as it reduces the incentives for cross-border transactions and risk diversification.The international regulatory framework should recognise the progress that has been made in theBanking Union and exclude intra Banking Union positions from the cross-jurisdictional indicatorsin the G-SIB methodology.Fourth, there are also some resolution related aspects that warrant furtherconsideration. In particular, the allocation of internal MREL has turned out to be an area oftension between national jurisdictions. Jurisdictions with a foreign bank subsidiary prefer to havea high pre-positioning of internal MREL to ensure an orderly resolution of its local subsidiary.However, this implies a certain degree of ring-fencing to the detriment of the foreign parent bank.The compromise reached by Member States in the Council only allows that internal MREL is 1 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
waived if the resolution entity and the subsidiary are located in the same Member State,neglecting the fact that we have achieved so much in terms of joint supervision and resolutionamong euro area countries. To account for this progress, internal MREL waivers on a cross-border basis in the Banking Union should be allowed as this would contribute to continuouscross-border banking, e.g. by generating efficiency gains and promoting further integration.Therefore, it should also be possible to use guarantees to replace internal MREL and allow formore flexibility in the allocation of resources within the Banking Union. Of course, to installconfidence it will be important to have adequate safeguards in place, including that there is nolegal or practical impediments to the provision of support by the parent to the subsidiary, inparticular when the resolution action is taken. 2 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
Philip R Lane: Macro-financial risk managementRemarks by Mr Philip R Lane, Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, at the Central BankEconomics Roundtable, Dublin, 5 September 2018.*   *   *IntroductionIn opening our annual economics roundtable, let me focus on macro-financial risk management.At a country level, macro-financial risks are managed by both the regulatory policies of thecentral bank and national fiscal policy. In these introductory remarks, I will address bothdimensions.As outlined in our latest Quarterly Bulletin, the Irish economy is currently in a phase of strongeconomic performance. We project employment to grow by 2.6 per cent in 2018 and 1.9 per centin 2019. The 20.4 percent cumulative increase in employment from 2011 Q3 through to 2018 Q2has been enabled by a decline in unemployment from 15.9 per cent (2011 Q4) to 5.8 per cent(2018 Q2), together with an increase in the participation rate and inward migration. Importantly,the current growth has not been fueled by an unsustainable increase in domestic credit; inaddition, it does not rely on net financial inflows: the adjusted current account measure is closeto zero.At the same time, there are clear downside risks facing the economy. First, an unexpectedtightening in international financial conditions (relative to the benign environment that has been inplace for an extended period of time) through an upward revision in risk premia or term premiacould induce an international slowdown in investment and consumption, together with anadjustment in asset values in financial markets, the commercial real estate sector and housingmarkets. Second, shifts in international trade and tax regimes that adversely affect the Irishbusiness model constitute important tail risks, even if these risks are hard to calibrate. Third, adisorderly Brexit would pose immediate challenges for the Irish economy and financial system.Given this current configuration of risks, macro-financial risk management has two aims. First,policy actions should not amplify pro-cyclical dynamics, if overheatings risks in the economy andthe financial system are to be contained. Second, macro-financial resilience is enhanced ifbuffers can be built during good times that will enable Ireland to cope more easily with futuredownside shocks.In implementing this policy agenda, I will first turn to the regulatory policies of the Central Bank,before turning to the role of fiscal policy.Financial Regulation During Good Times: The Macro-Prudential Stance and SupervisoryPrioritiesAs the national macroprudential authority, the Central Bank is mandated to implement measuresto prevent excessive credit growth and leverage at a system-wide level. In line with this mandate,the Central Bank recently activated the counter-cyclical capital buffer, which is expresslydesigned to manage cyclical risks. By requiring additional capital buffers during cyclicalupswings, the banking system will be better prepared for future downturns. In particular, in theevent of an adverse shock, this capital buffer can be released, thereby mitigating the damagingpro-cyclical withdrawal of credit supply under adverse conditions.In relation to new mortgage lending, our borrower-based measures that impose (flexible) ceilingson loan-to-income (LTI) and loan-to-value (LTV) ratios have built-in features that limit pro-cyclicaldynamics. In the absence of such ceilings, cyclically-strong economic conditions mightotherwise drive mortgage market dynamics towards more aggressive LTI and LTV ratios due to 1 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
upward revisions (by lenders and borrowers) in projections of future levels of house prices andincomes. In addition, by limiting the risks of over-borrowing by households and over-lending bybanks, household and bank balance sheets should be more resilient in the event of a futuredownturn. In relation to supervisory priorities, the current upturn in the European economy also provides anopportunity to address legacy issues such as the excessive stock of non-performing loans(NPLs) that accumulated in the wake of the crisis. In terms of timing, benign economic andfinancial conditions make it easier to identify feasible solutions for troubled loans in terms of therepayment capacity of debtors, the value of collateral and the market appetite for loan portfoliotransactions. While the tackling of NPLs is a pan-European supervisory priority, it has particularimportance in countries such as Ireland that experienced the most severe increases in troubledloans in the wake of the crisis.While the direct restructuring of troubled loans by banks plays a vital role (and, indeed, has beenextensively deployed in the Irish banking system in recent years), the sale of loan portfolios isalso an important element in macro-financial risk management. In particular, the reduction in thesize of bank balance sheets (especially through holding a lower stock of NPLs) limits financialstability risk in the event of a future downturn, in terms of the scale of potential losses and fundingchallenges. In terms of risk management, the transfer of credit risk and funding risk to theinvestment funds that buy loan portfolios constitutes a national reduction in macro-financial risk,given that the investors in these funds are primarily overseas.It is critical to stress, however, that the sale of such portfolios cannot – and does not – affectstatutory consumer safeguards. The Central Bank applies itself equally to its twin mandate ofsafeguarding stability and protecting consumers. Accordingly, the Central Bank is committed toensuring that loan sales do not affect the consumer protection framework governing mortgages.In particular, loan owners must use a regulated credit servicing firm to manage the loans andthese firms are subject to the same codes of conduct as banks and retail credit firms. In addition,we are currently reviewing the code of conduct on mortgage arrears (CCMA), in order to ensurethat it is appropriately designed to address current conduct risks in the handling of troubledmortgages, regardless of the identities of the loan owners. While that review is ongoing, it isworth noting the important role that the CCMA and related safeguards have played to date inassisting borrowers in difficulty. To end-March this year, more than 117,000 principal-dwellinghouse mortgage accounts have been restructured, with 86 percent meeting the terms of therestructured arrangement.In relation to ongoing supervision, the positive economic climate across Europe has beenaccompanied by a gradual expansion in credit provision. Especially during phases of creditgrowth, it is essential that supervisors insist that risk management and governance frameworksare appropriately designed and consistently implemented if credit and operational risks are to becontained. Maintaining confidence in the management and governance standards of banks isessential for financial stability, given the intrinsic opacity of loan portfolios and the dominant roleof non-equity investors (senior and subordinated bond holders, wholesale investors, non-guaranteed large depositors) in the funding of banks. Accordingly, while shareholders (private orpublic) play a vital role in the governance of banks, the leveraged nature of banks means that thestability of the financial system requires that all banks adhere to high risk management andgovernance standards.Fiscal Policy Over the CycleIn line with the mandate of the Central Bank to provide analysis and comment to support nationaleconomic policy development, the governor writes an annual pre-budget advisory letter to theminister for finance. In this section, I explain the advice I offer in this year’s letter, which ispublished today.  2 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
As a general rule, the running of budget surpluses during phases of strong economicperformance is a precondition for the running of stabilising, counter-cyclical fiscal deficits in theevent of a future downturn. If fiscal buffers are not built up, there is a risk of repeating thehistorical patterns by which economic downturns have been amplified by pro-cyclical fiscalausterity.There are three further reasons to set more ambitious fiscal targets in the current environment.First, it cannot be ruled out that the surge in corporation tax revenues may have some temporaryelements, indicating that some part of these revenues should be categorised as a windfall.Second, to the extent that the current low interest rate environment is not expected to persistindefinitely, a tighter non-interest budget balance offers protection against future increases indebt servicing costs. Third, the legacy of high public and private debt levels mean that Ireland isrelatively more vulnerable to reversals compared to other countries with less-leveraged publicand private balance sheets.In addition to striking the cyclically-appropriate fiscal balance, individual fiscal levers cancontribute to macro-financial stabilisation, especially for a country in a monetary union. Forinstance, raising the VAT rate on labour-intensive activities during upturns proxies the stabilisingrole of exchange rate appreciation, while raising taxes on investment and consumption duringphases of strong growth substitutes for the cyclical role played by an interest rate hike in anindependent monetary regime. Symmetrically, these taxes can be cyclically lowered during afuture downturn to provide similar support that would be provided by currency devaluation andinterest rate reductions under an independent currency.ConclusionsIn closing, my aim in these introductory remarks has been to describe the current agenda formacro-financial risk management. The current economic performance is very welcome – but it isimportant to be pro-active in mitigating pro-cyclical dynamics and building up buffers to limit thecosts of future downturns. As I have outlined, both regulatory policies and fiscal policy haveessential roles to play in macro-financial risk management. 3 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
Hitoshi Suzuki Member of the Policy Board Economic Activity, Prices,  and Monetary Policy in Japan  Speech at a Meeting with Business Leaders in Okinawa Bank of Japan August 29, 2018 (English translation based on the Japanese original) 
1 I. Recent Economic and Price Developments A. Overseas Economies I would like to begin my speech by talking about overseas economies.  Overseas economies have continued to grow firmly on the whole, although the global business sentiment of manufacturing firms has declined somewhat recently.    As for the U.S. economy, business sentiment has been favorable and private consumption has been on an increasing trend, partly supported by improvements in the employment and income situation, as well as in consumer sentiment. In terms of the outlook, the U.S. economy is expected to continue expanding on the back of a steady improvement in the employment and income situation, supported by expansionary fiscal policy, although moderate policy rate hikes by the Federal Reserve are expected to continue.  As for the European economy, the pace of economic growth decelerated somewhat, due mainly to the appreciation of the euro and weather conditions throughout the January-March quarter of 2018. It decelerated further in the April-June quarter, although production has been increasing as a trend, and the overall economy is expected to continue its recovery.  The Chinese economy has continued to see stable growth on the whole, as evidenced by firm exports and industrial production, although the pace of increase in fixed asset investment has been slowing and the effects of trade friction with the United States have been a matter of concern. As for the outlook, the economy is likely to broadly follow a stable growth path as the authorities conduct fiscal and monetary policy in a timely manner.   Emerging economies other than China and commodity-exporting economies as a whole have been recovering moderately, due mainly to an increase in exports and the effects of economic stimulus measures. Growth rates are likely to increase gradually, due mainly to economic stimulus measures and the spread of the effects of steady growth in advanced economies. 
2 According to the July 2018 World Economic Outlook (WEO) Update released by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), global growth is projected to be 3.9 percent in 2018, exceeding the result for 2017. The global economy could deviate upward from the baseline scenario depending on developments in fiscal and monetary policies and structural reforms in each country (Chart 1). However, due attention should be paid to the recent gradual heightening of uncertainties that could pose a downside risk to economic activity. Specifically, there is concern that U.S. protectionist trade policy and other countries' retaliatory measures may trigger a decline in world trade volume and have an impact on global financial markets. In addition, close attention should continue to be paid to negotiations on the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union (EU), as well as the political situation in southern Europe, developments in crude oil prices, geopolitical risks, and deceleration in the Chinese economy.  On this point, in emerging economies, while their U.S. dollar-denominated external debt has expanded over the past decade, a number of negative factors have been observed, such as the rise in U.S. interest rates, depreciation of these economies' currencies that would have been used for the repayment of debts, and deceleration of the economy as a result of interest rate hikes aimed at containing inflation and defending the currencies. Although the effect on the global economy seems to be limited at this point, it is important to keep a close eye on developments.   B. Current Situation and Outlook for Japan's Economy I will now discuss the economic situation in Japan. Japan's economy is expanding moderately, with the output gap maintained in excess demand and a virtuous cycle from income to spending operating (Chart 2). Although the real GDP growth rate for the January-March quarter of 2018 registered a temporary negative figure, due mainly to weather conditions, the preliminary estimate for the April-June quarter showed clear, positive growth mainly on the back of a recovery in private consumption and acceleration in the rate of increase in business fixed investment (Chart 3).   According to the Regional Economic Report released by the Bank of Japan in July 2018, out of a total of nine regions across Japan, six regions, including the Kyushu-Okinawa 
3 region, reported that their economy had been expanding or expanding moderately (Chart 4). The Kyushu-Okinawa economy in particular has been expanding moderately, with growth gaining a more solid footing, as private consumption has increased. This increase comes on the back of an improvement in the employment and income situation amid high levels of public investment and increasing business fixed investment. In Okinawa Prefecture, inbound tourism consumption and business fixed investment in the private sector, including the construction of new hotels, have been increasing amid the rising trend in the number of domestic and international tourists, despite a temporary fall in the number brought about by typhoons in July. These represent the driving force for the growth of Okinawa's economy.  With Japan's economic expansion, supply-demand conditions in the labor market have tightened steadily. Firms' perception of a labor shortage suggested by the diffusion indexes (DIs) for employment conditions in the June 2018 Tankan (Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan) has heightened in a wide range of industries, and the unemployment rate has declined to about 2.5 percent. The overall active job openings-to-applicants ratio has been at its highest level since 1974, while the ratio for full-time workers specifically was the highest recorded since that survey began, in November 2004 (Chart 5).  Against this backdrop, labor-saving investment has increased in a wide range of industries with a view to, for example, using artificial intelligence (AI), robotic process automation (RPA), and other means. As the use of AI and RPA increases, the displacement effect caused by the labor positions of humans being taken over by robots and machines will be an issue of concern. However, I believe the use of AI and RPA could contribute to further overall economic growth, through cost reductions brought about by automation, as well as through the creation of new employment in the production of new goods and services resulting from technological innovation. As Japan has been tackling the challenge of a declining birth rate and an aging population, the contribution of AI and RPA to further economic growth could be a key to solving this challenge. Indeed, there is research that analyzes both positive and negative effects of the use of AI and suggests challenges that the society should work on.1                                                     1 Acemoglu, Daron, and Pascual Restrepo.

4 With regard to the outlook, Japan's economy is likely to continue its moderate expansion.  Through fiscal 2018, it is likely to continue growing at a pace above its potential, mainly against the background of highly accommodative financial conditions and the underpinnings through government spending, with overseas economies continuing to grow firmly. Business fixed investment is likely to continue increasing, supported by firms' heightened growth expectations and increases in Olympic Games-related investment, as well as in labor-saving investment to address labor shortages. Private consumption is also expected to follow a moderate increasing trend as the employment and income situation continues to improve. Moreover, exports are expected to continue their moderate increasing trend on the back of the growth in overseas economies.   Japan's economy is expected to maintain its expanding trend from fiscal 2019 through fiscal 2020, supported in part by the increase in exports. This is despite a likely deceleration in business fixed investment, mainly reflecting cyclical adjustments in capital stock and the peaking out of Olympic Games-related demand, and a likely temporary decline in private consumption after the scheduled consumption tax hike in October 2019.   According to the Bank's July 2018 Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (hereafter the Outlook Report), the medians of the Policy Board members' forecasts of the real GDP growth rate are 1.5 percent for fiscal 2018, and 0.8 percent for both fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 (Chart 6). The consumption tax hike is likely to affect Japan's economy through the following two channels: (1) the front-loaded increase in demand prior to the consumption tax hike and the subsequent decline after the hike, and (2) the decline in real income. However, there is a strong possibility that the effect of the consumption tax hike on the economy will be smaller than that in fiscal 2014, when the last consumption tax hike took place. This is mainly because the government is proceeding with efforts to deliberate various measures in order to reduce the burden of the tax hike on households.  C. Recent Price Developments and Concept of Price Stability Target As for prices, the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI) for all items less fresh food (core CPI) has been picking up somewhat recently, partly supported by 
5 a rise in energy prices, although it did decelerate on one occasion after having increased to 1 percent in February 2018 (Chart 7).  Prices reflect the state of the economy. A stable increase in prices within a certain range -- not too high, not too low -- can be a driving force for the economy. To give an example, in an environment where prices rise moderately -- through an increase in the value-added of products and services -- corporate profits are likely to increase. In this case, the wages of people working in firms also would rise, as would household income. With increased household income, people are likely to spend more on products and services, making corporate profits increase even more. I consider it important to ensure that this virtuous cycle can operate.   What, then, is the most favorable state for the economy? The Bank sets what it calls the "price stability target" at 2 percent. There are three reasons for setting the target at 2 percent.   First, the CPI has a statistical tendency, or upward bias, toward indicating a slightly higher inflation rate than the actual one, which means that an appropriate figure for price stability in terms of the CPI is a slightly positive figure.   Second, there is the asymmetry of policy measures. Central banks usually respond to inflation and deflation by raising or lowering policy interest rates. They can more or less raise interest rates to as high a level as they feel necessary; there is basically no ceiling to interest rates. On the other hand, there is a limit to the extent to which interest rates can be lowered. It is therefore prudent to have a buffer to secure a certain "margin" of positive inflation and positive interest rates in advance, so that central banks can take appropriate action through monetary easing if the economy heads toward deflation.   Third, most major advanced economies define price stability as 2 percent, and this is the target shared as a global standard.   
6 In short, the appropriate state for the economy is similar to that of the human body; it is important to maintain the target as the "basal temperature" of the economy, and this is the consensus of the central banks in major advanced economies.   D. Key Factors for Prices and Wages Now, I would like to explain the developments for prices and wages, taking into account those in the output gap and medium- to long-term inflation expectations.   The first point is developments in the output gap. The output gap has widened within positive territory on the back of the steady tightening of labor market conditions and a rise in capital utilization rates. In theory, an expansion of the output gap should exert upward pressure on prices, which would then increase core CPI, albeit with some time lag. However, in reality, prices have not been increasing as they should. Part of the reason that prices have remained sluggish is households' persistent concern regarding the future amid the declining birth rate and aging population, in addition to the fact that wage increases have been taking time to fully take hold, as I will touch upon later. Frankly speaking, consumers are still keeping their purse strings tight. In other words, households' tolerance of price rises has not been increasing. Indeed, some firms, mainly in the services sector, such as transportation and dining out, have been raising prices since autumn 2017, reflecting increases in the cost of labor and materials. Price rises also have been seen since the beginning of 2018 in goods including beer for consumption in licensed premises and some food items. However, there have not been many cases so far where such efforts have led to an improvement in corporate profits, and many firms appear to be having difficulty with accurately assessing consumer sentiment. These issues seem to be related to firms' cautious price-setting stance. Improving the income situation by raising wages would be the most direct approach to reducing households' concerns regarding the future. However, it is also important to redesign safety nets with which the public can feel more secure, through frameworks such as pensions and other components of the social security system.  Regarding wages, the increase in nominal wages has been sluggish relative to the heightening seriousness of the labor shortage. This may be because regular employees tend to give priority to stability of employment over wage increases, and firms are maintaining 
7 their cautious wage-setting stance in consideration of medium- to long-term risks. Amid the intensifying labor shortage, there also has been an increase in the labor force participation of women and seniors, whose wage elasticity of the labor supply is high.   Real wages, which exclude the effects of price developments, also have been sluggish under these circumstances. If prices rise without an increase in wages, a burden might be placed on the national economy. Therefore, the Bank's goal is not necessarily solely to raise prices, but also to continue to closely monitor developments in wages if it is to achieve the price stability target and thereby contribute to the sound development of the economy.  The next point concerns medium- to long-term inflation expectations, which are more or less unchanged recently (Chart 8). Theoretically, inflation expectations are affected by (1) the backward-looking, or adaptive, component that reflects past rates, or the observed inflation rate, and (2) the forward-looking component, which reflects the progress in the Bank's pursuit of monetary easing through its strong commitment to achieving the price stability target. While promoting a rise in the observed inflation rate, given that inflation expectations in Japan tend to be more greatly influenced by the observed inflation rate, it is vital that the Bank maintain its strong commitment to achieving the price stability target. If firms' and households' inflation expectations subsequently rise, albeit gradually, this will feed through into the observed inflation rate, which in turn will bring about a gradual increase in the inflation rate.  Due to a combination of the several factors mentioned so far, prices have continued to show relatively weak developments compared to the improvement in the economic and employment conditions. However, it is also true that the year-on-year rate of change in the core CPI was either more or less flat or increasing for 19 consecutive months up to February 2018.  It is better not to be too optimistic about the outlook, but many of the factors that have been delaying inflation are likely to be resolved gradually as the economy continues on an expanding trend. Firms' moves to raise wages have gradually begun to spread, as suggested by the results of the annual spring labor-management wage negotiations in 2018. Although 
8 the effects of technological progress, for example, may strengthen, the increase in wages is expected to become more evident, with tight labor market conditions continuing. Upward pressure on sales prices is thereby likely to increase, as is happening in the services sector, such as dining out, and an increase in distribution costs resulting from labor shortage may ease competition between retailers and online retailers.   Households' tolerance of price rises is also expected to increase as the effects of rises in labor productivity and non-regular employees' wage levels spread to regular employees' wages.  I mentioned earlier that medium- to long-term inflation expectations are more or less unchanged, but results of the Opinion Survey on the General Public's Views and Behavior released by the Bank show that the proportion of respondents who answered that prices would go up one year from now has been on an increasing trend -- indicating a change in people's perception of prices (Chart 9).   These points suggest that, while not yet sufficiently firm, the momentum toward achieving the price stability target is itself being maintained, and the year-on-year rate of change in the core CPI is likely to increase gradually toward 2 percent, although it will take more time than expected. Specifically, the medians of the Policy Board members' forecasts for the year-on-year rate of change in the core CPI presented in the July 2018 Outlook Report are 1.1 percent for fiscal 2018, and, excluding the direct effects of the scheduled consumption tax hike, 1.5 percent and 1.6 percent for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020, respectively (Chart 6).  II. Conduct of Monetary Policy A. Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control Let me now turn to the Bank's monetary policy. Following the introduction of QQE in April 2013, the Bank has been pursuing QQE with Yield Curve Control since September 2016, through which it has strengthened the framework of QQE.  By controlling short- and long-term interest rates -- the so-called yield curve control -- the Bank facilitates the formation of the yield curve, or term structure of interest rates, most 
9 appropriate for achieving the price stability target of 2 percent. In theory, economic activity is stimulated by maintaining observed real interest rates, which are obtained by subtracting inflation expectations from the nominal interest rate, at lower levels than the natural rate of interest, which is the real interest rate at which the economy neither accelerates nor decelerates; as the output gap improves, upward pressure on prices is generated. This is the mechanism that the Bank assumes will operate.  There is still some way to go to achieving the price stability target, due to the various factors I mentioned earlier. Let me note, however, that Japan's economy has continued expanding, as the effects of monetary easing have thoroughly demonstrated. In this situation, I believe that the path to a rise in wages and prices is starting to appear. For these developments to take hold, I consider it appropriate to resolutely continue with powerful monetary easing under QQE with Yield Curve Control and sustain the situation where the output gap is in positive territory for as long as possible, as this should lead to achieving the price stability target of 2 percent at the earliest possible time.  B. Challenges to Address in Continuing to Pursue Monetary Easing There are two important challenges to address in resolutely continuing with the current powerful monetary easing. The first is to maintain public confidence in the Bank's monetary policy, even under prolonged monetary easing, by further clarifying its future policy stance that aims at achieving the price stability target of 2 percent. At the latest Monetary Policy Meeting (MPM) held on July 30 and 31, 2018, the Bank decided to introduce forward guidance for policy rates. Specifically, it has strongly committed itself to the intention of "maintaining the current extremely low levels of short- and long-term interest rates for an extended period of time, taking into account uncertainties regarding economic activity and prices including the effects of the consumption tax hike scheduled to take place in October 2019." I believe this will help strengthen the Bank's commitment to achieving the price stability target.  Second, in a situation where inflation is taking time to rise and the current monetary easing thus needs to be continued, the possible impact of monetary policy on the Japanese government bond (JGB) market and financial institutions must be monitored even more 
10 closely. Even the most effective of medicines comes with side effects, and in this sense, a candid assessment of how and in what areas monetary policy is exerting its effects becomes crucial.  (1) Impact of Monetary Policy on JGB and Other Markets First, Japan's JGB market has indeed regained some stability in response to the Bank's monetary policy decision released on July 31. Nevertheless, some developments have given rise to concerns that market functioning has deteriorated. Specifically, with the decline in the amount of JGB transactions, the number of days when inter-dealer transactions of newly-issued 10-year bonds were not settled has been growing at an unprecedented pace since the beginning of 2018. Moreover, while long-term interest rates are often used as a barometer for economic activity, there have been instances where Japanese long-term interest rates have merely followed the rise in overseas long-term interest rates, including those of the United States. Given these developments, some market participants have voiced concern that the functioning of financial markets may be declining -- in terms of a "fair price formation mechanism" for buyers and sellers, and of "signaling effects" as an economic barometer. Speaking from experience as someone who has worked in the market for a long time, interest rates essentially have been determined by the market. Thus, there is no change in the Bank's stance that, even under the framework of yield curve control, it is through the impact on markets that the Bank will encourage interest rates to approach the target level of yields. However, given that transactions have been carried out within a specific narrow price range over a prolonged period in line with the Bank's target level of 10-year JGB yields, the number of market participants, including a wide range of investors, arbitragers, and speculators, has become limited, and restrictions have been placed on the incentives for transactions. I believe this is one of the factors behind recent developments in the JGB market. At the latest MPM, upon maintaining the target level of 10-year JGB yields at around 0 percent, the Bank made it clear that, under the target, long-term yields "may move upward and downward to some extent mainly depending on developments in economic activity and prices." Movement among long-term yields may be assumed to be about double the range of around plus or minus 0.1 percent since the introduction of yield curve control. This range seems acceptable considering recent developments in 10-year government bond yields in major economies (Chart 10).  
11  Some may argue that the effects of monetary easing could be weakened by even the slightest rise in interest rate levels. At present, however, new loans to individuals and corporations extended by major financial institutions are mostly based on or linked to short-term interest rates, and regarding corporate bond issuance -- a medium- and long-term funding means -- the amount outstanding of domestic straight bonds, including those issued by banks and insurance companies, has been about 60 trillion yen. Therefore, even if long-term yields moved within a wider range and 10-year JGB yields rose somewhat in response to the Bank's recently implemented policy measure, the effect on financial institutions' lending and the corporate bond market is likely to be limited. In fact, this rise is expected to enhance the sustainability of the Bank's monetary easing policy (Chart 11). Let me add that the Bank will purchase JGBs promptly and appropriately in the event of a rapid increase in the yields, as it does not intend the level of yields to rise as a result of its recently implemented measure.   Moreover, the Bank has been purchasing exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) so that their amounts outstanding will increase at annual paces of about 6 trillion yen and about 90 billion yen, respectively. The Bank has worked to enhance the flexibility and sustainability of the current monetary policy framework, stating that it "may increase or decrease the amount of purchases depending on market conditions" with a view to lowering risk premia of asset prices in an appropriate manner (Chart 11).  (2) Impact of Monetary Policy on Financial Institutions It is important to monitor closely the possible effects of continued low interest rates not only on the JGB and other markets, but also on financial institutions. The net income of some financial institutions has been supported by the realization of gains from the sales of bonds and assets such as stock investment trusts, as well as the reversal of allowance for doubtful accounts. However, financial results for fiscal 2017 indicate that, for all types of financial institutions, net interest income has decreased as domestic lending margins have narrowed, and unrealized gains/losses on holdings of bonds and other debt securities have deteriorated in response to a rise in U.S. long-term interest rates.  
12 Following the lead of major banks, financial institutions have proceeded with efforts to improve their business efficiency through the introduction of various labor-saving technologies, including AI, suggesting that there is still room to increase profitability by cutting costs. Nevertheless, the benefits of these efforts may take time to materialize. It goes without saying that monetary policy is not conducted solely for the sake of financial institutions, but it also must be acknowledged that financial institutions play a key role in passing on the effects of monetary policy to the economy. Therefore, careful attention should continue to be paid to changes in the business conditions of financial institutions, including regional institutions, and how this affects the financial system and the financial intermediation function.   C. Future Conduct of Monetary Policy Let me now discuss some salient points regarding the future conduct of monetary policy based on the objectives and effects of such policy and the impact on the JGB market and financial institutions that I have outlined so far. Prudence is required when conducting monetary policy; decisions must be made after weighing the medium- to long-term positive effects against the unintended side effects. When policy side effects accumulate over an extended period, the risk is that it may prove difficult or even too late to deal with these unintended consequences once they materialize. That is to say, we must focus not only on the time frame in which monetary policy produces its positive effects, but also on the time frame in which the side effects build up. Conducting monetary policy calls for a multi-faceted approach that takes both these aspects into consideration. At least for now, I believe that financial institutions in Japan as a whole have strong resilience against stress in terms of both capital and liquidity, and stability in the financial system has been maintained. However, in facilitating the formation of an appropriate yield curve, the Bank should take particular account of developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions, as was indicated when QQE with Yield Curve Control was introduced in September 2016.  As the Bank resolutely continues with the current monetary easing policy, it will conduct monetary policy in an appropriate manner so that the momentum toward achieving the price stability target will be maintained, while examining all relevant risks.

Luis de Guindos: The euro area - current status and challengesaheadSpeech by Mr Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, at La Grandacourses, Asturias, 31 August 2018.*   *   *It is a pleasure to be here at La Granda courses in Asturias. In my remarks today, I would like toreview the economic developments in the euro area, explain our recent monetary policydecisions and reflect on the necessary reforms of Economic and Monetary Union, or EMU.Recent economic developmentsEconomic growth in the euro area remains solid and broad-based, as confirmed by the latestdata. Preliminary figures show that real GDP grew by 0.4% quarter-on-quarter during the secondquarter of 2018.In the first half of 2018, growth weakened from its very high rates of last year, partly reflectinglower exports, compounded by temporary supply-side constraints at national and global level.Although growth has slowed earlier than anticipated, we expect the expansion to continue. In fact,the current expansion is shorter in length and smaller in size than historical averages. It haslasted just five years and real GDP is now 10% above the trough in the first quarter of 2013. Inthe past, growth phases lasted, on average, seven and a half years from trough to peak, withGDP increasing 21% over the same period.While risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remain broadly balanced, uncertaintiesemerging from increased global protectionism, the finalisation of the Brexit negotiations andvulnerabilities in emerging markets have become more visible than a few months ago.The ongoing expansion has led to strong employment gains. Since the beginning of the recovery,around 8.4 million jobs have been created. Euro area unemployment declined to 8.2% in July, thelowest level in almost ten years. This is particularly relevant in Spain, where unemploymentdeclined by almost 11 percentage points from the peak of the crisis, to 15.4% currently. Almosttwo million jobs (1.9) have been created since the start of the recovery.Thanks to the recovery in labour markets, consumer spending is still robust. The steady rise incompensation per employee has increased household disposable income. Moreover,consumption benefits from an easier transition from unemployment to employment andincreased job security. Lower unemployment not only pushes up the disposable income of thosewho find a job, but also reduces the perceived risk of job loss, giving workers less incentive tohold precautionary savings.The investment outlook remains solid on the back of improving profitability and favourablefinancing conditions. According to the July bank lending survey, credit standards for loans toenterprises and households have loosened further. Moreover, net demand for all types of loanshas increased and is expected to grow in the next quarter too, supporting loan growth. In Spain,credit standards for new loans eased across all segments. While net demand for loans toenterprises remained unchanged, it increased for loans to households.We are therefore confident that the underlying strength of the euro area economy will continue tosupport the sustained convergence of inflation to our aim in the medium term.According to the flash estimates, HICP inflation edged down to 2.0% in August from 2.1% in July,mainly reflecting higher energy prices. On the basis of the latest oil futures prices, headline1 1 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
inflation is expected to hover around the current level for the rest of the year.Although measures of underlying inflation remain generally muted, they have risen from previouslows. Looking ahead, underlying inflation is expected to pick up towards the end of the summer,supported by our monetary policy measures and strengthening domestic price pressures, whichare sufficiently robust to counter the downward pressure from the euro’s appreciation in 2017.Domestic price pressures have gradually risen on the back of the ongoing economic expansion,the resulting absorption of economic slack and rising wage growth. In particular, the tightening inlabour markets supports the pick-up in nominal wage growth both across countries and sectors.Non-wage domestic cost pressures and the stronger pricing power of domestic firms are furthercontributing to higher prices. Moreover, domestic producer price inflation for non-food consumergoods increased further in June, with the year-on-year growth rate at its highest level since late2012. Services producer price inflation has been on an upward trajectory since the secondquarter of 2016.Against this backdrop, the ECB’s Governing Council carried out a thorough assessment of priceand wage pressures and the inflation outlook at its meeting in June of this year.Monetary policy stanceThe Governing Council carefully reviewed the progress achieved towards a sustainedadjustment in the path of inflation, guided by three criteria: convergence, confidence andresilience.For convergence, headline inflation should be on track to reach levels consistent with theGoverning Council’s inflation aim of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. In line withthis criterion, the June Eurosystem staff projections see headline inflation reaching 1.7% in eachof the next three years. These are the latest in a series of projections that have pointed to aconvergence of headline inflation towards the Governing Council’s inflation aim.Regarding confidence, uncertainty around the projected path of inflation has diminished.Moreover, underlying inflation has increased from the very low levels observed in 2016 and isexpected to rise amid an expanding economy, high levels of capacity utilisation and labourmarket tightening. Stronger underlying inflation pressures, in turn, should pass through toheadline inflation.In terms of resilience, the projected path of inflation is expected to be maintained even after agradual ending of net asset purchases.On the basis of this assessment, the Governing Council concluded that substantial progress hasbeen made towards a sustained adjustment. Given the underlying strength of the euro areaeconomy, together with well-anchored longer-term inflation expectations, we are confident thatthe sustained convergence of inflation towards our aim will continue in the period ahead, evenafter a gradual winding-down of our net asset purchases.As a result, we took a number of decisions in June.First – subject to incoming data confirming our medium-term inflation outlook – we anticipatereducing the monthly net asset purchases from €30 billion to €15 billion at the end of September2018 and ending net asset purchases at the end of December 2018.Second, we intend to continue reinvesting the principal payments from maturing securitiespurchased under the asset purchase programme for an extended period of time after the end ofnet purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidityconditions and an ample degree of monetary policy accommodation. 2 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
Third, we expect the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels at least through thesummer of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure that the evolution ofinflation remains aligned with our current expectations of a sustained adjustment path.Together, these measures will continue to provide the necessary degree of monetary policyaccommodation to bring inflation back towards a level that is below, but close to, 2%. Lookingahead, monetary policy will continue to be firmly guided by the outlook for price stability and ourstance will evolve in a data-dependent and time-consistent manner.Having reflected on the current economic situation in the euro area and the correspondingmonetary policy stance, let me now turn to the future, notably to governance of EMU.EMU governanceThe ECB’s monetary policy measures introduced since 2014 have been essential in supportingthe robust recovery and paving the way for inflation to return towards our objective. Similarly, theremoval of some of the institutional and structural factors that contributed to the crisis helpedmaintain that recovery. Nonetheless, the architecture of EMU is still incomplete in many ways.Further reforms are needed to make the financial sector more stable. As the euro area’s financialsystem is predominantly bank-based, completing the banking union remains a key priority. Wegladly welcome the agreement on the European Stability Mechanism, or ESM, as the backstopfor the Single Resolution Fund. If implemented swiftly, it will create confidence in theeffectiveness of resolution and make the sector as a whole more stable.Most importantly, we need to make headway in establishing the third pillar of the banking union,the European Deposit Insurance Scheme, or EDIS. Ongoing discussions have been held up onthe premise that risk reduction must come before risk-sharing.However, substantial risk reduction has already taken place. The significant banks’ CommonEquity Tier 1 ratios – a key indicator of bank health – are now 67% higher than they were tenyears ago. And further reduction of non-performing loans and toxic assets in the portfolios ofsome large banks is under way.Moreover, risk-sharing can help reduce risks. In its envisaged steady state as a fully mutualisedfund, EDIS would reduce the risk of bank runs and allow full fungibility of deposits across theeuro area, thereby mitigating the risk of financial fragmentation. EDIS would hence help containmarket panic when crises hit and reduce the fallout for taxpayers, as costs can be borne by thebanks themselves. Risk-sharing and risk reduction are thus mutually reinforcing.At the same time, we need to make progress in developing a genuine capital markets union.Deep and well-integrated cross-border funding would improve the private sector’s capacity toabsorb local shocks, reducing the burden on fiscal policies. A capital markets union wouldprovide various additional benefits. For example, harmonised insolvency frameworks wouldmake it easier for banks to deal with non-performing assets, thereby facilitating orderly riskreduction.Beyond these necessary reforms in the financial sector, more economic convergence is neededto make EMU resilient.At the national level, structural reforms remain a priority in order to increase the growth potentialand resilience of local economies. While a full, transparent and consistent implementation of theStability and Growth Pact is essential, country-specific recommendations, or CSRs – issuedunder the European Semester – should be given similar importance.CSRs provide guidance to Member States on how to address reforms and macroeconomic2 3 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
imbalances. They have a broad focus on fiscal-structural policies, framework conditions, andlabour and product markets. In light of persistent imbalances, the track record in CSRimplementation remains poor. Over the past five years, most CSRs were, at best, only partlyaddressed by Member States. This is unsatisfactory, especially as the economic recoveryprovides a favourable environment for reform.At the same time, Member States should agree on broad-based and balanced institutionalreforms to facilitate better collective outcomes. These dimensions – action at the national andsupranational level – should be seen as complementary.Improving the crisis management framework at the supranational level would make EMU moreresilient. In this regard, the ECB welcomes the commitment to strengthen the ESM made at therecent Euro Summit.Moreover, the euro area would benefit from a common stabilisation function. Such an instrumentcould provide macroeconomic support in the event of euro area-wide recessions, therebymaintaining convergence and reducing the burden on monetary policy. However, such a fiscalinstrument should not undermine incentives for Member States to pursue sound policies at thenational level.ConclusionGrowth in the euro area economy is solid and broad-based. The underlying strength of theeconomy continues to support the sustained adjustment of inflation towards our objective.Following strong growth rates in 2017, the recovery in the euro area has slowed down in 2018,however. The duration of the current expansion, which began in 2013, is still below the historicalaverage. Its amplitude, the percentage gain in GDP relative to the trough, is also low by historicalstandards.At the same time, downside risks to growth, notably related to the threat of protectionism and therise in trade tensions, remain prominent. The outlook for US monetary policy moves andvulnerabilities in emerging markets add to the overall uncertainty, as does the limited progress onthe Brexit discussion.Solidifying the institutional architecture of EMU is essential in order to foster cohesive economicperformance without fragmentation or excessive imbalances. Monetary policy has played the keyrole since the financial crisis but cannot remain the only game in town. We now need action inother policy areas – notably fiscal policy and structural reforms. There is a need for responsiblefiscal policy, given the levels of public debt. Some countries should take advantage of theongoing recovery and favourable financial conditions to reduce debt burdens, whereas countrieswith fiscal space should increase their public investment. Likewise, significant steps should betaken on the structural policy side, with a view to increasing potential growth in the medium term.Measures to improve the functioning of labour and product markets and to strengthenprocedures for the correction of macroeconomic imbalances take prominence here.A robust economy relies on sound economic governance. Reforms at the national and EU levelare needed to uphold a stable financial system and a resilient monetary union. A commonstabilisation function, which − in the spirit of a true counter-cyclical fiscal policy instrument –would maintain convergence in the event of large shocks, is an overriding priority. Completing thebanking union with the establishment of EDIS, its third pillar, and firm moves towards capitalmarkets union, promoting deep and liquid bond and equity markets, are necessary reforms of thefinancial sector. Attaining these goals is highly relevant for financial stability, further integration,private risk-sharing and economic growth.Thank you for your attention. 4 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches

                    Haruhiko Kuroda Governor of the Bank of Japan  Post-crisis Futures Markets Keynote speech at the symposium commemorating        the 30th anniversary of stock index futures  Bank of Japan September 3, 2018   (English translation based on the Japanese original) 
1  Introduction It is a great honor to be invited to speak at this symposium commemorating the 30th anniversary of stock index futures in Japan.  A decade has passed since the collapse of Lehman Brothers, which triggered the global financial crisis. During the last 10 years since that time, global financial markets have faced and have been affected by various negative political and economic shocks such as the European debt problem in the first half of the 2010s. Japanese stock and futures markets have not been immune and the turnover of cash stocks and the trading volume of stock futures were sluggish for some time after the global financial crisis (Chart 1). Thereafter, however, against the background of the recovery of the global economy and solid corporate performance, global financial markets have rebounded to pre-crisis levels.  This year also marks the 5th anniversary of the business integration of the Tokyo Stock Exchange Group and the Osaka Securities Exchange. Even following the global financial crisis, various initiatives aimed at enhancing user-friendliness have been taken to meet the diverse needs of investors and firms including the introduction of new products, extension of trading hours, and IT system reform. Those initiatives have been vital for maintaining and enhancing the functions of the Japanese exchanges since the crisis, and I would like to pay tribute to all of those who have worked so hard to carry out those initiatives.  Moving on, as it has been 30 years since stock index futures first appeared in Japan, let us take this opportunity to return to the basics and re-clarify the function of futures contracts; futures contracts, in principle, are used to "transfer risks," namely to hedge risks or speculate on price changes by trading assets on a future date at a predetermined price. In this regard, derivatives contracts such as forwards also have the same function. However, the two contracts differ in that forwards are derivatives contracts based on bilateral agreements between two parties, while futures are derivatives contracts that are traded on "exchanges," including clearing houses.  Futures contracts traded on exchanges are standardized and offer the benefits of low transaction costs, fair and transparent price formation, risk management measures such as 
2  margin requirements and the marking to market of assets, and safe central clearing; thanks to these features, futures contracts are expected to attract more market participants and thereby realize enhanced market liquidity. Such enhanced market liquidity is in turn expected to strengthen the basic function of futures contracts, which, as I just mentioned, is to "transfer risks."  Skepticism about the function of futures contracts sometimes emerges, especially when markets experience significant asset price fluctuations in the wake of a financial crisis. The typical assertion is that the existence of futures contracts amplifies spot price changes in the underlying assets. However, as long as futures markets offer enhanced market liquidity supported by the functions of exchanges, it is expected that the price discovery function inherent in futures would remain somewhat resilient even during a crisis, and this will thereby help the spot market to swiftly return to a price formation process that properly reflects the supply and demand conditions of the underlying assets and market participants' views.  Given the role of exchanges and their relation to market liquidity, it is impressive that the world's first organized futures contracts -- which are similar to those currently traded on exchanges -- were already established in the 18th century at the Dojima Rice Exchange in Osaka. The fact that futures contracts in their long history have supported the development of the market economy and have overcome numerous crises by undergoing appropriate changes shows just how valuable they are.  Also, it should be noted that various ongoing changes in the market environment since the global financial crisis have necessitated futures markets such as stock futures and commodity futures to undergo new transformations. Let me elaborate on new trends in futures markets and the challenges brought about by those trends.  Post-crisis Trends in Futures Markets  Tightening of Financial Regulations First, I would like to talk about the effects of the tightening of financial regulations. The 
3  global financial crisis following the collapse of Lehman Brothers adversely affected market liquidity in various financial transactions. The decline in market liquidity was particularly evident in bilateral over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. Before the financial crisis, OTC derivatives were very popular among customers seeking higher profits because the bilateral flexibility of OTC derivatives enabled various customized structures to achieve higher yields. However, once the financial crisis occurred, there was suddenly a great deal of concern about the counterparty credit risks of financial institutions, particularly in the United States and Europe, and the flexible but complex structures of OTC derivatives made it difficult to pinpoint and specify the size of those risks. As a result, market liquidity of OTC derivatives declined significantly in a short period and there was a run on OTC derivatives markets, including a rapid reversal of investment positions.  On the other hand, futures contracts traded on exchanges were processed in a generally stable manner even amid the financial crisis, as the risk management of exchanges and clearing through central counterparties (CCPs) proved somewhat effective.  Thus, the functions of exchanges fostered over many years contributed to avoiding disruption of futures markets during the global financial crisis. It was therefore decided to incorporate the essence of those functions in the plan for OTC market reform. Specifically, in order to improve the transparency and robustness of contracts, standardized OTC derivatives contracts were obliged to be traded on exchanges or electronic trading platforms, and cleared through CCPs.1 Furthermore, the exchange of margins based on associated risks became mandatory for non-centrally cleared tailor-made OTC derivatives contracts. In view of those regulatory trends, there has been an increase overseas in the "futurization of OTC derivatives," which refers to the clearing of transactions through CCPs by listing futures contracts on exchanges in advance, mirroring the contractual conditions of OTC derivatives deals made with a certain frequency.                                                    1 In autumn 2009, the following agreements were reached at the Group of Twenty (G-20) Pittsburgh Summit: (1) all standardized OTC derivatives contracts should be traded on exchanges or electronic trading platforms and (2) cleared through CCPs; (3) OTC derivatives contracts should be reported to trade repositories; and (4) non-centrally cleared contracts should be subject to higher capital requirements. 
4  Accordingly, many OTC derivatives contracts have shifted to exchange trades and clearing through CCPs (Chart 2). However, this could give rise to several issues. For example, there are concerns that this change might increase moral hazard among market participants given that they do not directly bear counterparty credit risks and have less incentive to monitor credit risks. What is more, and perhaps the most crucial point, is that exchanges and clearing houses would face concentrated risks as they accommodate more OTC derivatives contracts reflecting the needs of market participants to mitigate counterparty credit risks. Accordingly, exchanges and clearing houses must appropriately manage and mitigate those concentrated risks so that futures and derivatives contracts traded on exchanges would be processed in a stable manner if there is another global financial crisis. To this end, it is also important for exchanges and clearing houses to ensure that they have appropriate levels of loss-absorbing capacity through assessments based on stress testing.2  Technological Innovation Second, I would like to mention the effects of innovation in the field of financial technology. The remarkable development in information technology in recent years has dramatically accelerated order processing. For example, in the stock market of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the new "Arrowhead" trading system, which launched in January 2010, has enabled orders to be processed in milliseconds -- a speed which could never be matched by human ability. Against the background of this technological innovation, there has been a growing presence in financial markets of so-called high-frequency trading (HFT) players, who use automated algorithms to repeatedly execute small orders at extremely high speed and frequency. The prevalence of HFT might differ somewhat geographically, but for example, there is a view that the share of HFT in stock markets has reached around 50 percent in the United States and around 40 percent in Europe. That share has also increased in Japan, and the number of contracts executed from the co-location areas of the stock                                                    2 For details on global discussions regarding concentrated risks in financial market infrastructures due to the tightening of financial regulations, see "Seisankikan wo meguru global na taiou ni tsuite (Global Approach to Central Counterparties)," Payment and Settlement Systems Report Annex Series, August 2017 (available in Japanese only). 
5  market of the Tokyo Stock Exchange has reached around 40 percent (Chart 3).3 Equally, there is a view that the share of HFT in Japanese stock futures has reached a somewhat high level due to the introduction of IT systems designed for high-speed order processing.  Positive assessments of HFT can be summarized as follows. First, there is a view that HFT has improved market liquidity as HFT players engage in "passive market making" against other investors by simultaneously placing a vast amount of "buy" and "sell" orders in order to exploit arbitrage opportunities on bid-ask spreads. Second, HFT in theory is expected to constrain stock price fluctuations and thereby reduce volatility as sell orders are placed when prices rise even slightly and buy orders are placed when prices decline. In fact, some empirical analyses have verified such an improvement in market liquidity and a decline in volatility.4  At the same time, some argue that HFT could reduce market liquidity and contribute to volatility in the event of a sudden shock that has a greater impact than forecasted by its algorithms.5 Some also voice concern over the risk that a large volume of irrational orders could be placed as a result of human error unintentionally embedded in an algorithm.6                                                     3 It is believed that HFT players, who require faster access for transactions in milliseconds, usually place orders from co-location areas (special areas in the same building that hosts the primary systems of the exchanges where market participants can install their own servers containing trading algorithms). 4 See, for example, "Kabushiki shijyou ni okeru kousoku kouhindo torihiki he no eikyou (Effects of High Speed and Frequency Trading on the Stock Market)," Bank of Japan Review, No. 13-J-2, January 2013 (available in Japanese only), which provides a theoretical summary of HFT and analysis of the effects on the Japanese stock market. 5 In spite of the popular view at one time that attributed the "flash crash" in the U.S. stock market in May 2010 to HFT, a joint report by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) concluded that the crash was not directly caused by HFT, but rather by a complex combination of factors. However, the report also pointed out that HFT players accelerated price fluctuations by rapidly withdrawing liquidity during the propagation of market turmoil. 6 In August 2012, many stocks on the New York Stock Exchange experienced a "mini flash crash" due to a massive number of erroneous orders. The erroneous orders have been attributed to system issues caused by human error. 
6  As I mentioned, assessments of HFT have not been entirely positive. It is therefore important to consider measures and initiatives to ensure that the growing presence of HFT players contribute to enhancing market efficiency and liquidity through appropriate arbitrage and market-making activities and does not result only in transaction speed competition. For example, if the risks of high speed and frequency trading amplifying price changes due to one-sided algorithmic trades or a malfunction in programs and servers are left unattended, they might impair financial market stability, and in turn weaken the risk transfer and price discovery functions of futures markets. Tackling those issues is by no means an easy task, but it is critical to properly consider measures to prevent them.  The specific measures to deal with those issues are not to be implemented by exchanges alone because they also rest on regulations on HFT and other factors. That said, with the advent of HFT and the growing presence of HFT players in financial markets, various self-imposed requirements for exchange trades associated with financial technological innovation and the role of exchanges in risk management and monitoring are becoming increasingly important.  Increased Use of Futures for Asset Management Third, I would like to briefly touch on the effects of the widespread movement to use futures for asset management. Participants in futures markets are broadly divided into three classical categories: (1) hedgers, who hedge against price risks in underlying assets; (2) speculators, who take on such price risks; and (3) arbitrageurs, who seek arbitrage between spot and futures markets. However, during the last 10 years since the global financial crisis, futures markets have witnessed the growing presence of new investment players that take long positions in the medium to long term, such as investment trusts and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).  The increased use of futures for asset management, in addition to hedging and speculation, can be viewed favorably because it provides households with more options for portfolio selection. Furthermore, the growing presence of new buyers with medium- to long-term investment horizons could increase the market depth of futures markets. It can be expected that this would enhance market liquidity, and thereby improve the risk transfer and price 
7  discovery functions of futures markets.   However, if the diversity of market participants is impaired due to the growing presence of a particular investor type, prices might cease to appropriately reflect the fundamentals behind the transactions because they might be excessively affected by trading strategies employed by those investors.  In fact, the growing share of investment trusts and ETFs in futures markets has affected the correlation between different asset types. A typical example is the effects observed in price formation of overseas commodity futures such as crude oil. Since the global financial crisis, a large amount of investment funds has flowed to commodity futures markets in pursuit of higher yield against the background of global monetary relaxation. In this process, commodities became embedded in the global portfolios of large investors extending across multiple regions and assets. In general, in the event of an exogenous shock, global portfolio rebalancing moves multiple risky asset prices in the same direction. In this regard, for example, returns on commodity index futures showed little sign of correlation with those on global stock indices at least until the middle of the 2000s. However, as a wide range of investors have started to incorporate commodities in their asset portfolios since the financial crisis, the correlation between returns on commodity index futures and those on stock indices has structurally increased (Chart 4). In the long run, the impact on futures prices stemming from price fluctuations in other asset classes, in addition to the correlation between futures prices and the prices of underlying assets, could affect the risk transfer and price discovery functions of futures markets. In this sense as well, it is important to not only increase the number of market players but also gather a diverse set of investors with various investing styles and investment horizons. I hope an increasingly wider range of investors and greater investor diversity would continue to be observed.  Concluding Remarks I have so far elaborated on new trends in futures markets brought about by significant environmental changes since the global financial crisis and the challenges brought by those trends, focusing on three perspectives: (1) tightening of financial regulations; (2) technological innovation; and (3) increased use of futures for asset management. None of 
8  the challenges I mentioned today would be easy to tackle, but I believe that the functions of futures markets, which have offered benefits to financial markets for many years, would develop and be maintained if market participants take on these challenges and adapt to the new environment, just as they have done over the last 30 years. The Bank of Japan obtains information from futures markets that is valuable in understanding the markets' views and sentiment toward the economy and corporate performance. The Bank, as the central bank of Japan, would provide support through research studies and participation in discussions at home and abroad so that Japanese futures markets would develop in a more efficient and stable manner.  Thank you for your attention. 
Ahmed Naseer: The need to regulate virtual currencyKeynote speech by Mr Ahmed Naseer, Governor of the Maldives Monetary Authority, at the 5thMaldives Islamic Banking &amp; Finance Industry Conference, Malé, 27 November 2018.*   *   *Chairperson, Distinguished Speakers, Distinguished guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, AssalamAlaikum. Good Morning.I am deeply honored to speak at this important and significant Conference, one which is veryrelevant and important in the development of the financial sector of the Maldives. As the regulatorof banks, and financial institutions in the country, Maldives Monetary Authority is grateful to theorganizers of this Conference, and congratulate you all for completing five years of this series.MMA is proud to be a partner in promoting and developing Islamic finance in the Maldives, andassure you that we will continue this journey together with all our stake holders.Ladies and Gentlemen.Bitcoin, the world’s first cryptocurrency (or virtual currency), long obscured with a reputation as afringe economic phenomenon, has gone mainstream. The skyrocketing price in late 2017 hasmade Bitcoin a household name. Proposed in a 2008 white paper by software developer SatoshiNakomoto, Bitcoin was an attempt to enable peer-to-peer “electronic cash” as an alternative toconventional banking in the wake of the global financial crisis. When released in 2009, the virtualcurrency had a value of less than one U.S. penny per “coin.” However, just nine years later, onebitcoin reached $ 17,900 in the middle of December 2017, and the cryptocurrency’s marketcapitalization is now over $200 billion.One might think this as a normal product circle, but the reality is, cryptocurrency has been afavorable payment instrument over the decade. And the usage of cryptocurrencies will be ascommon as the use of normal bank notes and payment instruments. Just recently, Canada’sfirst Bitcoin-backed loan has been issued during the first week of November this year.It is not a false assumption that some of the Maldivians even own cryptocurrencies such asBitcoin. We have already seen some business entities even trying to introduce cryptocurrencywallets into Maldives. It is just a matter of time before someone starts mining cryptocurrency inthe Maldives. Therefore, it would be unwise not to consider the emergence of cryptocurrency inMaldives as an acceptable payment instrument. Likewise, as policy makers, we should notignore financial technology and regulatory technology in our future economic and monetary policyimplementation. More importantly, we should not discourage technology and innovation in ourfinancial sectors.Ladies and Gentlemen.What are cryptocurrencies? I have been asked several times over the past one year. Well, it is atechnological development that utilize a technique better known as cryptography. And what iscryptography? The technique of protecting information by transforming it (encrypting) intounreadable format, that can only be deciphered (decrypted) by someone who possess a secretkey. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoins are secured via this technique using an ingenioussystem of public and private keys.Ladies and Gentlemen.Let me take a step back and talk a little bit about the Cyberspace, the vast new domain ofinteraction, where we are all connected in the modern world. A place where we are all unified,and totally free. A place where we now spend increasing hours of our day. Where we do more of 1 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
our shopping. More of our dating. More of our learning. Commerce, Broadcasting, and newsmaking. Selling of goods and services, and ideas.A place where we are all unified, and totally free. Free from filters. Free from values. And freefrom true governance.Sometimes some of us act as though, no one is watching in the cyberspace, with tweetstrashing people, hate speech, gambling, pornography, and other cybercrimes, it has becomeimportant for us to pause a little bit for some moral reflection.As Tom Friedman puts it in his recent book, we need to balance technological progress with asense of humanity, and moral values.As Former US President Obama said when he visited Hiroshima in May 2016,“Technological progress without an equivalent progress in human institutions can doom us. Thescientific revolution that led to the splitting of an atom requires a moral revolution as well”.Ladies and Gentlemen.Cryptocurrency, like any other payment instrument poses, a variety of risks to the economy, andmore importantly, to the financial sector of any country. The risk factor is heightened now,because the use of cryptocurrency, has expanded to mortgage and security lending.Due to the nature and the specific features of cryptocurrency, it has long been understood thatcryptocurrency has been a somewhat attractive form of payment instrument for moneylaundering, terrorist financing and tax evasion.Now, what are those features?Anonimity: The anonymity surrounding cryptocurrencies, prevents transactions from beingadequately monitored, allowing shady transactions to occur outside the regulatory perimeter.Cross-border nature: Transaction occur cross-border, and are nearly instant in the networkand are confirmed in a couple of minutes. Since they happen in a global network ofcomputers, they are completely indifferent of any physical location. There are no third partiesinvolved in verification or validation.No gatekeeper: The software that everybody can download is for free and there is nocentralized coin issuer or an intermediary to oversee the coin trading activities. Anyone canreceive and send cryptocurrencies as soon as a cryptocurrency software is installed withoutbeing monitored by a central government authority.Due to these factors, countries are concerned about the misuse of cryptocurrency, especially tolaunder proceeds of crime, fund terrorist activities and evade taxation. In a recent report by a datasecurity company, CipherTrace, $761 million has already been laundered via cryptocurrenciesso far this year.Therefore, international organizations such as the IMF and EU are advocating for regulatingcryptocurrency, despite challenges such as anonymity, cross-border nature of usecryptocurrency, lack of central intermediary to regulate, etc. In February 2018, Ms. ChristineLagarde, head of IMF said in an interview on CNN that due to the potential illicit use ofcryptocurrency, cryptocurrency regulations are inevitable. Her remarks echoed the initiatives ofcountries to bring cryptocurrency into a regulatory framework to combat money laundering andterrorism financing.In April 2018, the Parliament of the European Union passed changes to anti-money launderinglegislation that will impose new regulations on cryptocurrency exchanges and custodians 2 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
operating in Europe. The US has already extended its AML regulatory framework tocryptocurrency. Other countries include, Australia, Canada, Japan, Mexico and Switzerland.Therefore, it is important to recognize the role cryptocurrencies play in the financial markets, andto start thinking about allowing emerging technologies to have a level playing field in thesemarkets.To conclude, I would like to stress on the importance of allowing financial technologies into ourfinancial markets and at the same time implementing proper regulatory regimes to ensure suchtechnologies, market players and our economy is not abused for illicit purposes.Blockchain technology, if properly used, can be applied in a large variety of sectors, including,trade, commerce, healthcare and governance. It could be used in pledging of collateral,registration of shares, bonds and other assets, and operation of land registers, and many more.I wish you all a successful Conference.Thank you. Wassalam Alaikum. 3 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
Faqe 1 nga 5  Honoured, I am pleased to be here with you today to discuss and hear about a very important topic for our country's economy, and I would like to thank the American Chamber of Commerce for the invitation and to express my high considerations for businesses and their role in the country's economic development.  I believe that the topic of this conference is very good because it comes at a time when the banking sector has made great progress in improving the conditions for sustainable financing of the economy, namely businesses.  *** Kosovo's banking sector in recent years has considerably increased its role in financing the economic growth in the country, accelerating the loan growth rate, and significantly reducing loan interest rates. Easing the lending standards and reducing the loan interest rates have served as important incentives for increasing loan demand, resulting in an annual loan growth of 11.6 per cent in October this year. This indicates that access to finance, which has long been reported by businesses as one of the main barriers to their business development, is now undergoing continuous improvement. This can be noticed by the growth in lending to the sectors of the economy which in previous periods had a more limited access to banking financing. According to the latest data of October 2018, the loans granted by the banking sector to businesses are in the amount of EUR 1.7 billion which, compared with the same period of five years ago, has increased by 45 per cent. The lending structure by economic sectors has started to improve compared to the previous periods, although there is room for greater diversification of the loan portfolio in favour of the sectors that have the greatest potential to generate 
Faqe 2 nga 5  economic growth. Currently, about 50 per cent of total loans issued to enterprises are represented by loans to the trade sector. During this year, the agricultural sector and the manufacturing sector were among the sectors with the highest increase of loans received. However, the total amount of loans granted to these sectors continues to be low. The share of manufacturing sector in total loans to enterprises in October was 13 per cent, while loans to the agriculture sector accounted for about 4 per cent of total loans.  Since today's topic is related to the role of the banking sector in the country's economic development, I would like to emphasize the fact that the greatest support to these sectors of the economy, but also to the other sectors with the greatest potential to generate economic growth, is indispensable in order to have a more sustainable economic development.  However, we are also aware that the diversification of the banking sector's loan portfolio depends not only on the loan supply but is largely dependent on the loan demand. In this context, I would like to emphasize that the banks have very high financial potential for further lending growth, have eased loan standards, and have significantly reduced the cost of access to banking finance. In October 2018, the average loan interest rate was 6.6 per cent, which represents a great improvement compared to previous years. The decline in loan interest rates is clearly visible in all sectors, including loans to the agricultural sector, where the interest rate decreased to 7.5 per cent, compared to 16.7 per cent five years ago; for the industrial sector, interest rates decreased to 5.8 per cent, compared to 12.2 per cent in the past; and also for the service sector, the average interest rate decreased to 6.3 per cent, compared to 11.1 per cent five years ago. 
Faqe 3 nga 5  Improvement of the conditions for access to banking financing has also been noted with regard to other aspects, such as easing loan approval standards, reducing collateral requirements, and extending the loan maturity term. However, in order to have a greater lending to sectors that currently have the lowest access to banking financing, improving the loan supply is not enough, rather it is also necessary that the demand of these sectors for loans be higher and of better quality. I would like to say that a more comprehensive approach is needed to identify and support the development of sectors of major importance for the country's economic development. We believe that an important step to increase support to these sectors was undertaken when the Kosovo Guarantee Fund was established. So far, the total value of loans guaranteed by this Fund has reached EUR 71.3 million and has been distributed to 1,836 micro, small and medium enterprises.     *** In order to have a banking sector which serves the sustainable financing of the country's economic development, the basic prerequisite is for the sector to be sustainable. On this occasion, I would like to confirm again that Kosovo's banking sector continues to be stable based on all the indicators of financial soundness. The main focus will be on the very good quality of the loan portfolio, which reflects the good credit risk management by banks, but which can also serve as an important indicator of the favourable economic environment for the operation of banks in Kosovo. In September this year, the non-performing loans ratio was 2.8 per cent, reflecting a very good condition of loan portfolio quality. There are numerous factors that have contributed to the good quality of the loan portfolio, but amongst the most important ones I consider the macroeconomic stability, legislative 
Faqe 4 nga 5  developments over the last years, as is the case with private enforcement agents who have facilitated the execution of collateral and the implementation of contracts, prudential oversight by the CBK, adequate bank risk management by banks, and responsible behaviour of citizens of the Republic of Kosovo in meeting their contractual obligations vis-à-vis banks. The satisfactory situation regarding the stability of the banking sector is also reflected by other indicators, such as capital adequacy and liquidity indicators, which have consistently exceeded the regulatory requirements and represent the high solvency of the banking sector.     *** The Central Bank of the Republic of Kosovo, with all its capacities, is committed to supporting the sustainable development of the financial system by providing the entire necessary infrastructure to support the development of financial institutions and at the same time assuring that their activity provides financial stability. In this regard, we are providing the banking sector with the most modern standards of regulation and financial oversight, thus enabling the banks and other financial institutions in Kosovo to operate under the rules in force in all developed countries. Also, CBK provides the banking sector with a modern financial infrastructure. The interbank payment system, which is a modern, efficient and secure system, and the loan registry that provides banks with the most modern services in this area are good examples to illustrate the development of financial infrastructure in Kosovo. *** At the conclusion of my speech, I would like to emphasize once again that Kosovo's banking sector is in sound financial position and with continued growth of funding the sustainable economic development of Kosovo, nevertheless, greater 
Faqe 5 nga 5  inter-institutional commitment is required to create the necessary conditions in order for this sector's support to the country's economy and to businesses to be even greater.  *** The 100 per cent tax In principle, we support the development of free trade between all countries, but only when the principles of free trade apply reciprocally. In this respect, other countries should allow our businesses to have free access to their markets just like we allow them to freely access our market. Therefore, I consider it is time for other countries to reflect and apply the principles of free trade as a whole rather than on a selective basis because this is not acceptable to us.  
Ahmed Naseer: Financial inclusion within the MaldivesKeynote speech by Mr Ahmed Naseer, Governor of the Maldives Monetary Authority, at the 35thAsian Bankers Association General Meeting and Conference, hosted by the Bank of Maldives,Malé, 16 November 2018.*   *   *Asian Bankers Association Chairman, Mr. Daniel Wu;Managing Director and CEO of the Bank of Maldives Mr. Andrew Healy;Distinguished experts and participants;Assalaamu Alaikum, and a very good morning to you all.It gives me great pleasure to have this opportunity to speak at the 35th Asian BankersAssociation General Meeting and Conference. I am very pleased to be here today, in this uniquegathering, bringing together industry players and financial experts from every corner of the Asiaregion. In fact, the theme of this conference speaks to the heart of the imminent challenges thatcentral banks are facing today: How will the digital revolution transform the economic andfinancial landscape? How can we gain the potential socio-economic benefits of the financialtechnology or fintech, while mitigating possible risks?Ladies and gentlemen,While innovations in the financial sector are not new phenomena, the speed and broadconsequences of these innovations have drawn our attention in recent times. The rapidimprovements in computer technology such as quantum computing, innovations in cryptography,big data, artificial intelligence and the increased use of mobile phones have taken the traditionalbanking industry to a whole new level. It has enabled financial institutions to be in the financiallives of their customers at any time, any place, using any device or channel. In a nutshell,financial services are at our finger tips. In a few years from now, it is possible that the millennialsand future generations will not see the need to step inside a bank during their lifetime.Fintech has not only reshaped customer experience. It has paved the way for achieving financialinclusion, especially for a geographically dispersed country like the Maldives, to breakgeographical barriers and reach underserved populations within the islands. With the nation-widetelecommunication coverage and high mobile penetration in the country, these innovativepayment solutions have the potential to reduce cash usage and achieve financial inclusion in thecountry.At the end of last year, we reached an important milestone in advancing financial inclusion withinthe Maldives. Both telecommunications service providers now deliver easy and secure access tomobile payment services across the country. As a result, we have seen a significant increase inthe volume and value of transactions being processed through mobile wallets. This mainlystemmed from the increased extent of the e-money distribution network and the availability ofonline cash-in facilities in the country.However, the journey remains long and challenging. If we look at the current statistics, around33% of the Maldivian adult population still do not hold a bank account. Even though the level ofpenetration in the formal banking sector is relatively high in the country, providing easier accessto finance and acquiring payment services in most of the islands remain as main challenges inthe country. Looking at payment methods, cheques are still the dominant mode of making inter-bank transactions although the volume of transactions carried out through RTGS and ACH haveincreased over the past two years. Among electronic payments, card payment is the most 1 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
common payment method in the greater Male’ area and the usage of mobile payment is still notvery common across the country.For example, if we look at how pension and social benefits payments are made, these paymentsare deposited to a bank account wherein around 96% of the beneficiaries hold bank accounts atone particular bank. And this bank makes regular trips to islands to facilitate account holders towithdraw cash. This is mainly because of the gaps in the financial infrastructure andinefficiencies in the banking system. Some of them include;Unavailability of a common platform to connect banks and mobile service providersLack of an efficient payment system infrastructureLack of a comprehensive legal framework to support the payment infrastructureThe low level of automation in the banking sector; For instance, there is no proper IT setup insome of the banks and a lot of payments are still processed manuallyLadies and gentlemen,In spite of these hurdles, we do have a very ambitious plan to upgrade and modernize thenational payment system in our country. Promoting financial inclusion has, and will always be, akey priority of the MMA in its function of fostering the development of the financial sector.Therefore, one of the foremost priorities in the MMA’s strategic plan for 2018–2022 is to develop asafe and robust payment infrastructure. Because we understand that If we were to embrace thepromise of fintech and foster the benefits of these innovations, we need to invest in thesupporting infrastructure. Well! That is just one key component. We also need to strengtheninstitutional capacity by investing in human resources as it is a key ingredient in catalyzingbenefits from the much needed local fintech solutions for a country like the MaldivesSince the financial landscape of the Maldives is unique and differs from the mainstream financialmarkets in many ways, we need to be more creative in adopting and embracing thesetechnologies. It should be tailored towards local needs. We need to bring together local flavorswhen creating a more enabling environment for innovations. Therefore, it is essential to put inextra effort to build relevant expertise and necessary skills. This is because such investmentswill serve as the bedrock to provide a level playing field in terms of providing access to financeand succeeding in our journey to close the financial inclusion gap in the nation.If we look at it in a global context, many countries are also struggling to keep up with the ever-evolving financial system and to adopt fintech solutions through the formal financial channel. Onearea that I want to shed light is the risks and threats to financial integrity. There are risingconcerns regarding customer as well as investor protection, and even the adequacy of thefinancial safety net. Well! We can always amend or supplement the existing regulatoryframework to address many fintech driven risks. But how far can we go? Some of theunprecedented issues arisising from new financial products and activities may not even lie in thecurrent regulatory perimeter. Therefore, in order to adopt these new technologies such ascryptocurrencies and blockchain in the formal banking system, we require a major overhaul inthe regulatory framework to contain risks and to maintain trust and confidence in the system.Distinguished guests,Certainly, fintech has opened up new paths to help bridge existing gaps, and to shine a guidinglight towards a more financially inclusive future. However, every journey comes with its own setof risks and uncertainties. Treacherous terrains may lie ahead, and as such, we must remindourselves of the mistakes we have made in the past, which resulted in events such as the Asianfinancial crisis, the dot-com bubble and the most recent global financial crisis. In fact, much ofthe on-going narrative about the emergence of crytopcurrencies and blockchain alludes to agrowing lack of trust and confidence in the existing financial system. In light of these, I would like 2 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
to stress on the importance of maintaining financial integrity and fostering a culture of trust andconfidence in the system. The financial sector, as a whole, requires of itself to be more vigilant tothe potential risks arising from new technologies and innovations.Let me conclude by offering my humble gratitude to the Bank of Maldives for hosting thisexcellent conference and inviting me for the conference. I would also like to take this opportunityto welcome the Asian Bankers Association and to thank them for choosing the Maldives to hostthe general meeting and conference. I’m sure that we are in for a highly informative day, full offruitful discussions and presentations. I wish the best to all the speakers! Welcome and thankyou once again. 3 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
SPEECH  SVERIGES RIKSBANK SE-103 37 Stockholm (Brunkebergstorg 11)  Tel +46 8 787 00 00 Fax +46 8 21 05 31 registratorn@riksbank.se www.riksbank.se  DATE: 04/12/2018  SPEAKER: Deputy Governor Per Jansson  VENUE: Insurance Sweden, Stockholm         1 [24]  Monetary policy in less favourable times – what are the options?∗ To say the past decade has been transformative for monetary policy is scarcely an exaggeration. Many central banks have cut their policy rates to exceptionally low levels and found other ways of conducting monetary policy than adjusting interest rates. In some countries, including Sweden, the policy rate has also passed the zero bound that was considered to be the absolute minimum level not very long ago, and has entered negative territory. Despite this policy, the recovery has on the whole been slow and, above all, inflation has been low for a long time. This has led to the policy rate in many countries remaining at record low levels for sev-eral years. The need to keep policy rates so low is not only due to the financial crisis 2007–2008 and the ensuing euro crisis requiring very expansionary monetary policy. An equally important explanation is that real interest rate levels around the world have trended down for several decades, largely independent of the financial crisis. Real interest rates are currently at record low levels (see Figure 1).   The downturn in the real interest rate is a sign of the global, so-called “neutral”, rate of interest having fallen. The neutral interest rate normally refers to the real rate of interest that has neither an expansionary nor a contractionary effect on the economy.1 Central banks cannot influence the neutral interest rate but they must consider it when they adjust their policy rates. It is the relationship to the neutral interest rate that determines how expansionary or contractionary a partic-ular monetary policy is. By causing the short-term real interest rate to temporarily deviate from the neutral interest rate, the central bank can affect resource utilisa-tion and inflation via different channels.                                                            ∗ I would like to thank Mikael Apel for his assistance with the text for this speech, Emelie Theobald for help with the diagrams, Elizabeth Nilsson for translation to English and Kerstin af Jochnick, Björn Andersson, Meredith Beechey Österholm, Charlotta Edler, Rebecka Hallerby, Stefan Laséen, Åsa Olli Segendorf, Marianne Sterner and Ulf Söderström for helpful comments. 1 For a more detailed description, see for instance Kaplan (2018). 
       2 [24]  One important problem with the neutral interest rate currently being so low is that monetary policy has less scope to stimulate the economy when necessary, as it is difficult to cut the policy rate as much as would be required. Moreover, esti-mates of the neutral interest rate and its driving forces usually indicate that it will remain low for a fairly long time to come.2 This raises difficult questions both in the shorter and slightly longer perspective.  In the slightly longer perspective, the question has arisen internationally, mainly in research circles but also to some extent among central banks, whether the cur-rent inflation-targeting policy could be reformed or replaced with another mone-tary policy framework that makes it easier to counteract economic downturns and recessions in the future.3 The aim is to find a framework that reduces the risk of not being able to make monetary policy as expansionary as may sometimes be necessary. But reforming the monetary policy framework is not something that can or should be done hastily. The experiences of inflation targeting in recent decades are very favourable and it is never a good idea to “throw the baby out with the bath-water”. There is therefore reason to also consider a shorter perspective, where one assumes that the monetary policy framework will not change for some time yet. Within the scope of the current framework, and given the monetary policy situation that arose after the crisis, there is every reason to begin examining what opportunities exist to deal with the next economic downturn – whenever this may occur. So I intend to talk about these two subjects today – the conditions for dealing with the next economic downturn if we do not reform the monetary policy frame-work and the possible changes to the framework being discussed internationally and how promising I assess these to be. Let me begin with the first subject. The conditions for dealing with the next eco-nomic downturn The picture painted by Swedish analysts at present is that a regular economic downturn is not imminent (see Figure 2). But there is nevertheless much that sug-gest that it is wise to prepare for less favourable times arriving sooner than we ex-pect; the recent somewhat shaky signals regarding economic activity in Europe, the uncertainty regarding the effects of trade conflicts and Brexit, tension in the euro area and the large indebtedness and other imbalances in emerging market economies. But despite these words of warning, the most reasonable starting point is of course that developments in the coming years will be largely as the leading forecasters believe.                                                             2 See, for instance, Rachel and Smith (2017). 3 One example from the central bank world is that Wilkins (2018) indicates that this will be an issue the next time the Bank of Canada’s monetary policy framework is evaluated, in 2021.  
       3 [24]  The repo rate will be somewhat higher Given this, we can expect the repo rate to have been raised at least somewhat be-fore the less favourable times arrive. Most Swedish forecasters, including the Riks-bank, are expecting the repo rate to be 0.5–0.75 per cent at the end of 2020. Until then, almost all analysts believe that growth will slow down, but not to the extent that the Swedish economy will enter a regular economic downturn before 2021. There are of course no guarantees, but this is how things look at the moment. Neither is it possible for anyone to say how soon after 2021 a downturn may oc-cur. It could come soon after, or some years later.4  Now 0.5–0.75 per cent is not a particularly high level for the repo rate, if one looks at it from an historical point of view. But on the other hand, history may not be as informative in this case as there has been a downward trend in global real interest rates in recent decades, as I just pointed out. It is therefore difficult to know what is currently a neutral, “normal” level for the repo rate. What one can say with some certainty is that it is much lower than it was 10–15 years ago. But even taking this into account, a repo rate of 0.5–0.75 per cent does not appear particularly high if an economic downturn were to occur in early 2021. How much is the interest rate usually cut in economic downturns? In Sweden, it is not so easy to have a clear idea of this as we have had a floating exchange rate and an inflation target for just over 25 years, and that is not long enough to have experienced so many economic cycles. It is only when the exchange rate floats that one can use the policy rate to counteract economic downturns – when the exchange rate is fixed the policy rate is in principle locked on defending the cho-sen exchange rate. A couple of the rate-cutting phases we have had during this period have also been a little unusual. What happened in 1996 in particular, when the repo rate was cut from almost 9 to just over 4 per cent, was largely a question of confidence in the inflation target become established and enabling a substan-tial cut in the policy rate. The substantial rate cut in connection with the global fi-nancial crisis, from 4.75 to 0.25 per cent within the course of a year, was also spe-cial, as crises of this kind are fortunately rare (see Figure 3).  In the United States, which has a longer history of a floating exchange rate, it is usually estimated that the policy rate is cut by around 5 percentage points in eco-nomic downturns.5 It is reasonable to assume that in Sweden, which is a small open economy, a larger share of the adjustment in an economic downturn will come through the exchange rate than is the case in the United States. Let us say, without claiming any scientific exactness, that it would be desirable to cut the repo rate by 2.5–3 percentage points in a normal economic downturn. If the downturn were to occur at the beginning of 2021 and the policy rate were cut                                                            4 Rudebusch (2016) shows that the probability of an economic upturn being broken does not now increase in proportion to the time it has lasted. However, this was the case with the economic upturns prior to the Second World War. 5 See, for example, Summers (2018). 
       4 [24]  from 0.75 to –0.5 per cent, the cut would be 1.25 percentage points, that is much less than the estimated 2.5–3 percentage points.6    Raising the repo rate to have ammunition ready? Here I should like to briefly touch on a particular question before I go on. If one is concerned that the repo rate will not be sufficiently high when the next economic downturn comes, can one not just raise it to a suitable level now, as a preventive measure – so that there is ammunition available when needed? This is an argu-ment sometimes put forward in the general debate. But unfortunately there are a number of problems with this argument. Firstly, the economy will of course be affected by interest rate increases. Growth would slow down and inflation would fall. If one raises the rate quickly and sub-stantially, one might even cause the economic downturn one was ultimately aim-ing to prevent. But even if this was not the case then, secondly, a very probable scenario would be that inflation nevertheless fell substantially, perhaps down to 1 per cent or lower, that is, to the level it was at some years ago. This could in turn mean that the credibility of the inflation target was questioned once again and economic agents would begin to expect that inflation on average would be 1 per cent rather than 2 per cent. The effect would then be in practice the same as if the target had been lowered to 1 per cent. With a lower expected rate of inflation the nominal interest rates in the economy, including the repo rate, will on average be lower. This means that in future economic downturns the distance between the repo rate and the lower bound may be smaller than before.  If the repo rate hits its lower bound earlier, and remains there for longer periods, it will be a less effective tool in counteracting economic downturns. It will be even more difficult than it is now to bring down the real interest rate as low as one might need. The essence of this is that “preventive” increases in the repo rate would ultimately not result in more ammunition, but less. It is therefore important that increases in the repo rate are not made in such a way that inflation will be tangibly lower and confidence in the inflation target is put at risk. Cut the repo rate further? Another possible means of counteracting an economic slowdown is to cut the in-terest rate more than to the −0.5 per cent level which has so far been the lowest point. It may be possible to go even lower − for instance, the policy rate in Swit-zerland is at −0.75 per cent. But personally I think the possibilities here are fairly limited.  It may not be so much a question of purely economic aspects, but rather what is feasible according to social conventions and possible to create understanding for. During the period we have had a negative repo rate, individuals have not faced negative interest rates and thus not needed to pay for having money in the bank.                                                            6 I assume here that –0.5 per cent, that is, the lowest level to which the Riksbank has ever cut the repo rate, is a lower bound for how much the rate can be cut. This assumption can of course be discussed, and I shall return to this shortly. 
       5 [24]  But if the repo rate becomes sufficiently negative, this may happen. On a theoreti-cal level, one can argue that the policy would then be more powerful and have a greater effect on the economy – that the so-called monetary policy transmission mechanism would function better. But this also risks leading to various types of problem. As I see it, the biggest problem is not the economic arguments usually raised, such as the general public wanting to empty their bank accounts and hold cash instead. Holding savings in cash is, when it comes down to it, troublesome and costly and given that most people in Sweden are getting used to living with-out cash it would not be a natural thing to do. The threshold would probably be relatively high here.  The main problem, as I see it, is another one. A couple of years ago I held a speech in which I explained why it is not necessarily more unnatural to have a negative nominal interest rate than a negative real interest rate, that is, the interest rate discounting inflation.7 Unlike a negative nominal interest rate, a negative real in-terest rate has arisen every now and then. The reason why one might think there is not such a big difference is that it is usually our purchasing power that concerns us. If one lends money, one will be able to consume less than before, both in the case of a negative real interest rate and a negative nominal interest rate. In the case of a negative real interest rate, this is because inflation is higher than the in-terest one receives, and one is therefore unable to buy as much for the sum of money one receives from the borrower. When the nominal interest rate is nega-tive, one can say that the negative return is written into the contract from the start. But seen in terms of purchasing power, a negative nominal interest rate is not very different from a negative real interest rate.   Since I held that speech we have had a negative repo rate for a further two years. My experience is that communication about the negative interest rate has not be-come easier, which I thought would be the case. Although a negative nominal in-terest rate is not more unnatural in economic terms than a negative real interest rate, it is evident that the former, unlike the latter, is perceived as going against social and economic conventions. I therefore strongly suspect that it would be dif-ficult to foster understanding for a policy that means that individuals have to “pay to save”. This is perhaps a limitation that one must simply accept. Ultimately, the legitimacy of, and confidence in, an independent institution like the Riksbank is based on the general public understanding the policy conducted, or at least not considering it to be illogical and unjust.  This does not mean that I am saying we should refrain from using the scope that there seems to be for holding the repo rate at a negative level in situations where this is necessary to avoid major costs for the economy. But there are limits as to how far the rate can be cut. And, as I said, my view is that it would be difficult to cut the rate so low that people were forced to pay to have money in the bank. Do expectations affect the future repo rate? If one has cut the repo rate as far as one considers possible, one can also try to af-fect expectations of the future repo rate among economic agents in a way that                                                            7 Jansson (2016). 
       6 [24]  stimulates demand. What I have in mind here is a strategy that is usually termed “lower-for-longer” or “makeup strategy” and which has been advocated by the previous chairman of the Federal Reserve (the US central bank) Janet Yellen.8  The idea is pretty straightforward. Let us assume that the central bank in a reces-sion has cut its policy rate as far as it considers to be possible. Exactly how low the interest rate can be set is not obvious and the assessments vary from country to country. The Federal Reserve usually regards zero as the lower bound and talks about the “zero lower bound”, while in Sweden and other countries, which have cut their policy rates below zero, we talk about the “effective lower bound”. For the sake of simplicity I will from now on refer to this simply as the “lower bound” for the policy rate.  Let us now assume that the central bank would actually have needed to cut the policy rate lower than the lower bound for monetary policy to become sufficiently expansionary. To compensate for not being able to do this, the central bank can instead hold the policy rate at the lower bound for a longer period of time (see Figure 4).9 Seen in a slightly longer perspective, for instance a ten-year period, this should give roughly the same average policy rate as if one had been able to cut the rate below the lower bound.  If the economic agents are aware that the central bank applies this strategy when the interest rate is at its lower bound, and they regard it as credible, then long in-terest rates should adapt in roughly the same way as if the lower bound did not comprise any limit.10 If one uses the reasonable assumption that demand in the economy is not solely dependent on the current level of the policy rate but also depends on interest rates with longer maturities, this should give the central bank the possibility to stimulate the economy even in times when the policy rate is at the lower bound. One advantage of the makeup strategy is that it can be applied within the frame-work of the current inflation-targeting policy. However, a condition for it to work is that it is a predictable element of the central bank’s policy. If one wishes to ap-ply such a strategy, it would therefore be a good idea to formalise it in advance by means of a strategy document describing how the central bank will act in a situa-tion where the interest rate is at its lower bound.11 In a moment I will discuss a specific application of the makeup strategy.  Moderately strict Odyssean forward guidance? When the central bank tries to give economic agents an idea of how the policy rate will develop, this is known as “forward guidance”. In Sweden the Riksbank publishes quantitative forecasts for the repo rate. This is called in academic litera-ture Delphic forward guidance, with reference to the Oracle of Delphi, who was                                                            8 Yellen (2018). The expression “lower-for-longer” is usually ascribed to Reifschneider and Williams (2000). 9 For more detailed reasoning, see for instance Söderström and Westermark (2009). 10 This follows on from the so-called expectations hypothesis, which briefly says that longer interest rates are de-termined by expectations of the future policy rate. 11 Yellen (2018) has proposed, for instance, that this could be done in the United States by means of a revision to the Federal Open Market Committee’s “Statement on Longer Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy” or by publishing a separate supplement, “Committee Guidelines for Implementing Policy at the Zero Lower Bound”.  
       7 [24]  thought to be able to see into the future. How well this strategy will function de-pends on how successful the central bank is at predicting its future interest-rate policy. If the forecasts for the policy rate are often correct, then it will be common for economic agents to believe in the central bank's forward guidance. But if the forecasts for the policy rate are not so accurate, then the forward guidance will be taken less seriously. And unfortunately it seems to be quite difficult to forecast policy rates. If the economy is hit by shocks, which is often the case, then the fore-casts will not be very accurate.  Our experiences in Sweden illustrate this problem clearly. Both the Riksbank and the market have often made substantial overestimates of the repo rate in their forecasts (see Figure 5).12 Although the market's forecasts were better than the Riksbank's during the period 2011–2013, the pattern is essentially the same – sub-stantial overestimates and inaccurate forecasts.  A brief remark is in order here. Sometimes one gets the impression from the de-bate that it is only the Riksbank that has produced inaccurate repo rate forecasts, while most analysts, including the market, have been quite successful. Apparently, this is not the case. One may perhaps object that the market may not produce forecasts of its own, but merely assumes that the Riksbank will follow its repo-rate path. But the experiences of the period 2011–2013 indicate that this is not really the case. I think this is a useful picture to bear in mind. If one wants to implement a makeup strategy in a situation where the repo rate is at the lower bound, it is probably necessary to use a more convincing approach than Delphic forward guidance. The alternative to Delphic forward guidance is called Odyssean forward guidance. This name is also taken from Greek mythology and refers to Odysseus, who had his men tie him to the mast so he would not be tempted by the song of the Sirens and steer his ship towards the cliffs. In terms of monetary policy, this strategy is less dependent on the accuracy of the forecasts; instead it is a case of committing oneself to not deviating from the interest-rate development one has indicated. But Odyssean forward guidance also has its problems. Binding oneself to a partic-ular monetary policy no matter what may on the one hand indicate strong deter-mination and thereby have an effect on expectations. But on the other hand, such a policy may appear obstinate and unrealistic. If events occur that cause the policy to appear as inappropriate or directly harmful, it will be difficult to implement it.13 And once one has deviated from a strategy which one has firmly undertaken to follow, one will hardly appear credible when trying to apply it the next time. When applying a makeup strategy, a less strict Odyssean forward guidance might mean that the central bank – in accordance with predetermined and clarified prin-ciples – makes it clear that it will hold the policy rate at the lower bound until in-flation, or perhaps some measure of the development of the real economy, has                                                            12 For more detailed analyses of the Riksbank’s experiences of publishing repo-rate forecasts, see Sveriges Riks-bank (2017a). 13 See, for instance, Bernanke (2003). 
       8 [24]  attained a particular level. In this case, one does not make an unconditional com-mitment but makes one’s behaviour depend on certain developments.14   Purchases of financial assets? One possibility the Riksbank and other central banks have made use of to make their monetary policy more expansionary when the policy rate is at or close to the lower bound is to buy government bonds on the secondary market. This affects market rates and other financial prices through various channels.15 What one nor-mally talks about are the signalling channel – which works through the purchases signalling that monetary policy will be expansionary and the repo rate will remain at the lower bound a long time, the portfolio balance channel – which means that the purchases will have contagion effects on prices of other assets and the pre-mium channel – that works through purchases reducing the supply of bonds, which pushes up bond prices so that interest rates fall. As this is a new monetary policy tool, it has given rise to extensive academic re-search that attempts to estimate its effects. The most common conclusion is that the policy has functioned more or less as expected and complemented the policy rate cuts in a useful way.16 One problem for Sweden is that it will become more difficult to use government bond purchases as a tool in the next economic downturn as the Riksbank already owns a large share of the outstanding stock of government bonds, just over 40 per cent. These are not then available for trading on the market, which contrib-utes to making the market less liquid and means it takes longer to make transac-tions. The problems have been manageable so far, but the larger share the Riks-bank owns, the greater the problems are likely to be. It may also be the case that the expansionary effect of each further purchase gradually declines. Of course, the Riksbank will eventually taper its holdings, but probably at a slow pace.17 The Riksbank will therefore most probably have a substantial holding of government bonds for a long time to come. All in all, this means that there are limits with regard to the opportunities to use purchases of government bonds as a monetary policy tool going forward. My assessment is that it will probably be pos-sible to increase the purchases a little further but, as I said, there is a limit. Buying government securities is not a completely unnatural step for a central bank that normally tries to affect the economy by adjusting a short-term risk-free interest rate, the monetary policy rate. Buying government bonds means that one                                                            14 The Federal Reserve and the Bank of England have on different occasions used conditional forward guidance. I myself applied this strategy a few years ago when I emphasised in the monetary policy discussion that I did not intend to vote in favour of raising the repo rate as long as CPIF inflation did not accelerate and exceed 1.5 per cent (see, for instance, Sveriges Riksbank, 2014). As is well known, this did not happen for some time. The fact that monetary policy decisions are often taken by a committee is a complicating circumstance in this context. 15 See for instance Alsterlind et al. (2015) for a more detailed description. 16 See, for instance, Weale and Wiedalek (2016) and De Rezende (2017). 17 See the article “The Riksbank’s strategy for a gradual normalisation of monetary policy” in Sveriges Riksbank (2017b). 
       9 [24]  also tries to affect credit risk-free interest rates, via the premium channel, alt-hough these are interest rates with both short and long maturities.18 Despite the measure being termed “unconventional”, one can say that this type of monetary policy intervention followed a standard way of thinking in that one limits oneself to trying to have an effect on risk-free interest rates, the “ground plate” for inter-est rate setting in the economy. The idea is, as when adjusting the repo rate, that the effects will spread to other, higher risk interest rates.  However, it is of course also possible, although the Riksbank has not yet done so, to buy other financial assets than government bonds. The Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan, for instance, have also purchased different types of commercial securities, including mortgage bonds and corporate bonds. Unlike purchases of government securities, this often entails a direct intervention in higher-risk assets. The market where the interven-tion takes place will then experience a “positive funding effect”, both because the interest rates on the market concerned become lower in relation to other com-mercial markets and because the issuers on the market in question have found a “safe” lender. This type of measure therefore requires a more detailed considera-tion and moreover knowledge of how different commercial markets function and are interlinked with other parts of the economy. Therefore, it is not so surprising that purchases of commercial securities have of-ten been used just when there are serious problems on a particular market and when there is a risk that these problems will have negative effects on the econ-omy as a whole. For example, the Federal Reserve purchased large amounts of mortgage bonds when this market threatened to cease functioning, which could have had serious consequences for credit supply to the household sector. Purchases of commercial paper are thus in principle a different type of measure than purchases of government paper. But they definitely comprise a possible tool to be used if the need arises, even for the Riksbank. Natural for fiscal policy to play a larger role All in all, the Riksbank will thus not be without means to counteract the next eco-nomic downturn. But it is hardly possible to claim that the opportunities are as good as they were, say, 15-20 years ago, when the neutral interest rate was still relatively high and there was plenty of scope to cut the repo rate. Depending on when the next downturn occurs and how deep it is, there is thus a risk that mone-tary policy will not suffice when it comes to counteracting it. As I see it, this has implications for how to look upon the division of roles in stabili-sation policy. There has long been a tendency, both in Sweden and abroad, to claim almost by default, that when you have a floating exchange rate it is the job of monetary policy and not fiscal policy to stabilise economic activity. Perhaps it is                                                            18 For economies with sustainable public finances, government bonds are credit-risk free. The interest rate on long maturity government bonds reflects the path of expected short-rates and compensation for other risks re-lated to the horizon of the investment and the liquidity of the bond market. 
       10 [24]  time, in the light of our experiences following the crisis, to qualify this picture somewhat.  In a way, of course, fiscal policy always contributes to stabilising economic activ-ity. For instance, systems for taxes and expenditure are often designed so that they automatically adapt to economic developments. Examples are progressive income taxes and unemployment benefits. On the other hand, there has long been scepticism against using so-called discre-tionary fiscal policy – direct decisions on adjusting taxes and public expenditure – with the aim of stabilising economic activity. One problem is that discretionary fis-cal policy measures are often implemented or have an effect too late because of various delays, and they therefore aggravate economic fluctuations rather than stabilise them. Another and perhaps even greater problem is that this type of fis-cal policy has historically tended to be used too generously and has therefore caused problems with the sustainability of public finances.19 But there may be reasons to consider that the conditions today are somewhat dif-ferent than they were a couple of decades ago. As I pointed out, one new circum-stance is that central banks now have greater difficulty counteracting economic downturns by cutting the policy rate, because of the lower bound. Another change, especially in Sweden, is that public finances are now in much better con-dition than they were before. The fiscal policy regulations introduced after the cri-sis at the beginning of the 1990s have contributed, together with good growth, to the Swedish gross public debt declining from between 70 and 80 per cent of GDP in the mid-1990s to around 40 per cent today. Thus, the prospects for using fiscal policy to counteract an economic downturn are much better nowadays.  However, it is not obvious what forms this would take. In the United Kingdom, it has been proposed that the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee should indicate when it is prevented by the lower bound from stimulating the economy as much as it considers appropriate.20 It is proposed that in these situations the committee should state how much it would have wanted to cut the policy rate. The United Kingdom's Treasury are then invited to implement a fiscal policy meas-ure of its choice as a replacement for the rate cut. The Treasury can take note of this proposal, but can also ignore it, publishing a response. If the Treasury takes the advice, then the Office for Budget Responsibility (equivalent to the Swedish Fiscal Policy Council) will assess whether the measure is compatible with a sus-tainable fiscal policy.  The idea is thus that discretionary fiscal policy measures shall replace the mone-tary policy stimulation that is not brought about because of the lower bound. Some argue that this would be a more effective and economically more reliable                                                            19 Soon after the turn of the millennium, a committee investigated how stabilisation policy should be conducted in the event of Sweden introducing the euro (Swedish Government Official Reports, 2002). The committee con-sidered that under normal economic fluctuations it would be enough to allow the automatic stabilisers to work and that discretionary fiscal policy would only be used in the case of unusually large disruptions. The reason the committee reached this conclusion was because of this type of problem. 20 See Yates (2017). 
       11 [24]  mechanism than trying to achieve the same effect through, for instance, the pur-chase of financial assets.21 It is an open question whether a similar solution might function in Sweden. One condition that one should bear in mind, as the British proposal emphasises, is that the use of discretionary fiscal policy always entails a balancing act. Sweden's cur-rently strong public finances provide protection against shocks. For some time now we are no longer affected by financial premiums that resulted from credibil-ity problems in economic policy. This can be seen, for instance, in the fact that the difference in ten-year government bond yields between Sweden and Germany is much less than before (see Figure 6). The fact that interest rates and exchange rates vary relatively little despite the dif-ficulties in forming a new government can also be regarded as an indication that the Swedish economy enjoys a high level of confidence. The fiscal policy frame-work introduced after the crisis in the 1990s is central to this stability and it is im-portant to safeguard it. Creating confidence takes a long time, but it can be lost very quickly. Having said this, it does of course feel reassuring to have fiscal policy room for manoeuvre, even if one would prefer not to use it. The role that fiscal policy should play is therefore not an uncomplicated question. But I think that it is nevertheless important that the question of how to stabilise economic activity when the Riksbank's possibilities are not unlimited is brought up on the economic policy agenda.22 Before I go on, it may be worth emphasising that yet another alternative for stim-ulating the economy that is sometimes mentioned – what is known as “helicopter money” – also requires interaction by monetary policy and financial stability. In brief, helicopter money involves the government increasing public expenditure or cutting taxes and this being funded by a permanent increase in the money stock.23 However, I have chosen to ignore this alternative as it involves considerable legal complications.  International debate on changes to the mon-etary policy framework As I mentioned at the start, there are discussions in research circles and among central banks about whether the current inflation-targeting policy should be re-formed, or replaced with some other monetary policy framework, so that the con-ditions for counteracting economic downturns and recessions will be better in the future.  This is a rather interesting discussion, not least because people who are promi-nent in the ideological debate on monetary policy or have been influential policy-makers have somewhat varying views on which solution is most appropriate. I                                                            21 See, for instance, Stirling (2018). As an aside here, it is worth mentioning that there are also some macropru-dential policy tools that could in principle be used for stabilisation purposed. However, this is not the main task of macroprudential policy and the significance of such measures should not be exaggerated. 22 See also the Fiscal Policy Council (2018). 23 See, for instance, Bernanke (2016). 
       12 [24]  have already mentioned that Janet Yellen argues that one might perhaps not need to make that many changes to the current framework and that it might suffice with a makeup strategy, where the central bank follows a formalised plan that means that the interest rate is held at the lower bound for a long time.  Temporary price level target Yellen's predecessor as chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, has pro-posed a solution that can be regarded as a special application of a makeup strat-egy.24 This is based on the central bank under certain circumstances not having a target for inflation, but instead for the development of the price level. The differ-ence may appear subtle, as inflation is the change in the price level, but it is po-tentially quite important.  Let us assume that both the inflation target and the target increase for the price level is 2 per cent. If, in an inflation-targeting regime, one has an inflation rate that undershoots the 2 per cent target for a period of time, it is the central bank's task to bring it back on target. The fact that inflation has deviated from the target before is not important – “bygones are bygones”. But if it is instead the develop-ment of the price level that is the target and inflation deviates from 2 per cent, then this must be “made up for”. The principle is thus the same as Yellen's makeup strategy, but here one has clarified in advance that the target refers to the price level rather than inflation.  The differences between a price level target and an inflation target is illustrated in Figure 7.25 If something unexpected occurs in an inflation-targeting regime that causes inflation to be lower than the target, it is enough to bring inflation back to 2 per cent again (the bottom right figure). Expressed in terms of a path for the price level, it is thus sufficient if it has the same slope as before (upper right fig-ure). It does not matter that the new path is below the original one. But if one in-stead has a price level target, one must return to the earlier path (upper left fig-ure). This means that inflation must be above 2 per cent for a period of time to compensate for the earlier period when it was below that (lower left figure).  One advantage with a price level target may thus be that economic agents will ad-just their expectations in such a way that they anticipate that a low inflation rate today will be compensated by more expansionary policy, faster growth and higher inflation in the future. The downward pressure on real interest rates caused by this alleviates the original downturn in production and inflation and speeds up the future recovery. This may of course be particularly beneficial during the periods when the lower bound sets a restraint. One disadvantage of a price level target is that the central bank cannot disregard, or “see through”, supply shocks that temporary push up inflation. As one needs to return to the same path for the price level, a period of unusually high inflation – regardless of the cause – must be followed by a contractionary policy that holds back price developments and contributes a period of unusually low inflation. The                                                            24 See Bernanke (2017a). 25 The figure is taken from Andersson and Claussen (2017), who review different alternatives to inflation target-ing. 
       13 [24]  negative supply shock may already have affected production and employment negatively and as monetary policy must also be tightened, the effect can be no-ticeable. This can make it difficult for the central bank to credibly commit itself to such a strategy. However, in the variation proposed by Bernanke, the central bank would not al-ways have a price level target, but only when the interest rate has been cut so low that the lower bound is binding – it will thus be a temporary price level target.26 In normal cases the central bank will have an ordinary inflation target of 2 per cent, just like today. The central bank’s communication can in this way continue to fo-cus on the inflation target. At the lower bound the temporary transition to a price level target can be explained and communicated in terms of keeping the policy rate at the lower bound until the average inflation since the date at which the pol-icy rate first hit zero be at least 2 percent.27 One advantage with a price level tar-get that is only applied at the lower bound is that one avoids the problem of needing to compensate for supply shocks that temporarily push up inflation, which one would need to do if the price level target always applied. Bernanke’s proposal of a temporary price level target can therefore be regarded as a special application of Yellen’s “makeup strategy”, where one aims to make the “makeup” mechanism specific and potentially more credible by formalising it in terms of a temporary new target definition for the central bank.  Higher inflation target A proposal for which Olivier Blanchard, former chief economist at the Interna-tional Monetary Fund (IMF), is one of the strongest advocates is to raise the cen-tral banks’ inflation targets.28 The idea is straightforward. With a higher inflation target, say 3 per cent, the nominal policy rate would be on average 1 percentage point higher compared to when the inflation target is 2 per cent, assuming that the new target is credible. There would therefore be a further 1 percentage point to reduce the rate before it reaches its lower bound. An increase in the inflation target to 4 per cent would increase the scope for reducing the policy rate by another percentage point, and so on. However, some argue that raising the target is not a good idea. One fear is that higher inflation would mean that inflation would also vary more, which indeed ap-                                                           26 See also, for instance, Evans (2012). 27 One might also therefore call this approach a temporary target for average inflation. A target for average infla-tion is a strategy reminiscent of a price level target, but nevertheless different in certain aspects, see Nessén and Vestin (2005) or Andersson and Claussen (2017). 28 See, for instance, Blanchard, Dell’Ariccia, and Mauro (2013). Examples of others who have advocated this are Ball (2014), Krugman (2014) and Rosengren (2015). Even Janet Yellen said during her time as chairman of the Federal Reserve that the question of whether the inflation target should be raised was “one of the most im-portant questions facing monetary policy around the world in the future” (Federal Open Market Committee, 2017, p. 14). 
       14 [24]  pears to be the case when looking at historical data. This could lead to greater un-certainty, which makes it more difficult for households and companies to make economic decisions.29  Surely, at a sufficiently high level of inflation it will be difficult to claim that infla-tion is still low and stable. But if there is confidence in a target of 3 or 4 per cent in the same way as for a target of 2 per cent, there is no obvious reason why infla-tion should vary more. The historically negative covariation between the level and stability of inflation most likely reflects the fact that periods of high inflation have also been periods in which there has been no clear anchor for inflation in the form of an inflation target.  Whether an inflation rate of 3 or 4 per cent can still be regarded as low is a ques-tion of judgement. Personally, I think one can say it is. I will return to the proposal to raise the inflation target shortly. Target for nominal GDP growth A further proposal is that the central bank should have a target for growth in nominal GDP. Larry Summers, former United States Secretary of the Treasury and an active debater on many economic policy issues, is one of those who have advo-cated this.30  Nominal GDP is a measure that reflects both price and volume. Growth in nominal GDP is in principle the same as the sum of the change in prices, in other words in-flation, and the growth in output volume, that is, real GDP growth.31 One advantage sometimes highlighted is that a nominal growth target “automati-cally” takes into account the real economy as monetary policy in this case puts as much emphasis on growth in the real economy as on inflation. When real GDP growth is low, the central bank conducts an expansionary policy to maintain the nominal growth target – and vice versa when growth is high. As I see it, however, this is not a decisive difference in relation to flexible inflation targeting, which nor-mally takes into account the real economy in a way that stabilises economic activ-ity. In a more long-term perspective, one can view a nominal growth target as mean-ing that the central bank has an implicit target for inflation, given the growth po-tential of the economy. For instance, a target for nominal GDP growth of 5 per cent and a growth potential of 3 per cent will implicitly entail an inflation target of 2 per cent. One advantage put forward on the basis of this is that a nominal growth target can provide a desirable adjustment even to more long-term                                                            29 See Cecchetti and Schoenholtz (2017). For a more detailed review of different types of criticism, see Yellen (2015) (footnote 14) and Bernanke (2017b). 30 Summers (2018). However, it is interesting to note that one of Summers’ arguments in favour of a target for nominal GDP growth (of 5-6 per cent) is that it: ”would attenuate the issues around explicitly announcing a higher inflation target, which I think are a little problematic on political economy grounds”. Examples of other advocates are Scott Sumner and Jeffrey Frankel (see, for instance, Sumner, 2011 and Frankel, 2012). Another var-iation on this is that the target should instead concern the level of nominal GDP. For a discussion of this and other target definitions that I do not take up here, see Andersson and Claussen (2017). 31 Inflation is in this case measured according to the so-called GDP deflator. 
       15 [24]  changes in the economy. If, for example, the growth potential declines, it is proba-ble that the neutral real interest rate will fall. But the lower growth potential means that with a nominal growth target one also has a higher implicit inflation target, which in turn should make it easier to attain a negative real interest rate and an expansionary monetary policy in situations when this is needed. The effect would thus be similar to the increase in the inflation target I talked about ear-lier.32 A number of disadvantages of having a nominal growth target have also been put forward. One fairly major problem is that nominal GDP is published with a long time lag and revised substantially and often. The fact that the data revisions are substantial is illustrated in Figure 2, where you can see that outcome adjustments on a quarterly basis can often be around 1 percentage point and in some cases a lot more than this. In the US data the revisions appear to be somewhat smaller, but even here it is a question of substantial differences between preliminary and adjusted figures. This naturally creates major difficulties for a monetary policy that has a target expressed in this way.  Another problem is that inflation expectations risk being poorly anchored with a nominal growth target. Inflation will probably vary quite substantially and there is no explicit quantified level of inflation that helps to anchor expectations. There is ultimately a risk that this will prompt a deterioration in the conditions for price-setting and wage formation. This is an important argument, especially in a country like Sweden, where instability in wage formation was previously a major problem. Finally, some argue that it would be much more difficult to communicate what a target for nominal GDP growth actually entails than it is to communicate a target for inflation. My reflections on amendments to the framework The fact that the different proposals for amendments in the monetary policy framework all have their advocates among well-reputed economists shows that there are advantages and disadvantages with all of them and that none is clearly better than the others. Personally, I believe, as I said at the beginning, that one needs to think very care-fully before changing the current framework at all. One must be very certain that one has come to the end of the road, and we probably aren't there yet, as I see it. For instance, many of the problems I have taken up will be resolved, or at least al-leviated, if the global neutral interest rate rises. Although most people believe that it will be low for a long time to come, there are also those who believe an up-turn is not that far away.33                                                             32 Disregarding this long-term argument it is not obvious how a target for nominal GDP growth will contribute to resolving, or even alleviating, the problem of the interest rate’s lower bound. 33 For example, Goodhart and Pradhan (2017) say that global demographic trends in the coming decade will turn around the downward trend in the global neutral interest rate. 
       16 [24]  Higher inflation target a natural further development But if I were nevertheless forced to take a stand, I would say that I lean towards raising the inflation target as the most natural means of further developing the monetary policy framework. When it comes down to it, the inflation-targeting policy has functioned well for a long time, and problems only arose when there was difficulty making policy sufficiently expansionary, as a result of the lower bound, after the financial crisis. Raising the target would solve, or at least reduce, this problem. It would also only affect one parameter of the framework and would not entail any extensive revision of it. This means it would not be necessary to try to convince and explain the merits of a new system and deal with potential adjustment costs and teething problems. It is not always an advantage to hold on to as much of an old system as possible, but in this case I think it would be a good idea. Would the economic agents accept an inflation rate of 3-4 per cent? I think they would, especially as it would entail less of a negative interest rate in the future – something we now know from experience is perceived as unnatural and problem-atic in several ways. It could also reasonably mean that it would be less probable that one needs to employ purchases of various financial assets as a complement to policy rate cuts. Although the criticism of this part of the policy may not have been as sharp as the criticism of the negative interest rate, it has still arisen. As I said before, it has been claimed that the Riksbank is creating liquidity problems for participants in the government securities market, and also that we are over-stepping the mark and beginning to conduct fiscal policy. If new asset purchases were to concern assets other than government bonds, which is a possibility as the Riksbank's holdings of government bonds will be substantial for a foreseeable fu-ture, the criticism would probably intensify. Making monetary policy interventions aimed at various risky market rates is as I said a completely different matter than limiting oneself to interventions in government bond yields, which like normal repo-rate policy concern risk-free interest. But is it realistic to assume that an inflation target of 3-4 per cent is at all possi-ble? When it comes down to it, central banks have had difficulty in attaining their current targets of around 2 per cent. My view here is that there are no obvious limits when it comes to the choice of level of the inflation target, in any case not regarding the percentages we are talking about. Inflation is determined in the long run by the monetary policy that is conducted on average and the effects of this policy on inflation expectations. Established “truths” of this kind are certainly reconsidered and revised now and then, but only after being refuted by extensive and comprehensive theoretical and empirical evidence. There is no such evidence available at present. In addition, inflationary pressures have recently begun to rise at last in several countries and we now appear to be entering a situation similar to what was normal prior to the financial crisis.34                                                            34 Jansson (2017) contains a more detailed discussion of the possibilities for monetary policy to continue attain-ing the inflation target. 
       17 [24]  Temporary price level target – tempting but probably too com-plex One practical complication with raising the inflation target is that it would be diffi-cult for an individual country to move on its own away from the prevailing norm of 2 per cent.35 One problem, not least from the point of view of communication, is if other countries did not follow our example we would have a higher target that the world around us and this would mean, all else being equal, that the ex-change rate constantly weakened. From this perspective, it would perhaps be easier for an individual country to begin to apply the temporary price level target that Bernanke advocated. This means that inflation targeting is conducted as usual in normal times and the tar-get definition is modified only when the lower bound is reached.  For economists, the proposal of a temporary price level target is probably tempt-ing in many ways, but the question is whether it would function in practice. I am rather doubtful. The purpose of the proposal is to get inflation expectations to rise “automatically” when the policy rate reaches the lower bound. This would push down real interest rates and thereby increase the probability of the lower bound not creating too many problems. But for this to work requires a lot from the communication of the central bank as well as from economic agents’ ability to take in and comprehend the temporary change in the formulation of the target. Such a change could even be counterproductive in that it would become more dif-ficult rather than easier to understand what monetary policy involves. Raising the inflation target would of course also entail problems. However, my as-sessment is that it is easier to affect inflation expectations by stating a clear figure to aim at. There are a number of earlier examples that this has been possible in practice. Admittedly, this has usually concerned bringing down inflation expecta-tions, but that is no simple task either. Not least in the case of Sweden, there were strong headwinds and considerable doubts that we would succeed. My most important message Let me conclude by briefly summarising my most important messages. In the short term, within the current framework, the Riksbank has a number of tools to counteract the next economic downturn. But the low neutral interest rate, com-bined with need to conduct a very expansionary policy in recent years, may create certain problems, depending on how soon the downturn comes and how deep it is. In a situation where the Riksbank's monetary policy scope is not unlimited, it is important that the question of how an economic downturn shall be counteracted is on the economic policy agenda. There are currently large reserves in fiscal pol-icy, but using them is not unproblematic.  If low real interest rates persist, it may in the longer run become necessary to modify the monetary policy framework with the 2 per cent inflation target that                                                            35 It is fairly common, especially among emerging market economies, to lower the inflation target as confidence in the inflation-targeting regime increases. However, there are few examples of countries that have raised their inflation target (see, for instance, Apel, Armelius and Claussen, 2017).  
       18 [24]  most central banks currently apply. Of the various proposals circulating in interna-tional debate, I am currently leaning towards a raised inflation target being the best option. At the same time as this would alleviate the problem that the repo rate cannot always be cut as much as needed, it is also relatively undramatic and straightforward. But this does not mean that it is something I feel we should do soon. A fairly major problem is that it is difficult to make this kind of change inde-pendently of other countries. But it is always good to be well-prepared in advance and it is therefore worth starting to think about possible modifications already to-day.

Ong Chong Tee: The post-crisis financial landscape - what next?Remarks by Mr Ong Chong Tee, Deputy Managing Director (Financial Supervision) of theMonetary Authority of Singapore, at the Society for Financial Studies Cavalcade Asia-PacificConference's Gala Dinner, Singapore, 13 December 2018.*   *   *Professor Laura Starks – President, Society for Financial StudiesProfessor Ron Masulis – Program ChairProfessor Jun-Koo Kang – Associate Chair, Nanyang Technological UniversityProfessor Bernard Yeung – Dean and Stephen Riady Distinguished Professor, NationalUniversity of Singapore, President, Asian Bureau of Financial & Economic ResearchProfessor Massimo Massa – The Rothschild Chaired Professor of Banking, INSEADAssociate Professor Johan Sulaeman – Dean’s Chair, Department of Finance, NUSBusiness SchoolLadies and gentlemen, a very good evening. Thank you for inviting a few of my MAS colleaguesand I to be here tonight.Introduction1     The SFS Cavalcade conference is a distinguished forum that brings together some of thesharpest minds in the world of finance and research.2     This evening, I thought I could share some perspectives of a financial regulator. My hope isto flag a few pertinent issues that could do well with more research insights and discussion. Asthe great Hungarian scientist Albert Szent-Gyorgyi once said: “Research is four things: brainswith which to think, eyes with which to see, machines with which to measure and fourth, money”. I am sure that each of you will adequately deal with the money bit, but our collective minds andtools in financial studies that all of you have can do much to raise the understanding of theprospects and challenges for the financial system.3     One decade ago, we had the global financial crisis (GFC). As Samuelson described itstarkly: “what we know about the global financial crisis is that we do not know very much”. Withthe benefit of hindsight, vulnerabilities had indeed built up from:(a) Highly leveraged financial institutions;(b) Severe liquidity mismatches;(c) Fairly opaque over-the-counter derivatives markets that transmitted risks rapidly when liquiditysuddenly dried up; as well as(d) Moral hazards associated with financial institutions that were deemed “too big to fail”.4     Ten years on, a number of key regulatory reforms are being implemented in stages toaddress these vulnerabilities.5     Take for example, the Basel III reforms after the GFC, a key work of the Basel Committee onBanking Supervision, of which I am a member of. Many of you may be familiar with its keyelements to improve the quality and quantity of bank capital. The Basel III standards also seek toreduce excessive variability of banks’ risk-weighted assets. It has now incorporatedmacroprudential and liquidity risk elements. A new minimum leverage ratio is included. GlobalSystemically Important Banks are further subjected to even higher capital levels, more intense 1 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
supervision and resolution planning requirements.6     By many measures, the global banking system is more resilient. For example, compared toearlier this decade, Common Equity Tier 1 risk-weighted assets of internationally active banksstand at around 13%, from about 7% before. Their leverage ratios average about 6% now, fromless than 2% previously.Implementation of post-crisis regulatory reforms7     We should also remember that the global banking regulatory standards are minimumrequirements. National supervisors can use other levers of the Basel framework to apply higherstandards or additional requirements on their banks, as appropriate, based on idiosyncraticconsiderations.8     There is a general consensus that the financial system is safer than before. But the follow-on question can be: safer, yes – but is the system safe enough?9     To say that regulators have addressed all that can go wrong would be great hubris. Indeed,this will be contrary to the evolving and adaptive nature of financial activity. The reality is arecurrence of financial crises in economic history. I would add that no amount of regulations andsupervision can prevent crises; what regulators seek to do is to reduce the likelihood andnegative impact from one. This will require banking regulators to remain vigilant against emergingrisks, and hence the importance of forward-looking supervision to complement regulations.10     On the other hand, with the last global financial crisis becoming a distant shadow of sorts,there are already calls that “this time it is different” and to dial down the enhanced regulatoryrequirements – just as all the crises before it.11     Two weeks ago, at a forum of the International Conference of Banking Supervisors, SirJohn Vickers (who oversaw the Vickers Report to reform the UK banking market) shared hisviews that the Basel III capital requirements are not stringent enough, and have not sufficientlyreduced the likelihood of crises as intended. I am not saying that this is the view of the MAS. I amsure that many bankers will disagree. But the point is that this is an area which is deserving ofgreater discourse.12     Evaluating the effects of the banking reforms will be a key exercise. One set of issuesrevolve around whether the reforms are having the intended outcomes or, on the other hand,whether there are unforeseen and undesirable effects. This will involve an assessment of banks’behavioural responses, whether there are new forms of arbitrage strategies, and the spillovereffects on the broader economy.Cross-border lending to developing economies13     One example relates to the impact on cross-border lending to developing economies.14     There are studies that indicate that some global banks have reduced their presence andactivities in developing economies as part of their business review, and some have attributed thisto the banking reforms. Establishing a clear, causal link between the declining trend in cross-border bank loans to developing economies and the post-crisis reforms will be helpful, ifpossible.15     Such investigations can support the Basel Committee’s work on a full, timely andconsistent implementation of the reforms globally.The increasing role of market-based finance in credit provision16     The decline in bank inflows to developing economies has been partially offset by these 2 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
economies relying more on market-based finance, or non-bank financial intermediation. In myview, this is a positive development since a more diverse funding system comprising bank-basedfinance and market-based finance can possibly better meet the changing needs of the realeconomy. 17     But the increased prominence of market-based finance has also led to some concerns thatlarge redemptions from open-ended funds can potentially pose liquidity risks and hencedestabilise financial markets.18     International organisations and standard-setting bodies such as the Financial StabilityBoard (FSB), International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) and BaselCommittee have sought to assess the potential financial stability risks posed by market-basedfinance. The FSB, for example, developed a set of policy recommendations to address structuralvulnerabilities of open-ended funds, and IOSCO is reviewing these recommendations.19     There can be other related areas that merit further investigation, including from academia.For example, the interaction between market-based finance and traditional asset managementactivities, and the effect on underlying markets in which these are invested.Evaluating the impact of macroprudential policies20     A key element of the Basel III reforms is its macroprudential framework to assess newsystem-wide risks and the use of a countercyclical capital buffer if warranted. In addition,macroprudential policies have become integral to many central banks’ policy toolkits. Variousjurisdictions in Asia such as Singapore, Hong Kong, and Indonesia have used macroprudentialmeasures to reduce risks to their domestic financial systems and to dampen the impact ofeconomic shocks, such as the application of loan-to-value limits for mortgage borrowings.However, the detailed impact of macroprudential policies is arguably less well understood.21     There are research challenges in this regard. For example, the Bank for InternationalSettlements (BIS) highlighted that the impact of tools are likely to vary across jurisdictions basedon their domestic circumstances and phase of the financial cycle. A key focus area is how bestto study the spillover impact across jurisdictions from a macroprudential policy decision point ofview.22     Another challenge relates to effectiveness. Macroprudential tools have largely beenemployed in more recent years, and isolating their effectiveness from other measures will requirefurther studies.23     In this context, it may be remiss of me not to mention the apparent artificial divide that hasexisted between the analysis of the financial vis-à-vis the real sides of the economy. During theGFC, I recall some criticism that economists used mathematical models that did not sufficientlyfactor the critical roles that banks and other financial institutions play in the economy.24     Since then, important strides have been made, including in the workhorse DynamicStochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models used at central banks, to better capture the keyinteractions between the financial sector and the rest of the economy. This is most pertinent forregulators and for central banks’ work in economy-wide forecasting, policy analysis and scenariosimulation. I would also encourage further research in this area, including developing empirically-validated feedback relationships that can be embedded into models for stress testing purposes.Evaluating the impact of FinTech25     Turning now to a recent pet topic of interest – FinTech. Much has been written and reportedon technology innovations that have and will continue to disrupt business models. There are alsomany views around disruptions to jobs and on socio-economic relationships. 3 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
26     Let me make some brief comments on MAS’ regulatory stance towards innovation infinancial services. For any innovation or a new technology-based business model to take off, itmust be purposeful and value creating.27     For example, there are FinTech entities that have entered the financial inclusion space,especially in the rural areas, and boosted economic growth.28     There are other examples. Robo-advisory services can allow investors greater access tocustomised, low-cost financial advice. Other initiatives like open banking can provide potentialbenefits to a broad range of consumers by allowing for the easy portability of data and paymentinstructions. The use of distributed ledger technology, or blockchain, may replace traditionalcentral party systems or intermediaries by creating alternative trusted platforms. Suchblockchain-based immutable transaction and account records may help to facilitate cross-bordertransactions, by cutting costs and settlement time without compromising on security andcertainty.29     There is no contradiction between regulation for safety and prudence vis-à-vis  regulationsthat are open to, or supportive of, good financial innovations. These may be new businessmodels or use of a technology that promote competition, improve customer experiences orsimply a more efficient or pleasant delivery of services. So far from adopting a Luddite instinct,many financial regulators have in fact set up dedicated teams to both support and to monitor newFinTech developments.30     But as with any innovation in any era, FinTechs can also bring about new risks. In thisregard, international organisations such as the International Monetary Fund, FSB, IOSCO and theBasel Committee have all produced several useful public reports on the potential risks.31     As examples of new risk typologies, there may be increased vulnerabilities to anti-moneylaundering and efforts to counter the financing of terrorism, given the anonymity of digitalcurrencies. Cyber-security is another area as FinTechs vary in size and risk managementcapabilities. There can also be an increase in macro-financial risks from contagion,procyclicality, or excess volatility given the increased speed of financial transactions, and newnetworks of relationships. Open banking and the ease of moving funds can also lead topotentially destabilising movements of money, posing liquidity risks.32     I welcome more research and studies to guide such developments. It is probably too earlyto determine whether and how FinTechs or BigTechs may change the behaviour of incumbentfinancial institutions. It is also not unreasonable to expect that traditional business lines betweenfinancial services, general commerce or telecoms will increasingly be blurred – and activitiesmay concentrate in the biggest institutions with superior competitive advantages including in theareas of talent, customer base, and customer data. The FAANGs and BATs of this world – thetechnology giants – come to mind. These may also have implications for financial stability.Indeed, the next systemically important institution could be a BigTech with roots in e-commerce,and therefore, whether such entities require some form of oversight by financial regulators infuture.33     With the increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) and various forms of data analytics(DA), another area of focus will be around the governance of their use. The MAS recentlyreleased a guide that we co-created with some industry partners on a set of principles forFairness, Ethics, Accountability and Transparency (or FEAT) in the use of “AIDA”. Whether andhow the increasing use of machine-learning systems (both supervised and unsupervised),algorithms and data-driven insights can affect behaviours and decision-making in financialinstitutions will be a rich area for research and attention. Regulators generally like the idea ofdeploying smart systems that can do a better job in risk detection or risk management. But whatabout for business decisions or say, personnel decisions? Whether AI-driven systems willperpetuate bias and discrimination is also ripe for more extensive studies. 4 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
34     Another field of research work can be around central bank digital currencies, or to use thebuzz word, CBDC. Globally, there has been some discussion on the potential implications ofCBDCs, but this is still relatively green field thinking. I will not delve more into it as the subject canbe a seminar theme in and of itself.Conclusion35     As you will have realised, I have flagged more questions than answers this evening. I thinkthe post-crisis financial landscape is an exciting time to be an economist, analyst or researcherin support of financial market development, as well as to help shape policy reviews and thinking.Many of the developments I have touched on are rapidly evolving, and are also not mutuallyexclusive from one another.36     There is a view that we should accept a more central role incorporating beliefs andexpectations to both understand and shape financial market developments. New advances inbehavioural economics can provide for tractable and psychologically-founded models of beliefsto be integrated into the standard analytical frameworks in finance and macroeconomics.37     It is important that policymakers and regulators have a firm grasp of these interactions anddevelop new techniques to calibrate policies and mitigate risks.38     The MAS therefore welcomes the opportunity to further engage the research community,hopefully with many of you, so that with your knowledge, expertise and research rigour, we candeepen our collective learning and understanding.39     As an example, recently we collaborated with the Asian Bureau of Finance and EconomicResearch (ABFER) and NUS Business School to bring together global academics for ourWorkshop on Digital Currency Economics and Policy. I encourage more of such forums. In fact, Iwould not be surprised if the themes I have touched on have been discussed in research forumsand this Cavalcade.40     Thank you. 5 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
  Remarks by Ms Caroline Abel Governor of the Central Bank of Seychelles at the  Opening of the CBS 40th Anniversary Exhibition 7 November 2018 Venue: International Conference Centre of Seychelles   President of the Court of Appeal Principal Secretaries Board Members, Management and Staff of the Central Bank of Seychelles, Distinguished Guests Ladies and Gentlemen  Good morning.  It gives me great pleasure to welcome you all here today, on behalf of the Central Bank of Seychelles, to the opening of this exhibition being held in commemoration of the 40th Anniversary of the establishment of a central banking institution in Seychelles.  The Seychelles Monetary Authority, the precursor to the Central Bank of Seychelles, was established a mere two years after Seychelles gained its independence.  This was the ultimate act that validated us as a sovereign state, with the ability to issue currency, manage our reserves, inspect banks and financial institutions and perhaps most importantly, set our own monetary policy objectives. 
Fast forward forty years, and we are proud to say that we have achieved a lot in a relatively short space of time.  Through various technical assistance, capacity building exercises and exchanges with other central banks in the region, the Central Bank of Seychelles has evolved into a well-respected institution, both at home and abroad.  One notable achievement is that Seychelles is the most financially included country in the SADC region, based on a study conducted in 2016.  This means that our financial system is on the right path to ensure that all individuals and businesses have access to financial services and products that are affordable and that meets their specific needs.  On the flip side of the coin, we face many challenges, some of which emanate from within our organisation, while others are unavoidable consequences of factors on the global market, to which our island economy is acutely susceptible.  However, as a central bank, we cannot allow ourselves to fall in the face of these adversities, but rather, we strive to turn those challenges into opportunities for positive change.  One of the biggest challenges that we’ve had to face during the four decades of our existence, was the global financial crisis of 2008.  Our debt-to-GDP ratio was at 151.3% in September of that year and our external reserves had depleted to below one month of imports as at October 2008.  The country then embarked on a macroeconomic programme with the support of the IMF and as the saying goes, the rest is history.  In a mere ten years, we have steered clear of that crisis and have become one of the success stories not only in our region, but in the world.  Nevertheless, we do not allow ourselves to become complacent, as the post-crisis era in which we currently find ourselves, has its own set of challenges that we need to deal with.  The title of our 40th Anniversary Exhibition, “A modern Central Bank with a Focus on Financial Empowerment”, speaks to the new challenges that we are tackling.  While our objective to promote domestic price stability, our vision to become a model Central Bank and our mission to contribute towards the 
economic growth and development of Seychelles, all remain unchanged, we are keenly aware that we need to constantly evolve to meet public expectations and to keep abreast with innovation in the financial sector.  It is of utmost importance that as a Central Bank, we modernize the way we deliver our mandate and ensure that we provide the public with the capacity to understand the newer products and services that are at their disposal, to enable them to make informed decisions.  Ladies and Gentlemen,  Innovation and the introduction of newer products alone can only take us so far.  What has enabled the success of the Central Bank of Seychelles is the hard work, conviction and dedication of its staff.  Today, we have 200 men and women who work tirelessly around the clock to ensure the stability of our financial sector.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank each and every one of these 200 individuals, as well as the former Governors and staff members for their contribution to the development and growth of the Central Bank of Seychelles.  The display in today’s exhibition is a testament to the achievements of all those who have had the privilege to walk the halls of the Central Bank building.  It also showcases the evolution of the Central Bank over the past 40 years and indicates of the path that we aim to follow in the coming decades.  On this note, I would like to officially declare this exhibition open and invite you all to peruse through the contents and interact with our members of staff who are on hand to respond to any queries that you may have.  Thank you.

We are all aware that national language is an important ingredient of any culture and most effective mode of communication in a country. With this in perspective, translation of global standards into our national language is an important milestone, as it would remove language barriers to understand Shariah Standards. I believe this Urdu version of the Shariah Standards will be instrumental in improving awareness about Islamic finance especially amongst the Shariah scholars, academia and practitioners of Islamic finance. The scholars and all other experts involved in this project deserve great appreciation for their commendable role.   As we are all aware, Islamic Finance Industry is relatively new to the Global Financial Landscape. Events like these are important not only for dissemination and awareness but also reinforce the emerging significance of fast growing Islamic Finance.   
Page 2 of 6  Ladies & Gentlemen!  Islamic banking started initially as a niche market for the faith sensitive clientele and is now increasingly becoming an integral component of global financial system. Islamic finance industry has grown at a fast pace. The development of Islamic banking industry especially beyond Muslim jurisdictions is a recognition of its viability as a competitive alternate to the conventional banking. According to Financial Stability Report 2018 issued by Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB), its asset base has grown by 8.3 percent to surpass US$ 2 trillion mark. With expanding scope and size of Islamic finance, and emerging global challenges, it is gaining importance from financial stability perspective. Inherent strengths of being asset backed and prohibition on speculative activities in Islamic finance lead to better resilience of Islamic banking institutions against excessive risks. However, these strengths alone may not be sufficient to immunize the Islamic finance from risks associated with deficiencies in due diligence, inadequate buffers, lack of transparency and weak risk management practices. The well thought out international standards issued by the global standard setting bodies like AAOIFI and IFSB facilitate in managing the challenges facing the Islamic finance and harmonizing the industry practices.   Against the backdrop of growth of Islamic banking globally, our domestic industry is also demonstrating quite impressive headway. The industry has posted a healthy annual growth of over 20 percent during the last five years. The market share of Islamic banking industry stands at 13.6 percent in terms of banking assets and 14.7 percent in total deposits. Islamic banking industry has expanded its network to over 2700 branches in 111 districts across the country.   Given the potential of Islamic finance to support broad based economic growth and our constitutional obligation to make available Islamic financial services in the country, Islamic banking has remained a priority area for State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).    I feel pride in sharing that the sound foundations of legal and regulatory environment laid down by the State Bank of Pakistan has played a key role in sustained high growth of Islamic banking in the country. Our Shariah compliance environment is considered amongst 
Page 3 of 6  the best in the world. It encompasses a comprehensive Shariah Governance framework consisting of establishment of Shariah Board, Shariah compliance department and Shariah internal audit in Islamic banking institutions supported with Shariah external audits and SBP regular inspections. Let me also apprise you that SBP regularly reviews the regulatory framework to make sure that it is aligned with international standards and best practices and at the same time caters to the evolving needs of the industry.   State Bank of Pakistan also believes that growth and development of other elements of Islamic finance ecosystem i.e. capital markets, mutual funds and takaful, is essential not only for Islamic banking industry but also for the overall growth and development of the country. In this regard, SBP regularly collaborates with Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), the capital market’s regulator, to promote Islamic finance. We appreciate and acknowledge key steps taken by SECP in last few years including establishment of Islamic Finance Department, introduction of all share Islamic Index, issuance of Takaful rules and Sukuk guidelines. We believe that these measures shall facilitate the diversity and outreach of the Islamic finance.  Ladies & Gentlemen!  At this stage, let me highlight few potential risks and challenges that Islamic banking industry need to address for its sustainability and stability. Effective liquidity management has been the key challenge of Islamic banking industry. This issue has gained more prominence owing to factors like dearth of Shariah compliant investment opportunities, limited availability of Shariah compliant money market instruments and absence of Shariah compliant SBP standing facility. In Pakistan, sovereign sukuk being issued since 2008 provide the key liquidity management avenue to the domestic industry, however, demand for such instruments far surpasses their supply. Being cognizant of this challenge, SBP, in consultation with industry is working to develop alternate solutions for liquidity management for Islamic banking industry.   The inherent advantage of Islamic financial industry to fund projects on equity participation and profit sharing basis enables it to cater to the huge, unmet demands of underserved sectors such as agriculture and SMEs. However, like conventional industry, Islamic banks are also not effectively serving these sectors. KAP (Knowledge, Attitude and Practices of 
Page 4 of 6  Islamic Banking in Pakistan) survey based study of SBP, also indicates these areas as potential growth avenues for Islamic banking industry. SBP is persuading the industry to capitalize on its innate strengths to cater to the needs of these underserved sectors.    Housing finance is another attractive avenue for Islamic banks.  Increased focus of incumbent government on this sector provides Islamic Banks an opportunity to diversify their asset portfolio. I am confident that present conducive environment provides opportunity to Islamic banking industry to tap potential in low income housing through Diminishing Musharaka instruments. This would also pave the way towards the ultimate objective of Islamic finance. i.e. Maqasid-e- Shariah.    Another major issue restraining Islamic banking from realizing its true potential is lack of qualified and trained Islamic bankers. To tackle this issue, SBP is not only offering training courses on its own and through its training subsidiary-National Institute of Banking and Finance (NIBAF), but is also supporting industry in such initiatives. We have also collaborated and sponsored three Centers of Excellence in Islamic Finance Education (CEIFEs) at well renowned educational institutions- IBA Karachi, LUMS Lahore, and IM Sciences Peshawar. These institutions are fully operational and they are providing regular supply of trained human resource as well as conducting training programs for enhancing capacity of the existing human resource of the industry.   Another important challenge for the Islamic finance industry, as identified in the KAP study, is lack of awareness among masses on demand side. As such a robust awareness campaign about Islamic banking is necessary for promoting Islamic banking. SBP is focusing on addressing this challenge through multipronged strategy; it is conducting various mass awareness programs and focused group discussions all over the country and supporting the industry and other related stakeholders for such initiatives. However, this is one area in which Islamic banks have also to play a far more proactive role.  Ladies & Gentlemen!  As I mentioned earlier, standardization in Islamic finance is essential for addressing various issues facing the Islamic finance in addition to promote disclosure, transparency and integration into global financial system. I think the rapid growth of Islamic banking and 
Page 5 of 6  finance requires further strengthening of its financial infrastructure. This will augment the ongoing efforts to bring the infrastructure of Islamic financial industry up to the international standards. The alignment of Islamic finance industry with the global best practices would not only help supervisors in their tasks but will also foster the integration of Islamic financial institutions into the international financial community.  I would like to highlight here the commendable role AAOIFI has played in development and promotion of Shariah, accounting and governance standards to facilitate the growth of Islamic financial services industry. AAOIFI has also been instrumental in enhancing awareness of Islamic banking and finance globally through knowledge sharing and organizing capacity building programs, workshops, conferences, and seminars. Considering the constant changing dynamics in financial sphere, AAOIFI also reviews and updates its standards to keep them relevant. AAOIFI’s enhanced coordination with relevant stakeholders and increased collaborative efforts help Islamic financial services industry to grow on sound footings.   The AAOIFI role in capacity building through offering Shariah based certifications in the area of Auditing, Accounting and advisory services is laudable. Such certifications provide the much needed qualified resources for effective implementation of the Shariah standards.  SBP has long standing association with AAOIFI. As a member of the AAOIFI’s Board of Trustee, State Bank contributes in the overall oversight and supervision of its operations. Our officials participate as both speakers and participants in different knowledge sharing and capacity building initiatives. So far SBP has adopted 6 of the AAOIFI’s standards while another 8 to 10 standards are in the final stages of implementation. Besides, SBP has advised the banks to refer the AAOIFI’s standards for guidance in different areas of Islamic finance.  Given the commitment and concerted efforts of all stakeholders, I am optimistic that Islamic banking and finance is likely to maintain its positive growth trajectory. The growth of Islamic finance on its distinct strengths would bring more stability to the financial system, improve equitable distribution of economic gains, and support overall economic development. I believe events and steps like these are vital steps towards achieving this goal; hence, we should not stop here and but continue to work towards establishing an ethical financial system.   
Page 6 of 6   At the end, I would like to reiterate that State Bank of Pakistan will continue to extend its full cooperation and play due role for achieving our shared vision of a vibrant and sustainable Islamic banking sector in Pakistan.   Thank you! ********************************************************************************************   
 BANK OF UGANDA      Remarks  By  Professor Emmanuel Tumusiime-Mutebile,  Governor, Bank of Uganda    at the   Uganda Bankers’ Association (UBA) Informal Dinner   Held at the Residence of the Managing Director, KCB Bank Uganda Limited, Kololo, Kampala           Friday November 09, 2018 
 2 Our host, The Managing Director, KCB Uganda Limited, Chairman of Uganda Bankers’ Association, Chief Executive Officers of Financial Institutions, Executive Director of Uganda Bankers Association, Senior Managers and Staff from Bank of Uganda, Invited Guests,  Ladies and Gentlemen  Good evening,  It is a pleasure to be with you this evening for yet another informal Uganda Bankers’ Association Dinner.   Mark Twain once remarked that “a man’s character may be learned from the adjectives which he habitually uses in conversation”. You can tell from the last couple of informal dinners that I am happy with the progress we have made as the Supervised Financial Institutions (SFIs) sector over the last quarter.   But before I reveal the reasons for my happiness, I thank the Managing Director of KCB Bank Uganda Limited for hosting us this evening. I am grateful to the organisers of this informal dinner for the wonderful experience.  
 3 Tonight, I would like to focus on the significant events that the Supervised Financial Services Sector has had to deal with since July 2018 when we last interacted.  I thank the Uganda Bankers’ Association for supplementing the Bank of Uganda (BoU) efforts in promoting the implementation of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 9. I have been informed that the UBA successfully organised the Chief Financial Officers’ (CFO’s) symposium on IFRS 9 on September 13, 2018 in which BoU fully participated.    I am happy to note that the symposium was very fruitful as it provided valuable insights and sharing of practical experiences in the implementation of the IFRS 9 in other jurisdictions. I recognize the efforts and distinction of UBA in identifying a resourceful facilitator who is a member of the International Accounting Standards Board Implementation Task Force for IFRS 9.  Bank of Uganda continued its efforts to enhance the supervisory and regulatory environment through the publication of the Financial Institutions (Capital Adequacy) Regulations, 2018 in the Gazette. The new Capital Adequacy Regulations will now require Commercial Banks and Credit Institutions to take into account the capital charge for market risk in addition to the existing credit risk capital charge.  
 4 Accordingly, effective September 30, 2018 the minimum on-going core capital requirements was enhanced from 8 percent to 10 percent of the total risk adjusted assets plus risk adjusted off balance sheet items for Commercial Banks and Credit Institutions. The achievement of this milestone marks the point of full implementation of Basel I Capital Accord by BoU.  In furtherance of the implementation of the Basel standards in the Supervisory framework, the Bank of Uganda will now focus on enhancing the implementation of the Basel II Capital Accord. The BoU has implemented some of the pre-conditions for Pillar II of the Basel II Capital Accord, which is enshrined in the legal and supervisory framework.   The BoU embraced the Risk Based Methodology, which mandates the Board with the responsibility to ensure that a sound risk management framework is in place. While these form good foundation for determination of the adequacy of the capital position based on the risk profile, the body of work is not yet complete. For example, there is considerable work to be done in the implementation of Pillar II requirements for Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Program (ICAAP) as well as capital charge for operational risk based on the standardised approach.  
 5 With regard to market discipline, there exists a rigorous information disclosure requirement stipulated in the Financial Institutions Act (FIA) 2004 as amended and implementing regulation on the requirements for disclosure in final annual accounts, risk management policies, publication of bank charges, financial consumer protection. However, full implementation of market discipline requires adoption of Pillar I of Basel II Accord.  As part of the financial markets development plan, the Bank of Uganda recently approved the proposal to make Deposit Auctions marketable and gave a  no-objection to the introduction of Covered Sale Buy Back Bonds (CSBBB). The BoU approved the marketability of the Deposit Auction Facility as well as its issuance at a discount. As a result, the financial institutions can now ably trade the Deposit Auction facility in the secondary market.  Stakeholder impact is critical for the long-term survival of Supervised Financial Institutions (SFIs). SFIs ought to proactively assess the power and influence of each of their stakeholders as well as the legitimacy of stakeholder claims on financial institutions and design effective strategies to respond to each of the stakeholder claims. Specifically, the power and influence exhibited by the general public and depositors places them as key players in the management of financial institution’s liquidity. 
 6 Therefore, unnecessary “noise” perceived by depositors relating to the uncertainty of the long term survival of a financial institution can spark off liquidity crises and bank runs. Financial institutions must therefore invest appropriately in developing effective corporate communication strategies as a new liquidity management tool.   Last but not least, I would like to congratulate Mr. Matthias Katamba on his appointment as the new Managing Director of dfcu Bank. But also thank Mr. Juma Kisaame for serving dfcu Bank diligently.  Mr. Michael Mugabi,  allow me to congratulate you in your new assignment as Acting Managing Director of Housing Finance Bank.  And I hope that the Board of Directors shall find it fitting to confirm you in that position.  Once again, I thank you for the continued support to the economic development of Uganda through your financial intermediation role.   Thank you for listening.

Carolyn Wilkins: Launch of the new exhibition “A NoteworthyWoman”Remarks by Ms Carolyn A Wilkins, Senior Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada, at theLaunch of the new exhibition "A Noteworthy Woman", Bank of Canada Museum, Ottawa, Ontario,29 November 2018.*   *   *Thank you all for being here for the opening of A Noteworthy Woman, our temporary exhibitionabout the imagery on Canada’s new $10 bank note. The process to choose the first Canadianwoman to be featured on a regular bank note was exciting, and it inspired many. We receivedmore than 26,000 submissions.This exhibition retraces our journey with Canadians to collect ideas. It tells the story of the 12amazing women who, in the end, were considered for the honour, and of Viola Desmond and herlasting legacy as a human rights icon in Canada.The artifacts in the exhibit are evocative reminders of Viola Desmond’s life and the time in whichshe lived. The focus has, of course, been on that day in a movie theatre in Nova Scotia in 1946. Asuccessful business woman was denied a seat downstairs, was arrested and jailed, thenultimately convicted and fined for doing what was right in a system that was wrong.Yet, that day in the theatre was not the first time Viola Desmond had experienced systemicracism. She had always dreamed of opening her own beauty salon, but the 1930s was not a timewhen a woman—and especially a black woman—could easily succeed. Nova Scotia beautyschools would not accept her, so Viola trained in Montréal and the United States. She thenreturned to Halifax to open her own studio in 1937, during the depths of the Great Depression.Viola Desmond had been an inspiration for years before she bought that fateful movie ticket.Our exhibition includes mementos from Viola Desmond’s business and seats from the movietheatre where her public battle began.More poignant still is Viola Desmond’s free pardon, granted in 2010 by the government of NovaScotia, which recognized that she was innocent of the conviction that had remained on herrecord for 63 years. She never got to see justice served. It is a pleasure and honour to haveWanda Robson here today to share this moment dedicated to her sister.The exhibition also highlights other design features of the vertical $10 note, which centre on thetheme of human rights and social justice. You will find an image of an eagle feather, an excerptfrom the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and an image of the Canadian Museum for HumanRights, where Wanda Robson spent the first new $10 note 10 days ago.We could not leave out of the exhibition the important stories of the 11 inspirational women whowere also considered for the bank note. These remarkable women overcame barriers, createdsignificant change and left Canada better because of their contributions.Soon, many Canadians will carry a Viola Desmond note in their wallets. But the lessons of herlife must continue to be told. That’s why I’m glad that, through this exhibition, people will be ableto learn more about her history, and Canada’s history. It is by interpreting our past that we informour future.I hope you’ll spend some time touring the exhibition, and the rest of the wonderful museum wehave here. Many Canadian stories are among the displays.With that, I’d like to thank Ken Ross and the entire Museum team for their hard work in bringing 1 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
this exhibition together, and to introduce the Honourable Maryam Monsef, Minister of Status ofWomen. The partnership between the Government of Canada and the Bank in designing a newbank note has brought us to this historic moment. We are grateful the minister could be heretoday. 2 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
SPEECH  Side 1 af 6 SPEECH BY GOVERNOR LARS ROHDE  AT THE ANNUAL MEETING OF  FINANCE DENMARK 2018     CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY   Thank you for inviting me to speak here today. In an age when partnerships are discontinued, and walls are built be-tween countries, I find it important to focus on the considerable ad-vantages to our society and its continued development which rule-based international cooperation offers. I have chosen to talk about three topical issues which, in their separate ways, relate to cross-border cooperation and which are essential to fi-nancial stability in Denmark. They are: anti-money laundering, crisis reso-lution of mortgage credit institutions and the banking union.    But first I would like to express my appreciation of the good cooperation we have had in many areas. You contributed strongly to the process of connecting the Danish krone to TARGET2-Securities. It is a great step forward that Danish banks are now able to settle securities via the single European settlement platform.  Many of you have also helped to launch Kronos2, and we have jointly achieved significant results in the Payments Council. In the FSOR, we have increased the cyber resilience of the financial sector, and we have agreed to perform sophisticated tests of the resilience of the individual institu-tions in the coming years – known as the red team tests. ----- Unfortunately, money laundering has been on everyone's lips in 2018. A simple search in Infomedia shows that the Danish word "hvidvask" has been used four times as frequently this year as in 2017.      3 December 2018 
  Page 2 of 6 We have witnessed extensive misuse of the financial infrastructure for il-legal activities. There has been and still is a need to strengthen efforts in this area.  At Danmarks Nationalbank we are interested in this issue because money laundering can jeopardise financial stability. Customer and investor con-fidence is an essential prerequisite for providing financial services. So, loss of confidence can be very harmful for a bank. If confidence in a single participant is eroded, this may rapidly have an impact on the rest of the sector.  The reputation of the authorities and the country may also be severely affected. This became very clear to me at the IMF Annual Meeting in Oc-tober when I received many enquiries about the money laundering chal-lenge in the Danish financial sector.  Banks play a key role in the financial infrastructure. And with this role comes an important social responsibility. A responsibility for ensuring that their businesses are not used for illegal activities.  The number of suspicious transactions reported to the anti-money laun-dering secretariat has soared in recent years. If this continues, the au-thorities will face a huge task in relation to handling the volume of re-ports.  There are indications that the lines of defence are too far back. They should be reached long before reporting becomes necessary. In other words, the banks should have knowledge of their customers.  As payment systems have become faster and more efficient, it is of para-mount importance that the banks have in-depth knowledge of their cus-tomers.  It is the role of the authorities to investigate cases of money laundering if there is suspicion of illegal activities. But before it comes to that, the banks have a responsibility not to engage in customer relationships if the real motives of the customers are dubious.  The political agreement to strengthen anti-money laundering efforts in Denmark that was concluded in the autumn was necessary. But money laundering knows no borders. Cross-border activities call for strength-ened cross-border supervision in the EU.  So, it is essential also to enhance European cooperation. That will pro-vide a far better overview of the activities of international banking groups. And it will also enable the build-up of stronger competences in this area.  
  Page 3 of 6  ----- Now I will turn my attention to another topic. Something that I have talked about previously. Resolution of mortgage credit institutions. My interest in this topic is not purely academic. I myself witnessed the near-death of a mortgage credit institution in the 90s, and I know that others who are present today shared that experience. It made an impression on me – and presumably also on you.  So, I would like to reiterate: one of the key lessons learned from the fi-nancial crisis was that it must be possible to manage crises in the financial sector without the use of government funds. It must be possible for the large, systemically important institutions to continue in case they experience problems. They perform functions that are critical to society and essential to financial stability.  How do we ensure this? Well, one of the preconditions is that there are sufficient owner and creditor funds that can absorb losses, also known as eligible liabilities and own funds.  As you know, Danish mortgage credit institutions have been exempted from the minimum requirement for eligible liabilities and own funds, MREL. Instead, they must meet a debt buffer requirement. In Danmarks Nationalbank's opinion, that is a bad idea. And we still think so, even though things have changed since I last addressed you: Since then, a legislative amendment has been introduced for SIFIs that include mortgage credit institutions. For them, the sum of the MREL and capital and debt buffer requirements must constitute at least 8 per cent of total liabilities and own funds.  The amendment is a step in the right direction. However, it does not solve the problem; there are still SIFIs for which the requirements are not sufficiently high for the institutions to be recapitalised and continued in a crisis situation. Furthermore, the problem with the current requirement for mortgage credit institutions is that it is not risk-sensitive.  The MREL is. It increases when risks increase, as they typically do in bad times. That is why we need an MREL for mortgage credit institutions.  And here is the good news. At Danmarks Nationalbank we have calculat-ed the costs of introducing an MREL for mortgage credit institutions now that we have the 8 per cent requirement. And the costs are negligible.  
  Page 4 of 6 Our calculations show that the sector's total costs will be in the range of kr. 100 to 200 million.  The institutions can finance this by reducing costs or dividend payments. If they choose to raise their administration margins instead, we have cal-culated that the cost is equivalent to an average increase of less than 1 basis point in administration margins.  Surely that is a low price to pay for ensuring that mortgage credit institu-tions can be resolved without jeopardising financial stability and taxpayer funds? As I see it, this is the right thing to do. I would like to wake up in the morning, drink a cup of coffee and know that we make the right choices for society.  Doing away with the exemption will also give the authorities the option of using the Resolution Fund if required.   My final message regarding resolution is this: a precondition for credible resolution is that financial institutions can be handled without any knock-on effect on the sector overall.   I would like to make it clear that for Danmarks Nationalbank it is of the essence that mortgage bonds do not suffer losses. Fortunately, the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive – BRRD – provides a solution: it is pos-sible to exclude certain liabilities and own funds from being written down or converted. That should be the case for mortgage bonds. Instead, there must be sufficient eligible liabilities and own funds.  That is why we should have an MREL for mortgage credit institutions. ----- Anti-money laundering and crisis resolution rules – the two topics I have talked about so far – are examples of areas where binding international cooperation offers clear advantages.  The government envisages that next autumn a final decision will be made on Danish participation in the banking union.  What would it mean in terms of anti-money laundering and resolution of failing banks and mortgage credit institutions if Denmark joins the bank-ing union, we might ask.    
  Page 5 of 6 About anti-money laundering, supervision will still be a matter for the na-tional authorities.   When it comes to crisis resolution, the single insurance element of the banking union is important, but the probability that it will be invoked is very low.  However, there are a number of other good reasons why Denmark should join the banking union.  The union has not been established for the sake of the banks but to serve the interests of citizens, firms and financial stability. And it is a further de-velopment of the single market for financial services, which strengthens competition.  For some banks, this increased competition may not be an advantage. But for citizens and firms it is a clear advantage.  The ECB's Single Supervisory Mechanism, SSM, has now existed for four years and has proved to be a strong and capable supervisory authority.  The SSM can bring together strong skills and analytical powers. This is necessary for effective supervision of the largest banks, which are com-plex, operate across borders and use sophisticated models.  The SSM does not necessarily give the banks more latitude. But it under-pins financial stability. In this context, the parallel to anti-money launder-ing is also relevant. The cases we have seen illustrate that international activity requires a response in the form of close and binding international collaboration between authorities.  The greatest change if Denmark joins the banking union will be that Dan-ish banks will be subject to the SSM supervisory practices. The impact will be most direct for the large banks, which will be supervised by the ECB via instructions to the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority. The smaller banks will still be supervised by the Danish Financial Supervisory Authori-ty within a framework defined by the ECB. Participation in the banking union will give Denmark a say in relation to the single supervisory practice via participation in the ECB's Supervisory Board. And via the ECB we will have a voice and influence in the Basel Committee and the Financial Stability Board, which are key bodies in the design of financial regulation.  
  Page 6 of 6 Those who are against Danish participation in the banking union often argue that Danish taxpayers and bank customers risk footing the bill if banks in e.g. Greece or Italy fail.  At Danmarks Nationalbank we have studied this aspect closely. The heart of the matter is the joint liability of banking union participants and the likelihood that it will be invoked.  Our reply is that the structure of the banking union means that joint liabil-ity will apply only in very extreme loss scenarios. The joint liability is a kind of insurance against disaster, it will not result in regular flows of funds between banking union member states. We are not the only ones who are concerned about ending up with bills that others ought to pay. The very structure of the banking union and the practice that has characterised the euro area member states' handling of the euro debt crisis reflect precisely these concerns.  Very large and very influential euro area players share our views and will ensure that we do not move too far in the wrong direction. Reluctance to transfer funds between member states has been seen in connection with the crises resolved within the banking union until now. Most recently, we have seen that Italy has provided government support – but without the use of funds from other member states.  The joint liability which is already part of the banking union in the form of the Single Resolution Fund, SRF, being built up also contains protective elements. This means that a loss scenario must reach a very late stage before the SRF can be activated. And finally, it has also been established that a single deposit insurance scheme will apply in connection with extremely large losses only. Irre-spective of how this single deposit insurance scheme is designed. This does not mean that the single insurance elements do not matter. But it means that they should not be conclusive arguments for or against Danish participation in the banking union. Let me sum up what I have said by emphasising that rule-based interna-tional cooperation is the best solution to cross-border challenges. Not least for a small country like Denmark. Thank you.  
BANKOFGHANAEST.1957     LAUNCH OF THE CYBER SECURITY DIRECTIVE FOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS   A SAFER DIGITAL FINANCIAL INDUSTRY       SPEECH BY  DR. MAXWELL OPOKU-AFARI,  FIRST DEPUTY GOVERNOR, BANK OF GHANA        BANK OF GHANA HEAD OFFICE, ACCRA  OCTOBER 22, 2018 
 1  Honorable Minister of Communications, Mrs. Ursula Owusu-Ekuful, Second Deputy Governor, Bank of Ghana, Members of the Board, Bank of Ghana, Heads of Banks, Members of the Ghana Association of Bankers,  Members of the Ghana Association of Savings and Loans,  Members of the Ghana Association of Microfinance Institutions, Members of the Chartered Institute of Bankers, Staff of Bank of Ghana, Distinguished Members of the Press, Ladies and Gentlemen, all protocols observed.   
 2  1. Good afternoon Ladies and Gentlemen. It is a pleasure to welcome all of you to the Bank of Ghana and I deem it a great honour for having such august audience joining us for this special occasion.  As we are all aware, today marks another significant milestone in the history of Ghana’s financial sector as we launch the Cyber Security Directives for Financial Institutions.   2. After careful consideration on issues regarding cyber security and its implications on financial intermediation, the Bank chose the theme “A Safer Digital Financial Industry” to launch the Cyber Security Directives for two main reasons. First, we envisage that this theme will shape the strategic direction in terms of cyber security of the banking industry and to the larger extent, the entire financial sector. And secondly, it signals the collective efforts of stakeholders to address the 
 3  canker of cyber threat and all other actions that exploit vulnerabilities of the financial systems and processes.  3. Currently, technology is intertwined with our everyday lives. It is re-defining business processes, promoting greater interconnectedness between countries and peoples, enhancing skill development and innovation, and more broadly, breaking down perceived barriers in every sector.  In the banking sector, for instance, technology has taken a center stage in the financial intermediation process. Recently, key developments within the intermediation process include the growing importance of FinTechs in delivering financial services as well as the introduction of electronic payment platforms to enhance interoperability. In effect, the continuous role played by technology has had considerable impact on the operations of financial institutions and 
 4  ultimately driven policies aimed at promoting financial inclusiveness for growth and poverty reduction.   4. In all of these developments, financial services remains critical and the Bank of Ghana has established, as a major policy priority, the development of a sound financial system with strong individual component institutions. The idea is to position the sector as a major growth driver, to support an inclusive broad-based economy with the full implementation of new higher minimum capital requirements by the end of this year. We know that banks are working strenuously to meet this requirement which would help establish a banking industry that is well capitalized to support the much needed economic transformation Ghana needs.  
 5  5. As the Bank of Ghana pursues this objective, alongside strengthening the regulatory and supervisory environment to restore confidence and promote stability and integrity of the banking sector, it is important that we also take concrete steps towards implementing cyber security measures to combat financial crime. Through the Bank’s monitoring systems, we have observed the daily attempts by cyber criminals to bypass security controls and exploit vulnerabilities within the cyber and information security defenses of financial systems. We cannot ignore the fact that the increasing use of technology with its attendant interconnectedness has enabled some of these challenges.   6. Globally, risks associated with cybercrime on financial systems have increased, notable among them are the financial disruptions arising from cyber-incidents in Bangladesh and 
 6  Malaysia. Indeed, cyber-attacks have the potential to pose systemic risk by disrupting business operations within the financial sector. For Ghana, the threat is growing. A recent study in 2016 disclosed that there were more than 400,000 Malware incidents, 44 million Spam incidents, and 280,000 Bot incidents within Ghana’s financial industry.  7. With this background and the complexities associated with the advancement of technology, it is imperative that the Bank of Ghana takes steps to counter these threats to ensure the integrity and operational security of the financial system. It is in this regard that the Bank of Ghana has developed the Cyber Security Directive for Financial Institutions. The objectives of this Directive are to ensure an uninterrupted financial intermediation process through a robust and resilient 
 7  financial sector and also to boost the trust and confidence of consumers in the banking industry.  8. Ladies and Gentlemen, we will all agree that the resilience of the financial sector is largely dependent on the soundness of financial institutions and the robustness of the financial market infrastructure. The Cyber Security Directive for Financial Institutions does not fall short of addressing these objectives. Among others, the Directive seeks to establish the conduct and operational guidelines for the cyber and information security environment. Specifically, it sets out procedures for governance, risk management, internal audit, asset management, cyber defense, and cyber response, among others.  
 8  9. All of us in the industry have key roles to play in the implementation of this Directive. One unique characteristic of this directive is the required active involvement of senior management executives and boards of financial institutions. All banks are to appoint a Cyber and Information Security Officer (CISO) who would advise senior management and the board on cyber security issues, and also formulate adequate measures to manage cyber and information security risks.   10. A key component of the measures to be deployed by the CISO is the training and education of all stakeholders. Colleagues, it takes an individual to click on an email attachment for a virus to be introduced into the system of an organization, but the whole organization and sometimes the entire nation may also suffer the unintended consequences of this singular action. Therefore, another crucial element of the 
 9  Directive is the creation of an enabling framework for the efficient information sharing among stakeholders, for example between financial institutions and regulators, and among financial institutions as well.  11. In line with the National Cyber Security Awareness Month (NCSA) therefore, the Bank of Ghana is today, launching the Cyber and Information Security Directive for the financial industry. Subsequent to this launch, banks would be required to follow an implementation schedule to ensure that effective cyber security controls are in place to counter any threats of cybercrime.   12. Ladies and Gentlemen, as I conclude this speech, I would like to reiterate the need for collaboration among key stakeholders in the fight against cyber-crime. We need not 
 10  only implement these Directives, but also collaborate with each other in the industry to overcome the threats of cybercrime. As bankers, we must incorporate cyber security in our daily activities and imbibe these Directives in the policies and procedures of our individual financial institutions. Cyber threat is continuously evolving, and as custodians of the financial sector, let us all embrace the Cyber Security Directive and work assiduously to ensure its success.  13.

Yi Gang: Deepen reform and opening-up comprehensively. Createnew prospects for financial sectorSpeech by Mr Yi Gang, Governor of the People's Bank of China, to commemorate the 40thanniversary of China's economic reform and the 70th anniversary of the People's Bank of China(PBC), Beijing, 17 December 2018.*   *   *This year marks the 40th anniversary of the reform and opening-up and the 70th anniversary ofthe founding of the People’s Bank of China (PBC). As components of China’s tremendousachievements in the progress of the reform and opening-up,  historic changes in the financialsector have taken place in the past four decades, and a modern financial market system hasbeen broadly established which, adapting to the socialist market economy with Chinesecharacteristics, is vital and internationally competitive. And over the past 70 years, under theleadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC), the PBC has made extensive explorationand innovation, overcome formidable obstacles, pioneered in the promotion of financialdevelopment, reform and opening-up at different times, kept creating new prospects for thefinancial sector, and made significant contributions to China’s economic and social development.Financial Adjustment and Macro Prudential Management Framework Gradually ImprovedThe monetary policy framework has been established and improved. After the founding of newChina, the country adopted a mono-bank system compatible with the planned economy,wherein the PBC functioned as a central bank and a unique commercial bank as well. Followingthe introduction of the reform and opening-up policy, the PBC gradually split off its industrial andcommercial credit and savings businesses, and exclusively performed the functions of a centralbank since 1983, with primary responsibility lying in the implementation of macro financialpolicies. Amid the steady progress in reform and opening-up and the transition from the plannedeconomy to the socialist market economy with Chinese characteristics, the monetary policyregulatory mechanism was gradually shifted from direct adjustment-oriented to indirectadjustment-oriented. First, the Law of the PRC on the People’s Bank of China specified thatthe ultimate objective of monetary policy is “to maintain the stability of the value of the currencyand thereby promote economic growth”. Second, measures were taken to reform the credit planmanagement system which featured “centralized management on deposits and loans”, eliminatecaps on credit scales, gradually establish the M2 money supply as the intermediate target ofmonetary policy, and develop in due time indicator of aggregate financing to the real economy(AFRE) as an important source of reference for monetary policy. Third, the monetary policyinstruments including required reserve, central bank lending, central bank discount and openmarket operation have been created and improved. In order to meet the actual demands ofeconomic and financial development, monetary policy tools such as open market short-termliquidity adjustment instruments have been launched in succession.Monetary policy macro adjustment has been strengthened. At different stages of economicdevelopment, the PBC has always made timely and proper adjustments in monetarypolicies according to the changes in financial and economic landscape. Here are severalexamples. In the late 1980s, China experienced serious economic overheating and inflation.Under the leadership of the central government, the PBC strengthened control over the totalsupply of money and credit, stepped up efforts to rectify financial governance, and managed toeffectively curb fast growing investment and soaring prices in a relatively short time. Followingthe year of 2003, China’s economy entered another upward cycle and the next five years saw 15rises in required reserve ratio. In 2007 alone, the required reserve ratio was increased on tenoccasions, and the benchmark interest rates for deposits and loans were raised six times. In2008, the US sub-prime mortgage crisis spread worldwide and escalated into a global financialcrisis, significant changes took place in the economic and financial landscapes at home and 1 / 11BIS central bankers' speeches
abroad. The PBC resolutely implemented the decisions of the CPC Central Committee and thecounter-crisis package plan developed by the State Council, made timely adjustments to thedirection, priority and intensity of monetary policy, reduced the benchmark interest rates fordeposits and loans five times and the required reserve ratio four times so as to ensure anadequate supply of liquidity and eventually make China’s economy among the first in the worldstabilize and rebound in 2009. Then in the second quarter of 2009, following the solid recovery ofChina’s economy, the PBC made prompt reverse adjustments by increasing required reserveratio three times, hence effectively undermining the influence of policy overshooting. After 2015,and especially since the beginning of 2018, faced with the cyclical downward pressure emergingin economic structural adjustment, the PBC has remained steadfast in pursuing its policy,conducted pre-adjustment and fine-tuning at appropriate junctures, proactively enhanced itssupport for the supply-side structural reform and high-quality economic development, especiallyfor private enterprises and small and micro enterprises, and alleviated the downward pressureon the real economy.The two-pillar regulatory framework of monetary policy and macro prudential policy has beenestablished. After the outbreak of the global financial crisis in 2008, the international communityrecognized that macro imprudence was a crucial cause of the crisis. The PBC spearheaded inthe innovative exploration of counter-cyclical macro prudential management. In the second half of2009, as RMB loans grew rapidly, it proposed to develop new counter-cyclical measuresunder the macro prudential policy framework. In 2010, the PBC explored the practice of macroprudential management by introducing dynamic adjustments of differentiated reserverequirements, associating credit expansion with capital adequacy level required by the macroprudential management. At end-2010, the Central Economic WorkConference explicitly instructed to use well of the macro prudential tool. After that, the PBCcontinuously improved macro prudential policies, upgraded the dynamic adjustmentmechanism for differentiated reserve requirements into the Macro Prudential Assessment(MPA) system, and took gradual steps to include more financial activities, asset expandingbehaviors, and all-system cross-border financing in its macro prudential management. In 2017,“improving the framework of regulation underpinned by monetary policy and macro-prudentialpolicy” was formally written in the report of the 19th CPC National Congress.Battle for forestalling and defusing major risks has progressed. In the report to the 19th CPCNational Congress, General Secretary Xi Jinping noted that we must fight three critical battlesand the first of which is to take tough steps to forestall and defuse major risks. The PBC hasproactively fulfilled the responsibilities of the General Office of the Financial Stability andDevelopment Committee under the State Council, taken the lead in developing the three-yearaction plan to forestall and defuse major risks, launched new asset management regulations andsupporting policies, strengthened regulation of financial holding groups, improved regulatoryregimes for systematically important financial institutions (SIFIs) and financial infrastructures,and shored up weak links in the system. Measures have been taken to promote structuraldeleveraging in an active and prudent manner, properly manage money supply, tighten asset anddebt constraints for state-owned enterprises, rigorously implement differentiated housing creditpolicies, and strictly curb the excessive growth of household debt as well as local governments’hidden debt and leverage ratio. Meanwhile, the PBC has also rectified various financial chaos in awell-regulated way, resolutely resolved risks of some high-risk financial holding groups,intensively rectified the financial order and conducted the special program on addressing Internetfinancial risks.Financial Institutional Reform Continuously DeepenedRemarkable achievements have been made in the reform of large state-owned commercialbanks. In 1979, in order to support “loans for government grants” reform, the central governmentestablished various state-owned specialized banks, gradually discarded the division of workamong these banks, split off their policy-related businesses, and transformed them into market 2 / 11BIS central bankers' speeches
competitors. However, due to deficiencies in financial standards and rules, imperfect corporategovernance structure and inadequate capital, as well as the impact of the 1997 Asian financialcrisis, there was a massive build-up of non-performing loans in the banking sector. At that time,some scholars at home and abroad believed China’s large state-owned commercial banks wereon the brink of “technical bankruptcy”. In response, the Chinese government issued specialtreasury bonds and established four asset management companies that specialized in receivingand disposing non-performing loans of RMB 1.4 trillion hived off from state-owned commercialbanks. However, deeper reforms like the institutional reform of large state-owned commercialbanks remained untouched.In February 2002, it was clarified at the Second National Financial Work Conference that largestate-owned commercial banks should be transformed into joint-stock companies and those withappropriate conditions could get listed. In 2003, the central government decided that the PBCshould take the lead in researches on the reform of large state-owned commercial banks. ThePBC then proposed creatively to inject the state’s foreign exchange (FX) reserves into largecommercial banks, and designed a four-step reform program which included writing off actualcapital losses, splitting off and disposing of non-performing assets, injecting FX reserves andgetting listed on domestic or foreign markets. In September 2003, upon the deliberation andapproval of the CPC Central Committee, the State Council approved the general plan fortransforming large state-owned commercial banks into joint-stock banks, of which the draftingwas led by the PBC. According to the plan, Bank of Communications (BOCOM), ChinaConstruction Bank (CCB), Bank of China (BOC), Industrial and Commercial Bank ofChina (ICBC) and Agricultural Bank of China (ABC) successively underwent shareholdingreforms, stripped off non-performing assets, significantly shored up their capital base, andeventually went listed. During the process, they gradually established relatively well-regulatedcorporate governance structure and notably enhanced their internal management, risk controlcapability and market constraint mechanism, with their assets and profitability leaping into thefront ranking of the world. Since 2011, BOC, ICBC, ABC and CCB were successivelyincluded inthe list of global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). Past experience has demonstrated thatit was through reforms that we could achieve a leap forward in the soundness of large financialinstitutions and that China’s financial system was able to withstand the severe blow of the 2008global financial crisis.Continued advances have been made in the reform of rural credit cooperatives. In 1996, ruralcredit cooperatives were decoupled from the ABC and administered by the PBC. After 1998, theState Council set up first the rectification group and then the reform & research group, in a bid toregulate and consolidate rural credit cooperatives. Though the move enhanced their strength,the rural credit cooperatives still faced such problems as unclear property relationship,inadequacy in management systems, heavy historical burdens and poor asset quality. By theend of 2002, the non-performing loan ratio of rural credit cooperatives in China was as high asaround 50%, and 97.8% of rural credit cooperatives were insolvent. After the Second NationalFinancial Work Conference held in 2002, the State Council established the task force, which wasled by the PBC, for deepening reforms of rural finance and rural credit cooperatives. And theoverall requirements for reform and development of rural credit cooperatives including “propertyrelationship to be clarified, constraint mechanisms to be strengthened, services to be improved,appropriate support to be provided by the state and local governments to be heldresponsible” were specified. In June 2003, the reform of rural credit cooperatives was pilotedin Zhejiang and seven other provinces and then applied nationwide in a phased manner. Byissuing special central bank bills and special central bank lending, the PBC managed to helprural credit cooperatives in pilot areas to reduce historical burdens. Meanwhile, in formulating therequirements for the issuance and redemption of special lending and special bills as well as theevaluation procedure, the PBC closely integrated financial support into the process of rural creditcooperative reform, so as to gradually bring them “to a new stage”. Under the positivemechanism of constraints and incentives, the asset quality, profitability, funding to supportagriculture and business sustainability of rural credit cooperatives have been significantly 3 / 11BIS central bankers' speeches
improved.The reform of development-oriented and policy-backed financial institutions has been proceedingin an orderly manner. To tackle the problems of the indistinction between  policy-orientedbusinesses and commercial businesses in state-owned commercial banks and their severemoral hazards, the Chinese government established three policy banks, namely ChinaDevelopment Bank (CDB), Export-Import Bank of China (CEXIM) and Agricultural DevelopmentBank of China (ADBC) in 1994. They grew over the decade but were, to varying degrees,troubled by problems like ambiguous boundaries of business and imperfectgovernance structure. According to the reform principles of targeted guidance and “one policy forone bank” specified on the National Financial Work Conference in 2007, the PBC worked withrelevant authorities to first commercialize the CDB, replenishing its capital base and building up asound corporate governance structure. Since the outbreak of the international financial crisis in2008, it has clearly proved that letting development-oriented and policy-backed financialinstitutions serve national strategies is crucial and necessary. By injecting FX reserves andspecifying bond credit policies, the PBC provided funding support for the reform of development-oriented and policy-backed financial institutions to improve their capital adequacy, and formulatedcharters of CDB, CEXIM and ADBC to facilitate improvements to their corporategovernance structure and risk prevention and control system. Through a series of reforms, thePBC further enhanced the policy-related functions of CEXIM and ADBC, clarified CDB’s positionas a development-oriented financial institution, significantly strengthened the capital baseand resilience of the three institutions, and remarkably improved their governance structure andconstraint mechanism.Reforms of Market-based Interest Rate and Exchange Rate Steadily PromotedMarket-based interest rate reform has made significant breakthroughs. Back in 1993, the ThirdPlenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee proposed that “the central bank shouldmake timely adjustment of benchmark interest rates based on market supply and demand whileallowing deposit rates of commercial banks to fluctuate within limits”. Since then, the conditionsfor marketizing interest rate became mature with the successive implementation of the Law ofthe PRC on the People’s Bank of China and the Law of the PRC on Commercial Banks. On June1, 1996, the PBC officially eased restrictions on interbank offered rate, marking an important steptowards market-based interest rate. Later, the PBC steadily promoted market-based interest ratereform under the principle of “domestic currency after foreign currency, deposits after loans,short-term after long-term”, and gradually realized market-based interest rates in the bondmarket and in the deposits and loans of foreign currencies. China eased most of the interest raterestrictions by gradually expanding the floating range of deposit and loan rates after the globalfinancial crisis in 2008, by completely removing restrictions on loan rates of financial institutionsin July, 2013 and by lifting the cap of deposit rates in October, 2015, all of which markedsignificant breakthroughs in China’s market-based interest rate reform.Market-based exchange rate reform has been steadily advanced. Since the reform and openingup, China started to facilitate foreign trade system reform by implementing foreign exchangeretention system, establishing foreign exchange swap market afterwards, and easing restrictionson individual use of foreign exchange, which led to the coexistence of official exchange rate andmarket-based exchange rate. On January 1, 1994, the reform of RMB exchange rate regimeachieved a breakthrough in the unifying of official exchange rate and that in the foreign exchangeswap market, resulting in a single, managed floating exchange rate regime based on marketdemand and supply, and a tiered and unified foreign exchange market. On July 21, 2005, thePBC relaunched the reform of RMB exchange rate regime, with a managed floating exchangerate regime based on market demand and supply with reference to a basket of currencies. Withthree successive adjustments in 2007, 2012 and 2014, the daily trading band for the USD/CNYhas been widened from 3‰ to 2%, indicating that the PBC has basically withdrawn from regularintervention of the exchange market and that the flexibility of RMB exchange rate has been 4 / 11BIS central bankers' speeches
significantly enhanced. In the past decade, especially after the exchange rate reform initiated onAugust 11, 2015, RMB exchange rate formation mechanism has become increasingly market-based. By now, the flexibility of the two-way floating of the RMB exchange rate has beenenhanced significantly, with a steady exchange rate expectation. RMB exchange rate remainedbasically stable at a reasonable and balanced level.Financial Market System Established and ImprovedThe bond market has achieved leapfrog development. During the period of resuming governmentbond issuance in 1981 to establishing China Central Depository & Clearing Co., Ltd in 1996,China’s bond market undergone twists and turns featuring seven years of “bond supplied withoutdemand”, and the closing of treasury futures market due to the “3.27 incident” after two-yearoperation from 1993. After the First National Financial Work Conference in 1997, all commercialbanks withdrew from the exchange bond market and started to conduct bond repurchase andspot trading in the interbank market. This marked the beginning of a diversified and tiered bondmarket system which includes exchange market and the over-the-counter (OTC) retail market(commercial bank OTC market) and was mainly dominated by OTC block trading market(interbank bond market). Since 2000, under the basic approach of “easing administrativeregulations, serving for qualified institutional investors and relying on OTC market”, the PBC hasbeen actively promoting the development of reforming the bond market’s role and structure. Ithas propelled the establishment and improvement of the systems such as market maker rule,settlement agent system, currency broker system, information disclosure system, and creditrating system. It has improved systems for bond issuing, exchange, trust and clearing,established Shanghai Clearing House, facilitated the establishment of National Association ofFinancial Market Institutional Investors and China Bond Insurance Co., Ltd. To accelerateinnovation of financial products, the PBC launched subordinated bonds, ordinary financial bonds,short-term financing bills and medium-term notes. Besides spot exchange and bond repurchase,the PBC also offers bond lending, bond forward and credit risk mitigation (CRM) instruments.The category of basic products is almost the same with developed bond markets. At the end ofOctober, 2018, China ranked as the world’s third largest bond market behind the United Statesand Japan, with outstanding bonds almost hitting RMB 84 trillion. Besides, China’s bond marketalso served the role of extending direct financing channels for the real economy, improving socialfinancing structure, enhancing transmission efficiency of monetary policies, lowering financingcosts, and strengthening financial stability. In October 2018, the PBC set up support instrumentof bond financing for private enterprises, which is to give credit support to private enterprises withtemporary difficulties via various market-oriented approaches such as the sale of CRMinstruments. And it has made positive progress.The coordinated development of the financial market has been advanced. The money markethas developed in an innovative way. Since interbank lending was approved among specializedbanks in China in 1984, interbank lending market emerged across China. In 1993, the PBCfostered the establishment of a national interbank lending market. In 2007, when the Measuresfor the Administration of Interbank Lending was issued, the PBC launched Shanghai InterbankOffered Rate (Shibor) and advanced the reform and opening of the money market. In addition,the bond repurchase market kept growing and the bill market developed in a well-regulatedmanner. China’s bill business started in the 1970s, while the Law of the PRC on NegotiableInstruments was released in the late 1990s. Since 2000, the PBC has been promoting the use ofelectronic commercial draft to facilitate the development of commercial acceptance bill. In 2016,the PBC pushed forward the establishment of a national bill transaction platform and ShanghaiCommercial Paper Exchange Corporate Ltd, which marked the expansion and functionenhancement of bill market. Moreover, the gold market has grown fully fledged in its functions.After gold jewelry market was opened in China in 1982, the PBC issued Regulations of the PRCon the Control of Gold and Silver. In 2002, the founding of Shanghai Gold Exchange (SGE)started the movement towards market-oriented gold market of China. By now, SGE has becomelargest exchange for physical gold bullion.  5 / 11BIS central bankers' speeches
RMB Internationalized on a Market-oriented BasisRMB internationalization is an inevitable trend and natural result of the deepening of reform andopening-up in China’s economic and financial sector. During the 2008 global financial crisis,RMB gained unexpected popularity among the international community. A number of countriesproactively set up currency swaps with China. Amid an increasing demand for RMB and China’sdeepening opening-up, the PBC built on the sound momentum generated to gradually make theRMB a fully convertible currency by further eliminating unnecessary administrative controls andpolicy restrictions and by constantly improving policy framework for cross-border use of RMB forthe real economy. In July 2009, the PBC launched the pilot program of RMB settlement in cross-border trade in several cities such as Shanghai and Guangdong. Later, the coverage of cross-border trade settlement in RMB was extended to the entire nation. After that, the PBC launchedvarious institutional arrangements, including RMB Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors(RQFII), RMB Qualified Domestic Institutional Investors (RQDII), Shanghai-Hong Kong Connect,Shenzhen-Hong Kong Connect, Mutual Recognition of Funds and Bond Connect, to improve theinfrastructure system for RMB internationalization. As China experienced greater economicgrowth and an elevating international status of RMB, a growing chorus of international voicesappeared, calling for RMB’s inclusion into the Special Drawing Rights (SDR) currency basket.Since the IMF reviews the SDR basket of currencies every five years, the 2015 Review offered ahistoric opportunity for RMB to be included into SDR basket. Under the strategic guidance of theCPC Central Committee, the PBC proactively fostered the inclusion process. On November 30,2015, the Executive Board of the IMF acknowledged RMB as a freely usable currency anddecided that it will be included in the SDR currency basket, effective October 1, 2016. It was animportant milestone in RMB internationalization, which reflected that the achievements of China’sreform and opening up were highly recognized by the international community.According to the SWIFT data, RMB ranked fifth worldwide as a global currency of payment at theend of August 2018, accounting for 2.12% of the global market. In Q2 of 2018, RMB reservesheld by countries that report to the IMF’s Currency Composition of Official Foreign ExchangeReserves (COFER) system stood at USD 193.38 billion. Over 60 foreign central banks andmonetary authorities have included RMB in their official FX reserves.Opening up of the Financial Sector Steadily ExpandedThe financial sector has been further opened up. In the early days of China’s reform and openingup, foreign banks were allowed to be established only in the Special Economic Zones (SEZs).They mainly offered services to three types of foreign-funded enterprises with creditfunds basically coming from overseas. After Deng Xiaoping’s Southern Inspection Tour Talks in1992, more openings were extended to foreign banks by removing geographical restrictions forsetting up institutions and by allowing foreign banks to conduct pilot operations of RMB businessin Shanghai. Since the accession to the WTO, China has been constantly expanding the openingof the financial sector in aspects of the establishment of financial institutions, the business scopeand foreign ownership. As a result, a number of foreign financial institutions set up operations inChina, which formed a financial service network with certain coverage and market depth. Foreignstrategic investors were also invited to participate in the transformation of large state-ownedcommercial banks into joint-stock companies. Since 2018, the PBC has resolutely implementedmajor state policies announced by General Secretary Xi Jinping at the Boao Forum for AsiaAnnual Conference to further reform and open up the financial sector, for which the PBCformulated relevant measures and timetable. In April, the PBC announced eleven reform andopening-up measures, seven of which have been implemented up to present. Meanwhile, thePBC is also promoting reform and opening up of the financial sector in areas such as paymentand clearing, bond market, credit-rating and credit reference.New achievements have been scored in international policy coordination and cooperation. In linewith China’s overall diplomatic strategy, the PBC carried out financial exchanges and 6 / 11BIS central bankers' speeches
cooperation in an all-round, multi-tiered, flexible and pragmatic manner. Firstly, the PBC hasactively participated in global economic governance and policy coordination, which includefulfilling the tasks of the G20 Finance Track especially those of 2016 G20 Hangzhou Summit;taking an active role and promoting the IMF Quota, Governance and Surveillance Reform, withChina’s IMF quota ranking third in the world and Chinese staff appointed to management posts ofthe IMF; and working with Financial Stability Board (FSB) and Basel Committee on BankingSupervision (BCBS) to develop standards and rules and promote alignment of domesticstandards with international standards. Secondly, the PBC has strengthened cooperation andinnovation in the multilateral development sector by joining, since 1980, various regional and sub-regional multilateral development banks such as the African Development Bank, Inter-AmericanDevelopment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Thirdly, thePBC took deep participation in the investment and financing cooperation under the Belt and RoadInitiative by encouraging financial institutions to conduct overseas fund business in RMB,promoting the establishment and expansion of the Silk Road Fund and advancing the networkbuilding of financial institutions and services. Fourthly, the PBC has strengthen regional financialcooperation through platforms such as ASEAN Plus Three Cooperation, the ShanghaiCooperation Organization and South East Asian Central Banks. Fifthly, the PBC has steadilyadvanced the development of RMB business in Hong Kong and Macao, consolidated HongKong’s position as an international financial center and established a cross-Straits currencyclearing mechanism.Major changes have been realized in foreign exchange administration. On December 1, 1996,China formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement. Sincethen the RMB had been fully convertible on current accounts. After that, China started to promoteRMB capital account convertibility. However, it was slowed down by the 1997 Asian financialcrisis and by severe economic and financial hardships. Since China’s accession to the WTO,the PBC has been steadily enhancing capital account convertibility through deepening reforms inline with the principle of “prioritizing inflow over outflow, long-term over short-term, direct overindirect, and institutions over individuals”. According to the IMF’s classification of capital account,37 out of all 40 items have already achieved full or partial convertibility, accounting for 92.5%,leaving only 3 items to be opened. Meanwhile, the PBC has accelerated the reform in foreignexchange administration, loosened its grip, streamlined administration and delegated power tosubstantially reduce exchange restrictions on cross-border capital and financial transactions,pursue balanced management of capital inflows and outflows and promote an equilibrium inbalance of payments.Foreign exchange reserve management has been constantly improved. Since the reform offoreign exchange management system in 1994, China has achieved a substantial increase inFX reserves. The PBC holds, manages and operates China’s FX reserves in accordance withthe law. Since 2001, FX reserves have been managed and operated following the principle of“safety, liquidity and asset value preservation and appreciation”, under the guidanceand supervision from all levels of the three-tiered approval system consisting of the StateCouncil, the PBC and the SAFE. By building a diversified portfolio, China has gradually expandedits FX reserves to cover more than 30 currencies, 50 types of asset products and 6,000investment targets with continuous operation 24 hours a day globally, and has constantlyimproved frameworks, approaches, instruments and means of risk management and internalcontrol. All this made it possible for China to withstand the challenges of financial crises such asthe Asian financial crisis, the US sub-prime mortgage crisis and the European sovereign debtcrisis and to achieve steady growth in the operation performance.Financial Infrastructure Continuously ReinforcedThe rule of law in financial sector has made solid headway. The institutional framework offinancial laws has been established with the fundamental laws including the Law of the PRC onthe People’s Bank of China, the Law of the PRC on Commercial Banks, the Securities Law, and 7 / 11BIS central bankers' speeches
the Insurance Law at the core and relevant administrative rules and regulations, departmentalrules and regulatory documents as important components. Laws and regulations have beenreleased such as the Anti-Money Laundering Law, the Administrative Rules for FinancialStatistics, the Regulation on the Administration of Credit Investigation Industry, and the DepositInsurance Regulation. The formulation and amendment of financial regulations including theRegulation on Non-depository Lending Organizations and the Interim Regulation on CashManagement have picked up pace. The reform to transform the government’s functions hasbeen continuously deepened. The online platform for administrative approval has been built up.We’ve further streamlined administration and delegated powers while improving the policytransparency.New breakthroughs have been made in financial statistics. A nationwide financial statisticsinformation system has been established to realize the concentration and sharing of financialstatistics. A series of indicators of aggregate financing to the real economy (AFRE) has beenformulated, specifying that the management targets for the aggregates of monetary policy areprovided by the asset-holding financial institutions. The indicators now serve as an importantreference for macro analysis and decision-making. A comprehensive financial statistics systemhas been formed while the asset management products have been innovatively incorporated inthe statistics. The macro-oriented specialized statistics and credit-policy statistics have beenstrengthened to serve financial regulation and prevent and control systemic financial risks.The construction of a modern payment and clearing system has been accelerated. Since thereform and opening-up, the payment and clearing system in China has achieved leap forwarddevelopment: from the reform of interbank system to the successive establishment of High ValuePayment System (HVPS), Bulk Electronic Payment System (BEPS), Cheque Image System(CIS) and Electronic Commercial Draft System (ECDS) as well as the launch of the SecondGeneration of China National Advanced Payment System (CNAPS), Accounting Data CentralizedSystem (ACS), and the RMB Cross-border Interbank Payment System (CIPS). China UnionPayhas been founded to facilitate the nationwide bankcard interoperability. The real-name system ofbank account has been in place with reform of classified management of personal bankaccounts completed. Guidance has been given to non-bank payment institutions for their healthydevelopment. Mobile payment in China has played the leading role in the world in terms ofbusiness volume, processing efficiency and coverage.The credit information system has gradually improved. In the second half of 1990s, the PBCstarted to build the credit information system of enterprises and individuals. Based on that, adatabase of financial credit information system has been built up and now plays a significant rolein improving the social credit system and preventing credit risks. Meanwhile, the conditionaleasing of market access leads to the growing overall competence and competitiveness ofmarket-based credit information institutions, which thus enables its development different fromand complementary with the national financial credit information system database. The PBC hasfully advanced the building of the social credit system and participated in establishing themechanism of collective punishment for deception and collective incentives for honesty.The service efficiency of currency and coins has continuously improved. Since its inception, thePBC has consecutively designed and printed five series of RMB banknotes. The printingtechniques and anti-counterfeit level of China’s banknote printing and minting have reached theworld’s advanced standards. The large-value cash management and services in terms of RMBnotes with small denominations have been improved with a constantly raising capacity and levelof cash management. The efforts to prevent and crack down counterfeiting banknotes have beenstepped up into the stage of systematic, scientific and refined management. The Digital CurrencyResearch Institute has been set up for in-depth digital currency R&D.The modern treasury system has been continuously improved. The PBC has performed itsfunction of managing the treasury since its foundation. With the release and implementation of 8 / 11BIS central bankers' speeches
the Regulation of the PRC on State Treasury and the Budget Law, the treasury management hasgrown towards law-based, scientific and regulated procedures. The constant advancement intreasury system and IT application has played a crucial role in safeguarding the security oftreasury and the execution of fiscal budgets at all levels. The launch of the Treasury InformationProcess System (TIPS) in 2006 in particular has provided solid safeguard for the fiscal fundsecurity and efficient operation.Efforts in the area of anti-money laundering (AML) have been continuously strengthened. In 2004,the State Council Inter-Ministerial Anti-Money Laundering Joint Meeting system was initiated, withthe PBC taking the lead, for better regulatory framework and strengthened coordination andcollaboration. The AML supervision has covered the full range of banking, securities and futures,insurance and key special non-financial sectors. China has been deeply engaged in theinternational exchanges, cooperation and policy-making of AML.The working mechanism for the protection of rights and interests of financial consumers hastaken initial shape. In 2012, the bureau for protecting the rights and interests of financialconsumers was set up to foster and reinforce the mechanism and measures, and to draft thepolicies, laws and regulations concerned. The PBC has organized various education activities forfinancial consumers while exploring to incorporate financial knowledge into the national educationsystem. Vigorous efforts have been devoted to financial inclusion, with China’s inclusive financialindicator system formed and improved and the coverage expansion of basic financial servicesprioritized.Intrinsic Logic and Experience Summing-up for the Reform and Development of China’sFinancial SectorSince the introduction of the reform and opening-up policy, Chinese financial reform anddevelopment has made tremendous and hard-earned achievements, whichhas undergone formidable and complex process, providing us with a rich legacy ofexperiences worthwhile to sum up.Letting the market play decisive role in resource allocation shall be upheld at all times. In the earlydays of reform and opening-up, the PBC was the sole bank in China bearing high monopolisticpower. After the reform was initiated, a large number of banks were established, includinghundreds of city commercial banks, thousands of rural commercial banks and rural creditcooperatives. As many of these banks completed shareholding reforms and went listed,their business efficiency was  greatly elevated with the property rights clarified and a markedreduction of state shareholding in the banking sector. Banks used to be the cashier of thegovernment and the state finance in the early days of reform and opening-up, whereas theyexercised independent operation after the reform and thereby became market entities inresource allocation. In line with the requirements of the Basel Committee on BankingSupervision, the banking sector has built up an asset-liability constraint mechanism with capitaladequacy ratio at its core, as well as a market-based loss absorbency and risk prevention andcontrol mechanism. At the beginning of the reform and opening-up, bank employees got thesame compensation regardless of their performance, whereas a market-based performanceevaluation system and a salary system that linked employees’ remunerations withtheir contributions were established after the reform. The deepened reform and opening-up hasfurther improved the accounting standard and information disclosure policy, and enhancedexternal supervision and market discipline. Now that the problems have been addressed inflawed financial institutions among securities companies, insurance companies and financialholding companies, the implicit repayment guarantees are in turn unwound and the exitmechanism is gradually built up. We are now steadily promoting the deposit insurance system,expecting the orderly building of a financial risk resolution framework based on deposit insurance.Law-based administration and fulfillment of duty shall be ensured at all times. It is a basic code 9 / 11BIS central bankers' speeches
that the functions of the PBC is designated by law and carried out in accordance with the law.Since the foundation of the Government Administration Council of the Central People’sGovernment in 1949, the PBC has been one of the Council’s composing institutions andprecisely practiced its functions in accordance with law. In 1982, the State Council furtheremphasized that “the People’s Bank of China is the central bank of the People’s Republic ofChina, and it is a government agency responsible for supervising the financial industry of thecountry under the leadership of the State Council”. In 1983, the State Council decided that thePBC should exclusively perform the function of the central bank and specified its ten functions. In1995, the Law of the PRC on the People’s Bank of China was enacted, which confirmed the law-granted status of the PBC as the central bank through state legislation. Revised in 2003, the Lawfurther stipulated that “as a composing department of the State Council, the People’s Bank ofChina is the central bank of the People’s Republic of China, and serves as a regulatorydepartment at macro level to formulate and implement monetary policies, maintain financialstability and provide financial services”.Firm actions shall be constantly taken to advance the opening-up of financial sector. It wasthrough opening-up and a thorough study of the international standard of financial supervisionand regulation, that we could have a realistic picture of how far we lagged behind, and webrought in better technology and management skills as well as competition mechanism. Themechanism especially contributes to improving corporate governance,reducing external administrative intervention, and promoting the reform of intermediary servicessuch as accounting standard, transparency, credit rating, etc. The opening-up has alsoadvanced the reforms in related fields at home. For instance, the inclusion of RMB in the SDRbasket required China, as a reserve currency issuer, constantly to improve its macro policyframework, so as to boost the world’s confidence in RMB.Safeguarding economic and financial stability shall be deemed as an important target at all times.A sound economic and financial environment is essential for the successful advancementof each financial reform. Therefore, flexible and appropriate accommodation of macro regulationand adjustments, especially monetary policy, should be pursued in line with the changingeconomic landscape, and counter-cyclical regulation should be enhanced as well. In times of anoverheated economy or asset bubbles, proper instruments should be used to achieve a“controllable pressure-relieving” and a “soft landing”, so as to secure a stable adjustment. Whenan economic recession or external economic shocks occur, timely measures should be taken tostabilize the financial market and enhance public confidence. Meanwhile, a healthy relationshipshould be maintained among financial reform, development and stability. The financial marketshall be developed with financial reform forging ahead and opening-up expanded, whilemaintaining the stability of the financial system and provision of continual financial services andholding the bottom line of preventing systemic financial risks.The role of a central bank shall be set from a forward-looking perspective. In order to better adaptto the changing environment and demands, the PBC’s role and its functions have been adjustedand refined many times since the reform and opening up. In a bid to fulfill new functions infinancial reform, development and financial stability, the PBC set up several specializeddepartments in 2003, including the bureaus of financial markets, financial stability, creditinformation system and anti-money laundering, after the three professional regulatory agencieswere established, namely, China Banking Regulatory Commission, China Securities RegulatoryCommission and China Insurance Regulatory Commission. In 2005, the PBC set up itsShanghai Head Office for better executing macro regulation and adjustment functions as thecentral bank and improving the decision-making and operation system. In 2009, a specializeddepartment was set up to push forward the reform of RMB exchange rate formation mechanismand cross-border use of RMB. In 2012, it established the specialized bureau of financialconsumer protection. In August 2013, upon the requirement of the State Council, the PBCinitiated the establishment of the Inter-Ministerial Joint Meeting for Financial Regulation andCoordination. In July 2017, the Fifth National Financial Work Conference decided to set up the 10 / 11BIS central bankers' speeches
Financial Stability and Development Committee under the State Council, in which the PBCserves its General Office and takes the lead in preventing and defusing systemic financial risks.In 2018, the third plenary session of the 19th CPC Central Committee adopted the reformscheme of Party and state institutions, which stipulated that the PBC should be responsible fordrafting important laws and regulations concerning banking and insurance sectors and designingthe fundamental prudential regulation system.Looking forward, as the socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era, theprincipal contradiction facing Chinese society has evolved. The country’s economy has shiftedfrom fast growth to high-quality growth, but there remain many challenges and tasks to beaddressed in the reform and development of the financial system. It is our firm belief that, underthe strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Xi Jinping at its core, the giant shipsymbolizing China’s financial cause will continue moving steadily forward into a promising futurewith prospects of new achievements in the financial development and reforms! 11 / 11BIS central bankers' speeches

    LAUNCH OF  MOBILE MONEY INTEROPERABILITY PHASE II   SPEECH DELIVERED  BY  DR ERNEST Y. ADDISON  GOVERNOR, BANK OF GHANA     GHIPSS, ACCRA NOVEMBER 28, 2018   
 1   His Excellency the Vice President, Alhaji Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia,  The Minister for Communications,  The Board and Management of GhIPSS,  CEO of the Ghana Chamber of Telecommunications,  CEOs of Telcos and Financial Institutions,  Invited Guests, the Media, Ladies and Gentlemen.  Good Morning  1. It's an honour to witness the launch of the second phase of the Mobile Money Interoperability (MMI) project.  This is undoubtedly another major milestone in our quest to deepen financial intermediation and inclusion; while digitizing the economy and levelling the playing field for both the banked and unbanked.   2. As you will recall, the first phase of this project was launched in May, 2018 with tremendous success. I must state that though 
 2  the significance of the project was not lost on us at the outset, international commendation subsequent to the launch, has underscored its uniqueness and novelty in the global payments industry.  3. Before proceeding, let me acknowledge and thank His Excellency, the Vice President, Alhaji Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia for the vision, unflinching support and dedication from the conception of this homegrown project initiated by the Bank of Ghana way back in 2007 to its full implementation today. Also, I would thank the banks, mobile money operators and fintechs for the strong collaboration with GhIPSS and the Bank of Ghana in the execution of the project. The zeal and commitment exhibited during the successful execution of this project is commendable and signals good prospects for developing an inclusive, safe and efficient payments ecosystem for the Ghanaian economy.  
 3  4. It is gratifying to note that the performance of the interoperability platform since implementing the first phase has been impressive based on the key pillars of CONVENIENCE, ACCESSIBILITY, and VALUE FOR MONEY. Since then, total transaction value and volume has increased from GH¢8.3 million and 96,907 respectively in May 2018 to GH¢32.6 million and 319,094 respectively in September 2018, representing 292.8 percent and 229.3 percent growth in value and volume respectively. This growth trend is expected to increase further when the second phase becomes fully operational and other innovative products and services become available.   5. Ladies and Gentlemen, I am pleased to inform you that at the recent Annual Global Policy Forum of the Alliance for Financial Inclusion (AFI) held in September 2018 at Sochi Russia, Ghana won three (3) of the eight (8) awards, including the technology award in recognition of the interoperability project. As a result of 
 4  these laudable achievements, we have hosted a number of visitors from central banks on the African continent to understudy the project design and implementation, with more visits scheduled for next year.  6. His Excellency, Ladies and Gentlemen, with the completion of the second phase of the interoperability project, Ghana has now achieved its objective of establishing an integrated and interoperable payments ecosystem. All the three (3) key national payment circuits, namely; mobile money, e-zwich and gh-Link are now interoperable, enabling seamless movement of funds across these systems.   7. As we develop a digital financial ecosystem, the integrity of the service delivery channels becomes paramount. Transmission channels for electronic payments should guarantee security of transactions. This can be achieved through adherence to 
 5  international best practices and standards in the acquisition, deployment and management of channels. Consequently, the Bank of Ghana has drafted Guidelines on Operations of Electronic Payment Channels which will provide a framework for management of an efficient and secure transmission of electronic transactions across various payment channels. We also must bear in mind issues regarding cyber security during electronic transfers and ensure that the proper structures and systems are in place to handle such threats.   8. With the implementation of the second phase of this infrastructure, payment service providers would have the opportunity to scale up access to financial services through digital channels. However, a strict financially inclusive society must ensure that financial products are accessible to meet the needs of different categories of customers.   
 6  9. Currently, most of the digital financial products available in the Ghanaian ecosystem are in the category of savings, payments, investments and insurance. Credit products receive less attention thereby limiting the capacity of the unbanked and underserved to borrow for economic activities. A deliberate and concerted effort to develop an electronic credit market is therefore necessary to promote financial inclusiveness.   10. In this regard, the Bank is working with Financial Sector Deepening (FSD) Africa to implement a credit market diagnostic project. The project will assist in identifying constraints to credit delivery and propose measures to overcome them. This will complement efforts towards expanding the scope of financial access to both the banked and unbanked in society.     11. His Excellency, as the sole regulator of the Mobile Money sector, the Central Bank will ensure that right things are done by the various players in the sector. We will continue to regulate 
 7  and monitor activities within the space and ensure that all participants play by the rules. The Bank of Ghana has a key responsibility to safeguard the integrity of the financial system to underscore the trust that is central to financial deepening and development. It is therefore critical to ensure the confidentiality of transactions, privacy of data collected by operators in this space (including personal and financial data), the security of transactions, and smooth operations of all stakeholders and regulators providing complementary services in this space.    12. The interoperability that exist between e-zwich, bank accounts and mobile money wallets, offer participants  an endless opportunity to develop various value added services to the public.  Let me therefore challenge Fintechs to work closely with banks, non-bank financial institutions and especially rural and community banks to come out with several other products and services that will further bring banking and financial transactions closer to the public.  I see endless opportunities with 
 8  this financial inclusion triangle and I hope the players also realise the enormity of opportunities it presents.  13. To conclude, I wish to thank all stakeholders who in one way or the other have helped in the full implementation of the interoperability project and to say that the future of Ghana’s financial inclusiveness and cash-lite society is well within reach.  14. Thank you for the attention. 
Benoît Cœuré: The role of the European Union in fosteringconvergenceSpeech by Mr Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, atthe Conference on European Economic Integration (CEEI), Vienna, 26 November 2018.*   *   *This conference was renamed 14 years ago to reflect the “growing together of Europe”. In myremarks today I would like to focus precisely on these three topics: growth, Europe andtogetherness. I will argue that these three elements are needed to accomplish what the Treaty onEuropean Union promises: economic and social cohesion.I will focus my remarks today on the economies of central, eastern and south-eastern Europe(CESEE), covering both those that are already part of the European Union (EU) and those thatare EU candidate countries or potential candidates.I will start with a brief review of the current state of convergence of CESEE economies, and thenexplain how three key European policy areas – the completion of the Single Market, the launch ofa true capital markets union and the targeted use of EU funds – can help accelerateconvergence and thereby also foster cohesion in Europe.The current state of convergenceCESEE economies have seen significant improvements in living standards over the past twodecades, in both absolute and relative terms. Since 2000, growth in real GDP per capita hasaveraged 3.8% in the region as a whole, compared with 1.4% for the EU-28. As a result, we haveseen these economies make measurable and welcome progress in catching up to the EUaverage.But this catching-up process has been neither linear over time nor homogeneous acrosscountries. You can see this on my first slide.123456 1 / 16BIS central bankers' speeches
Clearly, for most countries, convergence towards the EU-28 average has practically stalled sincethe outbreak of the financial crisis in 2008 – this is the difference between the yellow dot and theupper end of the blue bar.And before the crisis, convergence was noticeably faster in economies that were already part ofthe euro area. In many of these economies, relative living standards increased by half, from 40 to50% of the EU average in 2000, to around 70% in 2016. But the further one moves to the right onthis slide, and contrary to what neoclassical growth theory would suggest, the less compellingstrong convergence becomes.In the Western Balkans, for example, while relative income levels have increased, they havedone so at a much slower pace. At current growth rates, fast convergence towards the EU-28average will remain illusory for many EU candidate countries or potential candidates.These economies, and this you can see on my next slide, would need much higher GDP growthrates than in previous years to even reach half of the EU-28 average within the next 20 years orso, with the possible exception of Montenegro. 2 / 16BIS central bankers' speeches
Clearly, this pace of convergence is disappointing. It implies that living standards in Europe willremain highly varied and uneven for a considerable period of time, even within the EU. And ifthere is no credible prospect of lower-income countries catching up soon, there is a risk thatpeople living in those countries begin questioning the very benefits of membership of the EU orthe currency union. Such doubts would be particularly worrisome in the unstable world we arecurrently living in.We need the EU to remain a force for change, a source of growth and development and ananchor of stability. Action is therefore needed on two main fronts: first, to bring convergence inEU Member States back onto its pre-crisis path and, second, to jump-start convergence in EUcandidate countries and potential candidates.To understand what needs to be done to tackle both challenges, it is useful to look at the driversof growth and the factors that have recently been holding them back. You can see this on mynext slide. 3 / 16BIS central bankers' speeches
What you can see here is that, since the crisis, growth in all CESEE economies has essentiallyslowed because of two main factors: a sharp drop in total factor productivity (TFP) growth and, toa lesser extent, in the contribution of capital to growth.There are two things worth highlighting here.The first is that it is highly unusual that pre-crisis convergence largely reflected technologicalprogress and innovation. During the transition phase, growth is typically based on capital andlabour accumulation, and only later on TFP growth. Or, to borrow the words of Paul Krugman, itis based first on perspiration and only later on inspiration.The flipside is that these economies are now faced with a notable capital shortfall. The capitalstock per person employed remains substantially below the EU-28 average in almost all CESEEeconomies. You can see this on my next slide on the left-hand side.78 4 / 16BIS central bankers' speeches
In CESEE euro area Member States, it also remains well below other emerging economies,such as South Korea, with similar per capita income levels. And, worse, investment rates havefallen further since the crisis in all CESEE economies. You can see this on the right-hand side.The second fact worth highlighting is that the remarkable contribution of productivity to growth,both in the upswing and in the downturn, is likely to be an artefact of the growth model adopted bymost CESEE economies. This growth model relies, by and large, on deep integration in globalproduction chains.You can see this clearly on my next slide. CESEE economies are some of the world’s mostintegrated. They are far more integrated in global value chains than their EU peers, for example.Sizeable foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows in the pre-crisis period – which you can see onthe right-hand side – have promoted the role of CESEE economies in global productionprocesses. These inflows accounted for around 6% of GDP in the run-up to the crisis. In the EU-28 as a whole, FDI inflows accounted for just 3.4% of GDP over this period. 5 / 16BIS central bankers' speeches
The role of FDI in supporting TFP growth is well known. By integrating local firms into globalvalue chains, it facilitates the transfer of technology and expertise. The transfer of technology,moreover, does not stop at firms directly integrated into global value chains, but also extends totheir domestic suppliers via local production networks.Empirical evidence shows that, in the case of central and eastern European (CEE) economies,this transfer of technology has contributed to both strong TFP growth in the run-up to the crisisand to its more recent slowdown.You can see this more clearly on my next slide. There is a very close link between TFP growth inCEE economies and TFP growth in non-CEE EU countries. This link likely reflects the scale andscope of technology spillovers. So, as FDI inflows decelerated and participation rates in globalvalue chains levelled off, TFP growth in CESEE economies abated too.9101112 6 / 16BIS central bankers' speeches
Global value chains as a source of TFP growth in the futureIn sum, therefore, this diagnosis highlights two key facts: CESEE economies have a lack ofcapital, and a strong reliance on global production processes.The easy answer, of course, is to brush away weakness in FDI inflows as a temporaryphenomenon. After all, if the law of declining marginal returns on capital continues to hold, weshould still expect capital to flow into catching-up economies, rebooting TFP growth.I would be somewhat more cautious, however. It is true that weakness in trade and investment,worldwide, has been part of the collateral damage from the crisis. As we leave this legacybehind, headwinds should fade too.But the recent shift is also likely to reflect developments of a more structural nature – that is, theslowdown in global value chain formation may well persist.There are three main reasons for this. First, natural disasters and increasing climate-relateddisruptions have led firms to rethink the length and design of their value chains to mitigate therisks of costly supply disruptions. This is becoming increasingly visible and may still amplify asclimate change takes its toll on our economies.Second, in the past sizeable wage differentials for unskilled labour made the internationalfragmentation of production processes worthwhile. Some of these wage differentials havenarrowed considerably as emerging economies have grown richer. In the EU CESEEeconomies, for example, real wages have increased by slightly more than 50% since 2000. In theEU-28, real wages grew by 18% over the same period.1314 7 / 16BIS central bankers' speeches
And, third, the increased use of robots and artificial intelligence has the potential to turn globalvalue chains on their head and cause firms to reconsider offshoring practices.The second and third factors may be the most pressing ones.Put simply, if robots can deliver the same output more cheaply, more efficiently and closer to theconsumer, then firms may have fewer reasons to spread production across countries. By someestimates, the average price of industrial robots has declined by about 40% over the past tenyears and is projected to fall considerably further. A survey by the Boston Consulting Grouprevealed that more than 70% of senior manufacturing executives in the United States think thatrobotics improve the economics of local production.The implication is that, to the extent that growing automation and narrowing wage differentialsmake the outsourcing of production processes less profitable, policymakers in CESEEeconomies, and in emerging market economies more generally, will need to think aboutdeveloping other growth models.To reboot TFP growth and deepen capital accumulation they will need to stimulate domesticinvestment spending and help new, innovative industries to grow and develop. Only in this waywill convergence towards the EU-28 average accelerate.These should be joint efforts, however, which brings me to the second part of my remarks.Europe can and should help, in three main ways. First, by providing the market that makes thedevelopment of new industries profitable. Second, by channelling funds to sectors and countrieswhere capital can be used most productively. And, third, by providing direct financial assistanceto foster convergence and support national reform efforts.Reaping the benefits of the Single MarketLet me take each of these points in turn, starting with the market dimension.The EU’s Single Market can be a valuable source of competitive advantage for firms located inCESEE economies, in particular when competing with other economies at similar stages ofdevelopment.It is the largest market in the world, offering the benefits of enormous economies of scale, andhas helped establish product and safety standards that are used worldwide. There is compellingevidence that the Single Market has had a positive impact on exports, investment, innovation andproductivity.To exploit its full potential, and to accelerate convergence, two things need to be done.First, Member States need to strengthen its enforcement so that Single Market initiativestranslate into concrete and positive effects on the ground.A key ingredient for this is efficient administration at all levels of government. Indeed, a lack ofreal convergence in income levels is, more often than not, the result of a lack of convergence ininstitutional quality. You can see this on my next slide – a slide I like to show because I think itmakes a compelling point, notwithstanding the usual caveat on the two-way causality betweeninstitutional quality and income levels.151617181920 8 / 16BIS central bankers' speeches
Most CESEE economies are still in the lower left-hand corner, meaning there remains asignificant gap in overall institutional quality compared with the average level observed in the EUas a whole.Some EU Member States have recently renewed their interest in the process leading toparticipation in the exchange rate mechanism (ERM II) and the adoption of the euro. This couldbecome a fundamental catalyst for institutional reforms in the years to come.Second, the scope of the Single Market must be broadened.For the EU, this means expanding its reach into industries that are prime drivers of innovationand catalysts for future growth.This is particularly relevant for CESEE economies. As you can see on my next slide, most ofthese countries are still classified as modest or moderate innovators. There have been somenotable improvements in certain countries over time, but in others the process of graduallycatching up with their EU peers appears to have stalled, or even to have backtracked, in recentyears. 9 / 16BIS central bankers' speeches
The first priority is therefore to complete the Single Market for services, which already account fortwo-thirds of global GDP and employment, and represent many of the potential growth sectors inthe age of digitalisation and automation.Research by the ESCB’s Competitive Research Network (CompNet) shows, for example, thatmany firms in the EU services sector are far behind the productivity frontier, particularly inCESEE economies. Reallocating capital and labour to more productive firms would help boostoverall competitiveness and support employment.A second, and more direct, avenue is to increase efforts to build a “European data economy”, ora digital single market, as also advocated by the European Commission in its communicationlast week. Digitalisation offers a particularly promising opportunity for catching-up economiesto leapfrog more advanced economies and adopt new technologies faster than them, therebymitigating the risk of being hurt by reshoring and premature deindustrialisation.Convergence and the role of the capital markets unionThe second key area where Europe can help – which is close to the heart of this conference – isby channelling funds to where they can be used most productively.There is compelling evidence of the importance of finance for technological innovation and,ultimately, long-run growth rates. Differences in the quality of financial intermediation acrosscountries have been found to have significant implications for economic growth.In particular, research is increasingly challenging the view that bank and market-based financetend to support economic development and living standards in similar ways.21222324 10 / 16BIS central bankers' speeches
Evidence is growing globally that large banking systems are associated with more systemic riskand lower economic growth, in particular as countries grow richer. In addition, recent work byECB staff highlights that, during the euro area sovereign debt crisis, capital misallocationincreased substantially among firms that were more reliant on bank finance.Other research suggests that deeper equity markets are more effective in promoting innovationand productivity and, hence, in bringing economies closer to the technological frontier. RecentECB research, for example, suggests that if an EU Member State were to increase its ratio ofstock market capitalisation to bank credit from the 25th to the 75th percentile, the average growthrate of its most high-tech industry could be expected to increase by 3.1 percentage points,everything else being equal.None of this is to say that banks will become redundant. They will continue to play their key socialrole of pooling savings and engaging in maturity and risk transformation.But recent findings are increasingly reflected in the ongoing policy discussion. The Europeanpush towards a capital markets union, for example, reflects not only the need for increasedcross-border risk-sharing in a currency union, but also the hope that deeper and better-integratedequity markets will support innovation and productivity growth in the European Union.This also includes making new innovative financial technologies available to firms and ensuringthey are as safe as conventional technologies. Europe is spearheading this process. Europe’sPayment Services Directive (PSD2), for example, has been revised to introduce morecompetition in financial intermediation by requiring banks to share account information with newcontenders.China, of course, is a prime example of new financial technologies supporting growth in thetransition towards higher income levels. Although EU data requirements are more stringent – forgood reason – there is considerable scope for such technologies, if used prudently, to also fostergrowth and convergence in the EU.On my next slide you can see that in Europe more generally, and in most CESEE economies inparticular, these technologies have not yet gained much traction. In other words, progresstowards a true capital markets union can both support the funding of investments, therebyhelping overcome the current lack of capital accumulation, and, at the same time, foster the useand distribution of new financial technologies that may themselves become a source ofgrowth.252627282930 11 / 16BIS central bankers' speeches
Using EU funds to foster convergenceThe third area where Europe can help is arguably the most contentious one. It relates totransfers between Member States to foster convergence in the EU.Such transfers are already happening, of course. Cohesion policy, designed to reduce structuraldisparities among regions and Member States, was the second largest item in the EU’s 2014-20budget. Over this period, and this you can see on the left-hand side of my last slide, thecumulated available funds for CESEE countries range from 8 to 21% of average annual GDP,with the allocation of resources linked to prevailing income levels. In other words, these funds arenot negligible. 12 / 16BIS central bankers' speeches
One problem, however, is that not all countries are equally successful in accessing them. Onereason for this is linked to the importance of institutional quality, which I mentioned earlier. Youcan see this on the chart on the right-hand side, which suggests there is a positive correlationbetween institutional quality and a country’s ability to effectively absorb available transfers andsecure new funding opportunities.Such patterns are even more visible when considering EU funding opportunities for socialpolicies, education and training. Under the European Fund for Strategic Investments plan, forexample, CESEE economies have only been able to attract less than 5% of total fundingallocated to social infrastructure projects.This means two things.First, we need to strengthen the ability of receiving economies to access and absorb funds. Thisshould be part of the broader effort to improve institutional quality.Second, EU allocation rules should be made as simple as possible. The European Commissionhas already made several important suggestions in this respect, with a single rulebook plannedto cover several EU funds, less red tape and lighter control procedures for businesses andentrepreneurs benefiting from EU support. Such initiatives are essential if we want people andcompanies to take full advantage of the opportunities that the EU provides.ConclusionLet me conclude.3132 13 / 16BIS central bankers' speeches
Achieving similar standards of living across our continent should speak to our highestaspirations. It is a recognition of history that economic prosperity, opportunity and peacefulsocieties are closely linked and mutually reinforcing. The prospect that relative income levels inEurope, without further action, will remain unacceptably large for the foreseeable future istherefore a warning sign. It should urge policymakers to think in new ways about howconvergence can be accelerated, and what role Europe itself should play in this process.I have highlighted today that we must begin by acknowledging that convergence requires jointefforts and responsibility. It requires Member States to translate EU initiatives andrecommendations into concrete and positive effects on the ground, and candidate countries andpotential candidates to achieve institutional excellence as early as possible in the transitionprocess. Convergence must be built on strong institutions. And adhering to standards, EUstandards, is a powerful vehicle for growth.Accelerating convergence also requires the EU, and the euro area in particular, to helpunderwrite this process. This includes completing the Single Market, building a new digital marketand being serious about developing a true capital markets union. Transition economies needboth the market and the capital to nurture and feed domestic growth initiatives.Thank you.I would like to thank Alessandro Giovannini for his contributions to this speech.

Gent Sejko: Address on remittances of the Albania diasporaWelcome address by Mr Gent Sejko, Governor of the Bank of Albania, at the high-level meetingon the remittances of the Albanian diaspora, Tirana, 14 December 2018.*   *   *Your Excellency, Minister Majko,Dear guests and colleagues,It is a special pleasure to open today’s meeting, which takes place after a year of intensivecoordinated effort between our institutions toward the achievement of common objectives inrelation to remittances of the diaspora, and other important issues. Today, a year after theMemorandum of Understanding was signed, I have the pleasure of noting that the materializationof these efforts has been reflected in the undertaking of a number of commitments and projectsin pursuit of the objectives set out below.The importance of remittances to the Albanian economy, to family welfare and to development ingeneral is highlighted in many communications of the Bank of Albania. In this context, during2018, the Bank of Albania engaged its resources in developments aimed at creating thenecessary prerequisites for an efficient channelling of such incomes into the Albanian economy.International initiatives in the field of remittances underline the importance of reducing the costsand increasing the efficiency of remittance services, thus implying the need to intervene in theretail payment market, in both remittance-sending and remittance-receiving countries.For this reason, the Bank of Albania, as we have pointed out at the beginning of this cooperation,has engaged in a series of projects aimed at analysing the domestic market with a view toidentifying and addressing the needs for intervention. These projects are assisted by the WorldBank and funded by the SECO.  I take this opportunity to once again thank these institutions fortheir contribution and support.Moreover, the Bank of Albania and the National Payment Systems Committee has alreadyadopted and is implementing the national strategy for the retail payments market. This strategyaims to create a contemporary and comprehensive market of retail payments, supported bysecure and efficient infrastructures, as well as by a wide range of payment instruments andservices that meet the needs of financially capable individuals to make payments across thecountry. Incorporating financial inclusion into the Bank of Albania’s objectives, this strategy hasset ambitious quantitative targets aimed at doubling the number of bank account holders (from38% in 2014 to 70% in 2022) and increasing the number of electronic payments per capita (from4.3 to 2016, to 10 in 2022).However, in order to achieve these objectives, a concrete and detailed action plan is needed.This action plan would require the support of all the stakeholders in the payments market, as wellas interventions in many aspects, such as:1. improvement of the applicable legal and regulatory framework;2. development and improvement of financial services infrastructures;3. expansion of the number and use of accounts and payment services;4. expansion of access points for these services;5. increase of education, awareness and financial inclusion;6. increase of the volumes of transactions processed by payment systems.While the strategy was only recently approved, in June, concrete steps have been taken in this 1 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
regard, for example, the drafting of the bill “On Payment Services in the Republic of Albania",which transposes the revised directive of the European Union “On payment services” (PSD2).The adoption and implementation of this bill is considered to have a direct impact for fosteringcompetition and innovation in the field of retail payments, thus promoting efficiency and reductionof the costs for using them. Moreover, the bill is expected to enhance transparency in theservices provided by the market and to create a consolidated framework on consumerprotection, a very important component for our market. Last but not least, the bill also aims toexpand the presence of bank services across the territory of the country (including rural areas).Beyond legal improvements, important steps have been noted in the framework of financialeducation. I would like to highlight the initiative undertaken in cooperation with the World Bank,and funded by the SECO, for the implementation of Project Greenback 2.0 in Berat. This projectconsists in enhancing financial inclusion and financial education for emigrants and their families,who receive these funds, as well as in establishing effective channels in terms of costs for thedelivery of these funds.In addition, to expand the market knowledge regarding remittances, in June, the Bank of Albaniapublished “Remittances: A support for development". This publication is entirely dedicated toremittances and adopts a comprehensive approach to various aspects in the domestic market.Some of these aspects are the macro-level analysis of remittances and their impact ondevelopment in general and on the receiving families; the analysis of the infrastructure of theremittances market in Albania, and the need for intervention, as well as providing adequatestatistics on remittances.An important step in the framework of financial education was also undertaken by the AlbanianAssociation of Banks. In June, a memorandum of cooperation was signed on establishing theAlbanian Network for Financial Education and fostering inter-institutional cooperation andcoordination in the field of financial education.However, there is still much to be done, despite the developments I mentioned earlier. In thiscontext, I would like to invite you all to continue with the efforts made so far, with the sameintensity, in order to modernize the domestic payment market.In the medium term, the Bank of Albania will focus its efforts on a number of initiatives, notably onfurther legal developments and infrastructure improvements.An important step in the medium term is the drafting of the bill “On the payment account". The billwill transpose the European Union Directive “On the Payments Account” and promotetransparency by creating a public register to present all commissions applied by institutions,which can be easily compared.At the same time, during this period, the Bank of Albania will engage in a number of infrastructuredevelopments that support financial inclusion, reduce the costs of using these instruments and isestimated to have an impact on the remittance market, mainly from the point of view ofremittance receivers and their use. Here we can mention the creation of a national platform forprocessing payments in real time (instant payment and processing of card payments). Theplatform creates conditions for the development of innovative and low-cost services and alsoaims at market segments that create ample volumes by targeting state institution payments aswell as daily payments that Albanian citizens make.Last but not least, I would like to thank the Government of Albania for the importance it places onthis matter and its continuous support. In particular, I would like to thank the ministries such asthe Ministry of Diaspora and the Ministry of Finance and Economy for their support and fruitfulcooperation. I am confident that we will continue, with the same intensity, our joint efforts tointegrate this very important factor into the Albanian economy at the fastest and broadest extentpossible.  2 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches

Firm Dynamics and Economic GrowthOpening remarks by Salvatore Rossi  Senior Deputy Governor of the Bank of Italy and President of the Institute for the Supervision of Insurance (IVASS)Rome, 19-20 December 2018Bank of Italy – CEPR – EIEF Conference

I am delighted to welcome you all to the Bank of Italy, and to open this workshop, which was jointly organized with the CEPR and the Einaudi Institute of Economics and Finance.Over today and tomorrow, 29 original papers will be presented, selected from more than 150. These works have been produced by distinguished scholars from academia and research institutions around the world. They cover a wide variety of topics relating to firm dynamics and its effects on economic growth. Two keynote lectures will also be delivered, and I would like to thank the internationally renowned speakers, Professor Ufuk Akcigit from the University of Chicago and Professor Gian Luca Clementi from New York University.There is no need for me to underline the importance of studying firm dynamics today. The recession which followed the global financial crisis hit the whole world almost simultaneously ten years ago, though to varying degrees in different countries. Firm dynamics is key to explaining the differences in its impact. Country-specific frictions to the physiological exit and entry of firms in the market may severely limit growth prospects for an economy. Italy is a case in point, as I will discuss later. In the short run, they affect and are affected by business cycle fluctuations and financial shocks.At this moment in time, after years of recovery, economic growth is slowing down somewhat all over the world. Forecasts made by international organizations are currently reflecting the decline shown by conjunctural data. Growing trade tensions, political uncertainty, and expectations that monetary stimulus will gradually be reduced in the main economic areas of the world are the most cited facts. In many advanced economies, the economic slowdown is raising concerns about potential output, since the recovery of recent years has not been accompanied by as buoyant an increase in productivity as we might have expected.That’s why firm dynamics is more important than ever before. Innovation and technology adoption by as many firms as possible is the main source of 
4growth and jobs in the economy, and they depend very much on the process of firm entry, survival, growth, and exit through which the market selects the most efficient and innovative players. New and young firms are those which drive input accumulation and output growth. If the most productive firms thrive and the less productive ones exit smoothly from the market, the economic system works well. These ideas are very old, dating back at least to Joseph Schumpeter’s ‘creative destruction’ and they are now an intrinsic part of empirical analyses from all around the world. Indeed, thanks to the efforts of several scholars and research centres, among which I would like to thank the OECD researchers that conducted the seminal FirmDyn project, we now have a lot of comparable data on firms’ entry, growth and exit from the market, over their entire age distribution, in each national system.These country-level indicators are of course deeply affected by business environments and policies. For instance, entry barriers and direct or indirect public subsidies to firms in trouble can alleviate the welfare costs of crises in the short term, but may have long-term negative effects on firm selection and economic growth. To take another example, if the judiciary works badly and private contracts are difficult to enforce, incumbents have a clear advantage over entrants. Finally, if the political system works badly, some firms may escape competition thanks to their political connections.Finance also plays a role in shaping firm dynamics. New businesses need money, which can’t always be provided by banks, because of the riskiness of the venture and the scarcity of collateral. Venture capitalists are the right answer, yet their contribution is quite varied across countries. Technological improvements, for which the Fintech label is a proxy, are now filling these gaps, but the process is uncertain and uneven. For now, at least in some countries, new and young firms have to rely on bank credit and face tight capital constraints. If we leave aside cross-country differences and do some time-series analyses, we notice a decline in business dynamism since the early 2000s all over the world: for most OECD countries, new firms’ entry rates are now significantly lower than at the beginning of the century. What are the causes of this phenomenon? One may be the possible increased market power of incumbents. Another may be the fact that technological change and globalization increase the ability of more productive firms to gain market 
45share. These two possible explanations have markedly different policy implications. The scientific debate is currently ongoing, and during this workshop other possible explanations will be discussed in depth by several presenters.Recent research has highlighted how firm dynamics may have a role in explaining not only long-term potential growth but also business cycle fluctuations. The procyclicality of entry rates could be driven by a tighter selection of new firms during downturns, and slacker entry requirements when the economy is doing well. While this phenomenon is a stylized fact, its implications for the propagation and persistence of aggregate shocks have only been studied quite recently. Moreover, the impact of recessions induced by financial rather than real shocks is still comparatively underexplored. Today’s presentations will also cover these important issues, which have clear implications for policies to stabilize the business cycle.Let me conclude with a few words on Italy. Its lack of business dynamism has been an important determinant of the sluggish productivity growth over the last 20 years according to most research in this field, much of which has been conducted by the Bank of Italy’s economists.From the mid-1990s onwards, aggregate productivity in Italy has grown at a significantly slower pace than in the rest of the euro area. Total factor productivity (TFP) has been virtually flat, and yet at the same time the ICT revolution and the ensuing globalization of production were exploding, helping most other economies to reap enormous benefits in terms of productivity and growth.The inability of Italian firms to do the same is normally attributed to the large share of micro and small firms in the system: those firms invest less in innovation and technology adoption, and are more vulnerable to global competition. Yet the small size of most firms is a dynamic malaise of the system, not a static one, and is caused by the lack of business dynamism. Italian startups grow less and for a shorter period of time than new businesses in other OECD countries. They are poorly selected over their early years of life: exit rates are generally flat over the age distribution, meaning that less productive firms are not wiped out from the market when they are young. As a result, Italian firms are older, smaller and less productive than those from other developed countries. 
6The causes of this lack of business dynamism are manifold. Italy holds negative records for some of the frictions I discussed before: judicial efficiency is particularly low and financial leverage is among the highest by international standards. We have several specific dysfunctions, such as widespread tax evasion, the political connections of entrepreneurs, and cronyism, all of which distort competition in the economy, and slow down creative destruction and firm churning, with negative consequences for aggregate growth. The structural reforms that are needed to put Italy back on track should address these diverse and complementary issues in a bold and coherent framework.*   *   *Ladies and gentlemen, I believe the discussions you are going to have today and tomorrow will provide important insights for addressing these issues too.I would like to thank the organizers of the workshop: Francesca Lotti and Francesco Manaresi from the Bank of Italy, Salomé Balsandze from the Einaudi Institute of Economics and Finance and the CEPR, and Luigi Marengo from LUISS-Guido Carli University. I also thank Alessandra Piccinini from the Bank of Italy for taking care of the logistics.I welcome you once again and wish you a fruitful exchange of ideas, as well as a pleasant stay in Rome.

Boris Vujčić: Macroeconomic developments and structural issuesin CEE countriesSpeech by Mr Boris Vujčić, Governor of the Croatian National Bank, at the Roundtable onMacroeconomic Developments of the 16+1 Economies, Magyar Nemzeti Bank (the central bankof Hungary), Budapest, 9 November 2018.*   *   *Accompanying slides of the presentation.Economic expansion in the CEE region can be expected to continue in the near term supportedby still favourable cyclical conditions. However, in many countries pace of growth mightmoderate, partly due to supply side constraints and maturing business cycles. Potential growthestimates indicate that in all countries output gaps are positive or have been closed, andunemployment rates are close or below pre-crisis levels, pushing-up the wage growth.While such a positive outlook for future growth is somewhat disturbed by rising risks to the globaleconomy, such as escalation of trade tensions or tightening of financial conditions, CEEcountries seem to be in a generally good shape to withstand the impact of negative shocks.Current account positions have improved and in many countries turned into surplus, whileinternational liquidity positions are ample. Also, economic recovery coupled with efforts to pushthrough fiscal adjustment programs led to improvement of general government balance andpublic debt was put on a declining path. Furthermore, financial systems in most countries remainrobust and resilient, as attested by withstanding the shocks emanating from the global financialcrisis and the European sovereign debt crisis.Despite fair growth prospects and subdued vulnerabilities, medium-term growth potential in theregion seems insufficient to ensure pre-crisis pace of real convergence. The most recent datashows that the convergence is still there, but it has markedly slowed down. At the current pace,many countries in the region would need decades to reach German, Austrian or Swedish levelsof income, countries that we like to use as benchmarks. The last crisis also showed that therecan be events that will hold back growth and convergence for a protracted period of time andeven work in an opposite direction, leading to divergence. We know that when it comes to livingstandards, in the long-run it is all about labour productivity, which can be decomposed intogrowth of capital per worker and growth of total factor productivity (TFP). While we can expect aninvestments to continue growing, it is not likely that the rates that we have witnessed in 2000s,with strong inflow of FDIs and related transfers of technology and know-how, will be seen againin the near future. That is why the TFP will ultimately prove to be the major determinant of long-term convergence. For us as policy makers, understanding the determinants of technology adoption, the TFPgrowth, is the key, as this gives us the channel to act through. There is an increasing number oftheories and empirical papers linking development and the adoption of technologies to the role ofinstitutions defined in a very broad way. And data support such outcome, here on a sample ofemerging market countries. There is a strong positive relationship between quality of institutionsand human capital on one side and growth on the other. Furthermore, in the context of new EUmember states, countries with better institutions tend to withdraw more EU funds, which isanother channel through which the government can help to increase the growth potential of acountry.When it comes to quality of institutions, developments are not encouraging. If quality is proxied byWorld Bank’s Worldwide Governance Indicator, there has hardly been any convergence towardsGermany, which can arguably be used as a benchmark. Notable exceptions are the Balticcountries where we have seen positive developments also in the aftermath of global financial 1 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
crisis. CEE countries also lag behind when it comes to the quality of human capital compared tothose EU countries that achieve the best results in PISA test in Math and Science (Finland,Sweden, Austria, and Germany). Developments over time are also not encouraging as in manycountries the PISA results have actually worsened during the last decade, which is a phenomenanot confined only to the CEE region, but to the wider Europe.Such developments are on the one side worrisome, but on the other give us the opportunity tostreamline and speed up reforms because potential gains can be substantial. EuropeanCommission has estimated that structural reforms that close only half the gap with bestperformers in different areas (market competition and regulation, R&D expenditure, skillstructure, tax structure, labour market participation, unemployment benefit ‘generosity’ and activelabour market policies), which does not appear to be overambitious, could have significantmacroeconomic effects. The level of GDP in 10 years after the reform would be around 7%higher in the CEE countries and around 12% after 20 years compared to the “no reform”scenario with effects on employment reaching a similar magnitude. The IMF also points tosignificant benefits of structural reforms in terms of TFP improvements. Even if we considerthese estimates as somewhat optimistic, welfare advances would be substantial.But how to get structural reforms right? There are in general two dimensions of structuralreforms. First, and in principle the easier one, are the reforms that bring us closer to theefficiency frontier. That said, it is quite likely that most of the low hanging fruits of productivitygains from sectoral reallocation and imports of foreign technology have been collected andfurther improvements may require a new generation of reforms. This second generation are thereforms that expand the frontier. They encompass, among others, product market reforms,competition policy, labour market reforms, public finance and taxation (including social securitysystem), human capital development, innovation policy, etc. Can we and should we act on all ormost of these different fronts simultaneously? Probably. Do we as economists and policymakerstruly understand all the synergies, complementarities and marginal effects of different reforms?Probably not to the extent that we would like. Are we on the same boat when it comes to theirpositive gains and externalities? I would dare say yes.We also have to keep in mind the political economy dimension of the process. We need toensure broad support for the reform agenda especially since there might be some short-termcosts of certain reforms. In that sense, lacklustre support for market economy and democracyas well as low faith in justice systems in CEE countries compared to long establishesdemocracies might complicate matters further. This is where policy transparency andcommunication plays an important role. Clearly, not everything we do will always get full supportfrom the broad public, particularly in the case of structural reforms with long-term gains andshort-term costs, but sometimes boldness is rewarded beyond our expectations. 2 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
Luis de Guindos: Redesigning Europe's financial landscapeSpeech by Mr Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, at the 6th Frankfurt Conference on Financial Market Policy, Frankfurt am Main, 14 December 2018.*   *   *It is a pleasure to be here today.As you know, there is a long tradition of the ECB participating in SAFE conferences here inFrankfurt. The second conference in 2014 was already dedicated to “Banking beyond banks”acknowledging important changes underway in the European financial landscape. Indeed, thiswas a prescient choice of topic given the growth of the non-bank sector, which has continuedunabated ever since. In a recent speech, I also highlighted the rapid growth of assetmanagement in the euro area and at the global level, and the impact this is having on thestructure of the euro area financial sector. In fact, in 2008, total assets held by investment fundsmade up just 15% of banking sector assets. In 2017, these assets had grown to 42% of totalbanking sector assets, amounting to €12 trillion. As the non-bank sector continues to grow, sodoes the need to ensure that our supervisory and regulatory framework is fit for purpose.At the same time, banks still play an important role in many areas of Europe’s financial system,notably in the financing of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). So a healthy bankingsector remains crucial to financing the economy, and despite the progress made in improvingthe resilience of European banks, some legacy issues from the crisis continue to weigh on thesystem.This has two implications for strengthening the financial pillar of Economic and Monetary Union(EMU), which will be the topic of my speech today.First, we need to shore up the banking sector further by thoroughly completing thereform agenda that emerged in response to the crisis. This means taking the remainingsteps to complete the banking union – in terms of both risk reduction and risk-sharing.Second, we need to facilitate the growing role capital markets and the non-bank sectorcan play in financing economic growth in a sustainable and resilient manner. This requiresboosting the capital markets union (CMU) agenda while ensuring that authorities are equipped toface the new challenges of a changing financial landscape. This will require the fragmentation ofEuropean capital markets to be overcome and the macroprudential toolkit to be extended beyondthe banking system to cover, in particular, the investment fund sector.Finalising post-crisis reformsI welcome the decisions taken by the Eurogroup to continue advancing the banking union,reforming the European Stability Mechanism and building euro area fiscal instruments.In the financial sector – which is my focus today – the response to the crisis has centred onaddressing weaknesses in the regulatory and institutional framework. The new Europeanregulatory framework is making Europe’s banks more resilient and gives authorities the tools toact when risks begin to build up. Furthermore, banking union elevates the supervision andresolution of banks to the European level.This strategy has paid off: substantial risk reduction has been achieved, is ongoing and shouldcontinue. Banks now hold more and better-quality capital than in the past, and have improvedtheir liquidity positions and leverage. Addressing legacy issues, such as high levels of non-performing loans (NPLs), is progressing well. For banks under direct ECB supervision, NPL12341 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
levels fell from €958 billion when the Single Supervisory Mechanism was launched to €657 billionin June 2018. The framework for resolution, following the introduction of BRRD and theimplementation of Minimum Requirements of Eligible Liabilities (MREL) also contribute toincrease buffers, reduce risk and thereby the scope for risk sharing.However, the euro area’s financial architecture is not yet complete.There is some good news: there is now an agreement to make the common backstop to theSingle Resolution Fund (SRF) operational, which will instil confidence in the markets that bankresolutions will happen in an orderly fashion. There is also a recognition that it is time to startpolitical discussions on the missing third pillar of the banking union – a European depositinsurance scheme (EDIS). The high level group in charge of the discussions must be ambitiousand ensure that we live up to the agenda laid down in the roadmap on completing the bankingunion agreed by finance ministers in 2016.The ECB has often made the point that the opposing sides of the debate – risk reduction versusrisk-sharing, and private risk-sharing versus public risk-sharing – are in fact complementary.Completing the institutional leg of the banking union, with the SRF and EDIS, would move uscloser to a level playing field. In a genuine banking union, banks would operate across bordersand diversify their sources of income, which would allow them to continue lending to the realeconomy even when faced with localised shocks. This would create private risk-sharing acrossthe euro area and shield regions from localised credit crunches.But a level playing field for banking would also enable risk reduction. Increased cross-bordercompetition between banks, backed by a solid system of European supervision and the windingdown of unwarranted national protections, could further incentivize banks into getting theirbalance sheets in order.At the same time, the SRF and EDIS would also constitute a form of private risk-sharing byproviding a final, powerful backstop. They enable bank resolution, limit contagion in the case ofbank defaults thereby contributing to safeguarding overall financial stability. This, in turn, wouldreduce the need for public risk-sharing in the first place. Such an approach is borne out by theexperience of other advanced economies, such as the United States, where hundreds of bankswere resolved successfully by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation with no long-termfiscal costs.While the case for completing the banking union is strong, supporting EDIS is seen by some astilting at windmills. Indeed, three years after the initial Commission proposal, progress has beenvery limited. But the potential benefits of EDIS are not the illusions of a romantic daydreamer likeDon Quixote; they are, in fact, very real. EDIS would provide uniform confidence in depositsacross Europe which would be beneficial for all European economies, as no single bankingsystem is immune to a potential bank default. EDIS would therefore further underpin EMU byensuring that a €1 deposit is just as safe, and just as valuable, wherever you are in the euro area.Fostering the resilient and sustainable development of Europe’s financial landscapeCompleting the post-crisis agenda is therefore crucial, but we should not only look back. Afterdealing with banking sector fragilities, we should now be shifting our attention to the steadilygrowing non-banking system, which is changing Europe’s financial landscape and whosepotential to contribute to growth has not been fully unlocked.A range of banking activities is increasingly carried out by non-banks, notably insurancecompanies and the investment fund sector at large. Total assets of the euro area investmentfund sector have expanded by roughly 170% between 2008 and 2017, on account of both netcash inflows and rising asset valuations.56 2 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
Deeper and more efficient bond and equity markets in Europe would permit economies of scaleand allow capital to be allocated to the most productive uses at the European level, in line withthe Single Market objectives. By enhancing cross-border private risk-sharing and consumptionsmoothing through cross-border holdings of assets, CMU can reduce the need for public risk-sharing.Developing capital markets would also alleviate the shortage of risk capital that hinders thegrowth of Europe’s innovative start-ups and SMEs by increasing the presence of investors withhigh risk-bearing capacity. As in the case of depositors, issuers and investors should enjoy thesame legal rights in capital market activities across the EU, irrespectively of their country ofdomicile. Furthermore, Brexit accentuates the need to develop and integrate the EU’s capitalmarkets to prepare for the likelihood that the City of London will play a reduced role in the future.In terms of legislation, the CMU agenda has already yielded some positive results, but a moreambitious long-term approach should be pursued.On insolvency frameworks, the Commission has put forward a number of proposals which aimto enhance aspects, such as the efficiency of debt recovery procedures.In the realm of taxation, adopting the proposal on a common consolidated corporate tax basewould help to reduce or remove the bias towards debt over equity in some Member States,thereby facilitating the development of equity markets.The creation of a pan-European personal pension product, for instance, would help channelmore savings into long-term investments through a portable, pan-European product.Finally, fostering a deep and efficient CMU means reviewing the supervisory framework to align itwith the cross-border nature of capital markets, enhance supervisory and regulatoryconvergence and remove possibilities for regulatory arbitrage, also crucial in the context ofBrexit.Indeed, the non-bank financial sector may harbour leverage and liquidity risks, requiring additionalefforts to address emerging vulnerabilities at the system level.First, the asset management sector is highly connected with other parts of the financial systemthrough ownership links, common asset exposures and the provision of wholesale funding tobanks.Second, liquidity mismatches and leverage often build up slowly over time. In the euro area, wesee that investment funds have been taking on higher credit risk and duration risk in the currentmarket environment. And there are strong indications that liquidity risks are building up in thesector with the share of less-liquid assets in the sector growing continuously since the globalfinancial crisis.Third, the overall leverage of the sector is difficult to grasp. Alternative investment funds do notface any binding restrictions on leverage. A tail of highly leveraged bond and hedge funds withleverage multipliers exceeding 30 compares to an average leverage ratio for banks of below 20 inthe euro area.As the global crisis has shown, we must remain vigilant to possible new risks that might emergein the financial system. We need to better understand the macroprudential dimension of risk inthe investment fund sector. And we need to further enhance the sector’s resilience to system-wide shocks.The existing regulatory framework, with the Undertakings for Collective Investment inTransferable Securities and Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directives as the main789 3 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
building blocks, is well designed to address micro-prudential and consumer protection concerns.However, additional tools need to be developed to address rising risks in the investment fundsector from a macroprudential perspective.Macroprudential policy is primarily preventive. The toolkit available to macroprudential authoritiesshould include ex ante tools to limit the build-up of risks associated with liquidity and leverage inthe investment fund sector, such as minimum mandatory liquidity buffers and redemption noticeperiods.The investment fund industry in the EU is furthermore highly concentrated in a few jurisdictions,but – due to the diverse asset holdings and investor locations – the impact of adversedevelopments in this sector may be felt across the EU. So we should consider elevating thesupervision of investment funds and the potential activation of macroprudential tools to theEuropean level. This would be also in line with the spirit of CMU.A comprehensive, long-term European strategy for a more complete financial unionLet me conclude. Finalising EMU reforms, completing banking union and capital markets unionmust stand out as unquestionable objectives. We need to pursue a comprehensive long-termEuropean strategy for building a more complete financial union that fosters both risk-sharing andrisk reduction, which, as I argued, are two sides of the same coin. This will strengthen thefinancial system in the long run.Achieving these objectives hinges on building a strong degree of trust between Member Statesand European institutions. It fundamentally hinges on looking beyond short-term national benefitsand pursuing European goals. Europe should live up to its ambitions.Thank you for your attention.See Constâncio, V.

Mario Draghi: Europe and the euro 20 years onSpeech by Mr Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, at Laurea Honoris Causa inEconomics by University of Sant'Anna, Pisa, 15 December 2018.*   *   *Next month, we will celebrate the 20th anniversary of the launch of the euro.The two decades in which the euro has existed have perhaps been exceptional. The first was theculmination of a 30-year upswing in the global financial cycle, while the second saw the worsteconomic and financial crisis since the 1930s. But, exceptional as they were, these two periodscan teach us some useful lessons about what still needs to be done.Monetary Union has succeeded in many ways, but it has not delivered the gains that wereexpected in all countries. This is partly the result of domestic policy choices and partly the resultof Monetary Union being incomplete, which led to insufficient stabilisation during the crisis.The way ahead, therefore, is to identify the changes that are necessary to make our MonetaryUnion work for the benefit of all member countries.We need to make these changes as soon as possible, but we also need to explain why they areimportant to the people of Europe.The rationale for one market, one moneyThe Single Market is often seen simply as an expression of the globalisation process, which overtime has even eliminated exchange rate flexibility. But the Single Market and globalisation are notthe same thing.Globalisation has led to higher overall welfare for all economies, and for emerging markets inparticular. But it is now clear that the rules that accompanied this process were not sufficient toprevent it from causing severe distortions. Open markets have heightened economic insecurityfor people exposed to intensified competition, and added to their sense of being “left behind” in aworld where the great wealth created has been concentrated in a few hands.From the outset, however, the Single Market was designed to reap the benefits of opennesswhile also tempering its costs for the most vulnerable; to promote growth while protecting thepeople of Europe from the injustices of untrammelled free markets. This was undoubtedly alsothe vision of Jacques Delors, the architect of the Single Market.The Single Market was conceived during a period of weakness in the European economy. Annualgrowth had averaged just 2.2% from 1973 until 1985 in the 12 countries that would go on to formthe euro area, down from 5.3% between 1960 and 1973. Growth potential had also fallen fromabout 5% per year at the beginning of the 1970s to around 2% per year by the beginning of thefollowing decade.The typical response of governments to low growth was to increase fiscal deficits. From 1973 to1985, public deficits in the euro area 12 averaged 3.5% of GDP, while in Italy the average was9% of GDP. Unemployment rose from 2.6% in 1973 to 9.2% in 1985 for the euro area 12. In Italy,it climbed from 5.9% to 8.2% over the same period.But the EU had a powerful tool at its disposal to raise growth: the common market. One reason that growth potential had decelerated was that intra-EU trade growth had stalled inthe early 1970s, because the common market covered mainly intermediate goods where growth1  1 / 10BIS central bankers' speeches
was already saturated.Trade in sectors with high R&D and skill content was restricted by non-tariff barriers, preventing productivity spillovers.The Single Market offered a way to remove these barriers, reverse the decline in economicpotential, and bring more people back into work.Yet the Single Market was never just about this. It also aimed to protect people from some of thecosts of the changes that would inevitably arise. This, in turn, would create a more favourablepolitical environment for advancing the process of European integration, following the setbacks ofthe 1970s.Unlike the wider process of globalisation, the Single Market allowed Europe to impose its valueson economic integration – to build a market that, to the extent possible, was free but just. Productrules could be used to protect consumers from lax standards in other countries, and protectproducers from unfair competition. And production rules could be used to protect workers byputting a floor on “social dumping” and upholding labour standards.This is why the launch of the Single Market agenda in the mid-1980s went hand in hand with astrengthening of common rule-making in the EU and of powers of judicial review. The opening ofmarkets was accompanied by the creation of a strong European authority to safeguard faircompetition; product standards became tighter, with the introduction of the geographicalindication protections for specific foods, for example. And safeguards central to the Europeansocial model were progressively embedded in EU law, in areas where the EU had the power toact.The Charter of Fundamental Rights has prevented a “race to the bottom” in terms of workers’rights. Legislation was adopted to curtail unfair labour practices, such as the revision of thePosted Workers Directive this year. EU legislation also protects those in less secureemployment. One example is the Directive on part-time work in 1997, which sought equaltreatment for part-time and fixed-term employees. Last year the EU institutions endorsed theEuropean Pillar of Social Rights to support equal opportunities and access to the labour market,fair working conditions, social protection and inclusion.EU legislation has not led to a complete harmonisation of labour protections across Europe. Butit has meant that the gap in labour standards across countries has gradually narrowed, even aslower-income countries have joined the EU. Research finds a process of upward convergence insignificant areas of social expenditure in the EU since 1980, although this has tailed off in recentyears. The same cannot be said at the international level.But the Single Market required greater exchange rate stability than a free trade area, and thisresulted in significant trade-offs for economic policy. These were well-articulated by TommasoPadoa-Schioppa in his famous “inconsistent quartet”. If European countries wanted to have thebenefits of managed open trade, they could not simultaneously have capital mobility, independentmonetary policy and fixed exchange rates.Governments initially responded to this conundrum by maintaining fixed exchange rates andintroducing capital controls on short-term flows, which allowed a degree of monetary policyautonomy. But as financial integration deepened and capital controls were progressivelyeliminated during the 1980s, fixed exchange rates became unsustainable.Due to the international financial storms raging at the time, the countries that had pegged theircurrencies to the Deutsche Mark (DM) within the European Monetary System (EMS) had toperiodically decide either to maintain an independent monetary policy and devalue, or to maintainparity with the DM and lose any sovereignty over their monetary policy.Given the frequency with which policymakers had to make these decisions, some countries lost 234 2 / 10BIS central bankers' speeches
both the benefits of exchange-rate stability and their monetary policy independence. The socialcosts were high. This process came to an end with the ERM crisis in 1992-3, when it ceased tobe credible for countries entering a recession to follow German interest rate rises.At the same time, devaluing repeatedly was becoming incompatible with the deep Single Marketthat countries were trying to build.Indeed, the prevailing view on devaluations was captured well by Nobel laureate Robert Mundell,who developed his theory of optimal currency areas in the belief that, “I could not see whycountries that were in the process of forming a common market should saddle themselves with anew barrier to trade in the form of uncertainty about exchange rates”. Exchange rate flexibilitywould have undermined the Single Market in two ways.First, it would have weakened incentives for firms to raise productivity, because they could havelifted competitiveness – if only temporarily – by devaluing rather than increasing output perhead. Yet Europe had witnessed time and again that such actions did not lead to lasting welfaregains.From the launch of the EMS in 1979 to the ERM crisis in 1992, the Italian lira was devalued seventimes against the DM, losing around half of its value cumulatively vis-à-vis the German currency.Yet average annual productivity growth in Italy was lower than in the euro area 12 over thisperiod, Italy’s GDP growth rate was roughly the same as that of its European peers, and itsunemployment rate went up by 1.3 percentage points. At the same time, consumer prices in Italygrew cumulatively by 223%, compared with 103% in the euro area 12.Second, support for the Single Market would be undermined in the long run if firms that did investin raising productivity could be deprived of some of the benefits by “beggar-thy-neighbour”behaviour through competitive devaluations in other countries. Open markets would not havelasted.Europe had experienced the problems created by exchange rate flexibility in the 1960s with thecommon agricultural market. Absent a single currency, the common agricultural policy wasbased on prices quoted in units of account. But successive currency crises, in particular arevaluation of the DM and a devaluation of the French franc in 1969, jeopardised trust in themarket, as the farmers affected demanded compensation for their losses.The issue was smoothed over by introducing monetary compensatory amounts to mitigatesudden changes in farm prices caused by abrupt adjustments in exchange rates. But the systemproved difficult to implement and sustain as it was virtually impossible to avoid distortions ofproduction and trade, which poisoned intra-Community relations.So, faced with an “inconsistent quartet” of policy choices, a single currency provided, at least inprinciple, a way to resolve them. It would allow countries to maintain stable exchange rates andtherefore benefit from openness within the Single Market, while managing as far as possible itscosts.Not all countries that had joined the Single Market also joined the euro, of course. Somecountries, such as Denmark, pegged their exchange rates to the euro. For other countries, theSingle Market represented the gateway to the euro. Five additional countries joined the euro inits first decade and three more in its second, but other smaller economies have stayed out sofar.Finally, there is the United Kingdom, the only large economy inside the Single Market that choseto stay out of the euro area. The United Kingdom is a particular case, not only for politicalreasons but also for structural reasons, such as the relatively low exchange rate pass-through it567891011 3 / 10BIS central bankers' speeches
had in the past.The benefits of one market, one money todayWe should consider what gains have been made as a result of having one market with onemoney.With the euro protecting the Single Market, trade growth has increased, with intra-EU exportsrising from 13% of EU GDP in 1992 to 20% today. Intra-euro area trade has risen both inabsolute terms and as a share of total trade with advanced economies, even as emergingmarket economies have entered the global market. Foreign direct investment (FDI) flows withinEurope have also grown, with inflows from the rest of the EU to Italy increasing by 36% from1992 to 2010.Behind the growth of intra-EU trade lies perhaps an even more important development, which isthe much closer intertwining of European economies through the deepening of value chains.Since the start of the 2000s, supply chain linkages between countries within the EU haveintensified at a faster pace and were more resilient during the crisis, compared with their supplychain linkages with countries outside the Single Market.The removal of customs barriers as part of the Single Market agenda has facilitated multipleborder crossings during the production process. Europe-wide standards have boosted intra-EUvalue chains by providing more certainty for firms about the quality of production in othercountries and encouraging the fragmentation of the production process that is typical of valuechains. And the single currency has further enhanced the process by eliminating the costs offoreign exchange payments and settlements and of hedging exchange rate risk.Participation in these value chains has brought gains for all countries, especially in terms ofproductivity spillovers. The imported inputs used in value chains generate a tangible boost toproductivity. And higher productivity in turn leads to higher wages. Integration within valuechains is associated with an increase in hourly compensation for all skill groups.Moreover, integrating into value chains has improved risk-sharing among European countries,since it has allowed the gains (and losses) of trade with the rest of the world to be more evenlyspread. Within the EU, close to 20% of export-supported jobs are located in a country other thanthe one that exports the final product.Around half a million Italian workers are involved in the production processes of companieslocated in other EU countries that export to the rest of the world. Italian firms themselvesparticipate strongly in global value chains and this is positively associated with labourproductivity.It is often this link to value chains that allows in particular the SMEs that are so typical of Italy’smanufacturing sector to survive and grow. In a world that is increasingly dominated by scale, thispermits Italy to retain one of its fundamental characteristics. Italy, through the Single Market andthe single currency, is deeply integrated into the European production process.The closer intertwining of European economies has had two significant effects on exchange raterelationships for euro area countriesFirst, the cost of not being able to devalue within Monetary Union has fallen. ECB analysis findsthat misalignments of real effective exchange rates are smaller – albeit more persistent – foreuro area countries than those between advanced economies or countries linked by peggedexchange rates, and these misalignments have actually become smaller in the second decadeof EMU relative to the first decade.111213141516171819202122 4 / 10BIS central bankers' speeches
At the same time, value chains have blunted the short-run benefits of competitivedevaluations. Since exports contain a greater share of imports, any boost to external demandassociated with a hypothetical devaluation is now offset by higher input costs from importedintermediates. As a result, participation in value chains has been found to reduce theresponsiveness of export volumes to movements in the exchange rate.So, any country hypothetically looking to devalue to regain competitiveness would have to do soto a much larger extent than was necessary in previous decades. And devaluations of such sizewould not only threaten the existence of the Single Market. They would also result in a substantialloss of welfare within the country carrying out the devaluation owing to the greater negativeimpact it would have via higher import prices. And studies on non-EU countries suggest that thewelfare loss would be greatest for the poorest in society, since poorer households tend to spenda larger share of their income on tradeable goods than richer households. This is also typicallythe case in euro area countries.But does being outside the euro provide additional benefits in terms of monetary policysovereignty? This is not so obvious.First, the single currency has actually allowed countries to regain monetary sovereigntycompared with the fixed exchange rate regimes of the past. Decision-making over monetarypolicy, which effectively belonged to Germany under the EMS, is now shared among all euro areacountries. And the size of euro financial markets has made the euro area less vulnerable to USspillovers, even as global financial integration has accelerated.Second, it is worth noting that the supposed advantages of monetary sovereignty – such as theability to engage in monetary financing of government spending – do not appear to be valuedhighly by countries that are members of the Single Market but not the euro. Such countries havea weighted average public debt of 68% of GDP (44% of GDP if the United Kingdom is excluded),compared with 89% for countries that use the single currency.In any case, as the history of Italy has shown, monetary financing of government debt did notlead to real long-term benefits. In periods where debt monetisation was more common in Italy,such as in the 1970s, maintaining a growth rate similar to its European peers required repeateddevaluations. Inflation reached unsustainable levels and hit the most vulnerable in society.Convergence and divergence in the euro areaBut if it is true that the supposed advantages associated with the freedom of being outsideMonetary Union belong to a memory that has been obscured by time and the dramas of therecent crisis, it is also true that in some countries various benefits that were expected from EMUhave not yet materialised.It was not mistaken, and nor is it today, to expect higher growth and employment to emerge fromthe “culture of stability” that Monetary Union would bring about. But it was inconceivable thatjoining Monetary Union alone would be sufficient to achieve this. We needed and continue toneed much more.To the founders of EMU, it was clear that establishing a well-functioning monetary union would bea long and gradual process. Historical experience suggested that opening markets could lead todifferentiated gains, with some regions profiting more than others. This had been the experienceof both Italy and Germany after unification in the 19th century.Several euro area countries have achieved significant convergence, particularly the Balticcountries, Slovakia and, to a lesser extent, Malta and Slovenia. In these countries, the gapbetween real GDP per capita and the euro area mean has been reduced by around one-third232425262728 5 / 10BIS central bankers' speeches
since 1999. Others that also started far from the euro area average – such as Portugal andGreece – have on balance been unable to close the gap considerably.But such divergences are not exclusive to the euro area. GDP per capita in the richest state inthe United States is around twice that of the poorest state, which is roughly the same gap as inthe euro area. And the dispersion of growth rates across euro area countries has fallenconsiderably over time and, since 2014, has been comparable to the dispersion across USstates.So what has driven the different convergence trajectory of countries, and how much is it relatedto membership of the euro? Convergence can be thought of in two ways.The first is convergence of real GDP per capita levels. This is a long-term process which isdriven by factors such as rates of FDI, productivity growth and institutional quality. Such factorscan be fostered by sharing a single currency, but they are not determined by it. Domesticpolicies, structural and institutional reforms, and contributions from EU structural funds are whatplay a crucial role here.The second concept of convergence relates to growth rates, i.e. how much business cyclesacross countries are synchronised, especially when major shocks hit. This is determined moreby monetary union membership, since the design of a monetary union affects the capacity ofcountries to adjust and stabilise demand during recessions.In the case of Italy, we see both long-term and cyclical factors at play. Between 1990 and 1999 –that is, before the introduction of the euro – Italy already had the lowest cumulative per capitaGDP growth of the original euro area members. From 1999 to 2008, it again had the lowest percapita GDP growth of all euro area members. From 2008 to 2017, it recorded the second lowestcumulative growth, behind Greece. And, if we look further back, the growth we saw in the 1980swas borrowed from the future, having been based on debt that was left for future generations tobear.So, low growth in Italy is a phenomenon that dates back a very long time before the euro. This isa supply-side problem, which is clear if one looks at regional performance. There is a correlationbetween GDP per capita in different Italian regions and some structural indicators, such as – justto take an example – the ease of doing business index compiled by the World Bank: the valuesfor the poorer regions are generally lower than those of richer regions.At the same time, the fact that Italy – and other countries – diverged further from the euro areaaverage during the crisis highlights two important points. First, that structurally weaker countriesare more vulnerable to economic slowdowns than others; and second, that our Monetary Unionremains incomplete in some key respects.There is a fair amount of evidence that countries that implemented decisive structural policiesrecovered faster from the crisis than others. In countries that made such changes, the labourmarket is now more responsive to growth, and the improved economic conditions have led togains in employment.  But alongside structural policies, different layers of protection arenecessary to ensure that countries can stabilise their economies during crises.Without appropriate backstops at the euro area level, individual countries in a monetary unioncan be exposed to self-fulfilling dynamics in sovereign debt markets. Such overshooting canaggravate adverse debt dynamics in downturns, inducing procyclicality in national fiscal policies,as we saw in 2011-12. Typically, sovereign borrowing costs should fall in a recession, but at thattime economies representing one-third of euro area GDP saw their borrowing costs becomepositively correlated with risk aversion. The result was a lack of stabilisation that harmed bothgrowth and fiscal sustainability.2829303132 6 / 10BIS central bankers' speeches
So it is the structurally weaker countries that most need EMU to have instruments to diversify therisk of crises and counteract their effect on the economy. I have talked before about howcountries like Italy, which had been weakened by decades of low growth and had no fiscal spacewhen the crisis began, saw a crisis of confidence in government debt turn into a credit crisis withmajor repercussions for employment and growth.Deepening private risk-sharing through financial markets is one key element in preventing suchevents from recurring. In the United States, around 70% of shocks are mitigated and sharedacross the individual states through integrated financial markets, whereas in the euro area theshare is only 25%. It is therefore also in the interest of the weaker countries in the euro area tocomplete banking union and to proceed with the construction of a genuine capital market.But national budgets will never lose their function as the main stabilisation tool during crises. Inthe euro area, around 50% of an unemployment shock is absorbed through the automaticstabilisers in national public budgets, significantly more than in the United States. The use ofautomatic stabilisers, however, depends on countries not being constrained by their debt level.So the necessary fiscal space will have to be created again so that budget interventions can bemade in the event of a crisis.Yet national fiscal policies also need a complement at the European level. We need aninstitutional architecture that gives all countries the necessary support to ensure that theireconomies are not exposed to procyclical market behaviour during downturns. This will only bepossible if the support is temporary and does not constitute a permanent transfer betweencountries, which would result in a failure to put in place the necessary fiscal consolidation, letalone the fundamental structural reforms needed for a return to growth.ConclusionIt is not a technocratic desire to see convergence across countries and the smooth functioning ofMonetary Union that has led me to frequently mention the importance of structural reforms inrecent years. Each country has its own reform agenda, but such reforms are the only way tocreate the conditions for sustainable growth in wages, productivity and employment and tounderpin our welfare state.In large part these measures have to be undertaken at the national level, but they can besupported at the European level by the recent decisions to launch an instrument for convergenceand competitiveness.However, to tackle future cyclical crises, the two layers of protection against shocks – thediversification of risk through the private financial system on the one hand, and publiccountercyclical support through national budgets and the fiscal capacity of the EU budget on theother – need to interact in a complete and efficient manner.The more progress we make in completing the banking union and capital markets union, the lessurgent – although still necessary – it becomes to construct a fiscal capacity, which could attimes serve to complement national stabilisers. Inaction on both fronts heightens the fragility ofMonetary Union in times of great crisis and the divergence between countries increases.It is clear that completing Monetary Union is the best way to prepare the transition to a form ofunion that is more complete. Monetary Union, a necessary consequence of the Single Market,has become an integral and defining aspect – with its symbols and its constraints – of thepolitical project whose central aim is a Europe that is united in freedom, peace, democracy andprosperity.It was an exceptional response – or to paraphrase Robert Kagan an anti-historical response –to a century that had seen dictatorships, war and misery, and in that respect was not dissimilar33343536 7 / 10BIS central bankers' speeches
to previous centuries. A unified Europe was part of that world order, itself the result of exceptionalcircumstances, which followed the Second World War.The intervening years have confirmed the rationality of the choices made at the European andthe global level. The challenges that have arisen have become ever more global in nature andneed to be tackled together, not alone. And this is even more true for Europeans, both at the levelof their individual nations and for the continent as a whole: rich but relatively small; strategicallyexposed, militarily weak.Yet today, for many, the memories that inspired those choices seem distant and irrelevant, andthe rationale behind them has been undermined by the misery created by the great financialcrisis of the past decade. It does not matter that we are emerging from the crisis. Elsewhere inthe world, the fascination with illiberal prescriptions and regimes is spreading; we are seeing littlesteps back in history.And this is why our European project is even more important today. It is only by continuing tomake progress, freeing up individual energies but also fostering social equity, that we will save itthrough our democracies, with a unity of purpose.Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal andSpain.See Study Group appointed by the Commission and presided by Padoa-Schioppa, T.

Faqe 1 nga 5  Honoured, It is my pleasure to be here today to discuss and take notes of this very important topic to our country’s economy, and would like to express my highest consideration to the Kosovo Banking Association, who on a daily basis is advancing Kosovo’s banking sector representation in all aspects. I consider that the topic of this conference is fitting as it has been raised at a time when the banking sector has made some quite significant progress in improving conditions for a sustainable financing of the economy.  *** In the last few years, the Kosovo banking sector has significantly increased its role in terms of funding the country’s economic growth by accelerating the pace of credit growth and considerably reducing credit interest rates. The easing of credit standard, followed by a reduction of credit interest rates, served as important incentives for increasing credit demand, thus resulting with an annual credit increase of 11.6 percent in October this year. This shows that access to finances, which has been long reported by businesses as a key barrier to the development of businesses, is now constantly improving. The same can be observed from the increased crediting of economy sectors that during previous periods had limited access to bank financing. The concrete examples of this are considered to be the sectors of agriculture and production, which have lastly been among sectors with highest increase of accepted credits. However, the total amount of credits issued to these sectors still remains low. In October 2018, the credits issued to the agriculture sector represented 3.8% of total credits to enterprises, whereas credits to the production sector represented 12.7% of total credits. Taking due account of the fact that today’s topic is related to the banking sector’s role in the funding of 
Faqe 2 nga 5  development, I would like to emphasise that a greater support to these economic sectors, and other sectors with high potentials of generating economic growth, is fundamental for achieving a more viable economic growth.  Nonetheless, we are aware that the diversification of the banking sector credit portfolio does not strictly rest on on the supply part, but rather and to a great extent, also depends from the credit demand part. In this context, I would like to emphasize that banks have a high financial potential for further increasing crediting, they have eased credit standards, and have significantly reduced the cost of access to bank financing. In October 2018, the average credit interest rate was 6.6%, which represents a significant improvement compared to a period not so long ago. These indicators show that credit supply has significantly improved. However, in order to ensure better crediting for sectors with currently lower access to bank financing, it is not enough to only improve credit supply, it is also necessary to ensure that these sectors’ credit demand is higher and of a better quality. With that I wanted to say that a more comprehensive approach is needed in terms of identifying and supporting the development of sectors that are of great importance to the country’s economic growth.  We consider that the establishment of the Kosovo Credit Guarantee Fund represents an important step forward in terms of increasing support to these sectors. So far, the amount of credits guaranteed by this Fund has reached EUR 71.3 million and is distributed to some 1,836 micro, small and medium enterprises. However, it is noted that the structure of credits, by economy sectors, which are guaranteed under this Fund is quite similar to the structure of unguaranteed credits, whereby credits for the trade sector prevail considerably. Therefore, we expect the Kosovo Credit Guarantee Fund, with the purpose of better serving its purpose of 
Faqe 3 nga 5  establishment, to play an even greater role in increasing credit financing for sectors with less access to bank financing but with great importance to a higher economic development.      *** In order to have a banking sector that ensures sustainable financing for the country’s economic development, the vital precondition is for the banking sector to be sustainable. Having said this, I would like to reconfirm that, based on all financial soundness indicators, Kosovo’s banking sector remain stable. I would like to attach particular importance to the good quality of the credit portfolio, which shows the bank’s good credit risk management, and could just as well serve as an important indicator of the favourable economic environment for banks operation in Kosovo. During September of this year, the rate of non-performing credits was 2.8%, which reflects a very good situation in terms of the quality of credit portfolio. The satisfactory stability of the banking sector is also reflected by other indicators, such as capital adequacy and liquidity indicators, which have consistently exceeded regulatory requirements and represent the high solvency of the banking sector.  *** The Central Bank of the Republic of Kosovo, with all of its capacities, is in the function of supporting sustainable development of the financial system, providing all necessary infrastructures to support the development of financial institutions and at the same time ensuring that their activity provides financial stability. In this regard, we are providing the banking sector with utmost modern standards of financial regulation and oversights, thus making banks and other financial institutions in Kosovo operate pursuant to rules that are applicable in all developed 
Faqe 4 nga 5  countries.  Also, the CBK provides the banking sector with a modern financial infrastructure. The interbank payment system, a modern, efficient and secure system, and the credit registry, which offer banks the most modern services in this field, are good examples to illustrate the financial infrastructure development in Kosovo. *** In recent years, the CBK has increased its engagement in the function of protecting the rights of financial service consumers, thus directly serving to the protection of public interest. Financial education activities represent a very important part of this intervention aimed at providing the public with clear information regarding opportunities offered by the financial system and their rights in the use of financial services. For the purpose of protecting citizens and businesses more effectively, we have drafted a Regulation on the disclosure of information by banks, and have established the Division for dealing with complaints by users of financial services, which addresses all complaints against financial institutions.  The CBK, from the moment it became functional, has and still fully supports the development of the financial system; however I would like to emphasize that we are committed to ensuring that the financial institutions’ development takes place in full compliance with the principles of protecting consumer rights In this regard, we are determined to further increase our commitment for protecting the rights of financial services users and requests from banks to carefully consider their legal requirements and policies in order to avoid any unreasonable obstacle that would impede normal interaction between citizens and the banking sector. We are committed and expect that the continuous development of the banking sector will create conditions for easier access and more favourable conditions for 
Faqe 5 nga 5  citizens and businesses in the banking services. This is in line with the Sustainable Development Objectives, prepared by the United Nations, whereby under the objective of economic growth at global level, the requirement of improving access to financial services for ensuring sustainable and inclusive economic growth is clearly emphasized. *** At the end of my speech, I would like to reiterate that Kosovo’s banking sector is in a sound financial situation and with a constant increase of funding to Kosovo’s sustainable economic development; however, it requires an even greater inter-institutional commitment for creating the necessary conditions so that this sector’s contribution to the country's economy is even greater. The CBK will continue to support all aspects of banking sector development, by providing the entire necessary both financial and regulatory infrastructure.  The close cooperation between the CBK and the banking sector, facilitated to a great extent by the Kosovo Banking Association, has allowed us to effectively address the needs for developing and maintaining the sector’s stability and we are therefore committed to further advance our constructive cooperation.  
1  FIU PRESENTATION TO  IBA MEMBERS   Opening speech delivered by Mrs. L. Matroos-Lasten Acting President Centrale Bank van Curaçao en Sint Maarten    On the occasion of the information session on:  AML/CTF within the International Banking Sector       Centrale Bank van Curaçao en Sint Maarten December 12, 2018       
2  Ladies and gentlemen, good evening,  I would like to express my gratitude to the Association of International Bankers (IBA) for its initiative in organizing this important seminar titled AML/CFT within the international banking sector. I am pleased to share my opening remarks with you. This year marks the 10-year anniversary of the global financial crisis. If we learned anything from the crisis, it is that international cooperation and policy coordination is crucial to shape a sound, transparent, and attractive financial system.   As the managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Christine Lagarde, stated “The time to fix the roof is when the sun is shining.” That is to say, we should not wait for (reputational) storms to come our way to act agile.   Ladies and gentlemen, our financial sector is of integral importance to achieve sustainable economic growth. Suffice to say is that, though its contribution has declined over the past 20 years, the international financial services sector remains a key economic pillar of Curaçao. The IFS sector generates about 6% of foreign exchange earnings, provides labor intensive high-skilled employment to more than 1,000 persons, and contributes approximately 6% of GDP. In addition to these direct effects, the sector has indirect spillover effects across related industries, including the business, telecommunication, transportation, and hospitality sectors.   Amid the increased complexity of financial transactions, it has become imperative for financial intermediaries such as international banks, to keep re-inventing themselves through new and innovative products and services. Simultaneously, the supervisory role of the central bank is to ensure proper controls to prevent systemic collapse and achieve market integrity. Today, I would like to touch upon the history of the International Financial Services (“IFS”) sector, the main challenges this sector is facing, what we have achieved so far, and what our next steps are.   Ladies and gentlemen, first allow me to take you back to the history of the IFS sector. By mid-1960s Curaçao had become a well-known international financial center for purposes of global tax planning. However, the prosperity of the IFS sector came to a halt with the termination of the Tax Treaty with the United States and the abolishment of the U.S. Foreign Withholding Tax in 1985. In addition, the sector was also negatively affected by other developments, such as the negative connotation of global tax planning and increased bundling as tax-exempt region.   Over the past years, however, Curaçao has taken several measures to meet international standards. One of the main measures taken was the enactment of a New Fiscal Regime in 2002 to be in full compliance with the policies of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) for fair tax practices. The new tax regime was created in line with the recommendations offered by the OECD, to avoid being labeled as a jurisdiction with harmful tax practices, and thus was intended to avert inclusion on the OECD’s ‘black-list’ of non-transparent offshore jurisdictions in 2000.   Ladies and gentlemen, let us now continue with the main challenges the IFS sector is facing. With the implementation of global regulatory standards, including Anti-Money Laundering (“AML”) and Combatting Financing of Terrorism (“CFT”) rules, banks have faced increased compliance costs 
3  in providing correspondent banking relations. In addition, tax information-sharing agreements that also result in more costs for the banks have added to the de-risking trend, which resulted in the ending of correspondent banking relations. Both the domestic banking sector and the international financial services sector in the Caribbean face this challenge. A correspondent banking relation is crucial for financial institutions in the Caribbean, given their limited access to foreign financial markets. Furthermore, without a correspondent banking relation, Caribbean financial institutions cannot properly service clients’ accounts. Recently, many correspondent banks have terminated their relations because of the high perceived risks of the Caribbean and Latin American Region. In the monetary union of Curaçao and Sint Maarten, however, the CBCS has informed correspondent banks on the effective implementation of AML-CFT regulations, and positive assessments of the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force (CFATF), which have led to favorable results. For example, JP Morgan has recently reinstated its correspondent relation with two major banks in Curaçao. The CBCS is continuing with its efforts toward correspondent relations to attain more of these favorable results, and thus minimize the de-risking effects.   The CBCS has always been active in promoting financial stability and minimizing risks via sound prudential and conduct supervision. The CBCS is constantly striving for ways to strengthen the financial sector by enhancing the quality and effectiveness of our supervision. Accordingly, we promote high standards of skills, integrity, and good governance among all our supervised institutions and individuals. Although there is no substitute for sound regulation, we are aware that overregulation prevents our jurisdiction to maintain a competitive position in the IFS sector. Hence, another challenge we face is to achieve a proper balance between the effectiveness of rules and regulations on the one hand and the related risks in the IFS sector on the other.  To attain this balance we believe that information-sharing and collaboration among the CBCS, the government, and IFS sector is crucial. Together we should strive to continuously reform the fiscal and legal framework of the financial industry to adapt to the ever-changing international business environment, thereby creating confidence for the (international) public.   Ladies and gentlemen, now I would like to pay attention to some recent achievements in the areas of regulation and supervision that could help strengthen the IFS sector. We have successfully and positively been assessed by the major standard-setting bodies over the past years, such as the OECD, the World Bank, and the FATF, and subsequently, have implemented their recommendations. In addition, Curaçao has recently signed the Base Erosion and Shifting (BEPS) Multilateral Instrument (MLI). Currently, 117 countries participate in the inclusive framework of the BEPS, representing more than 90% of world trade. The standards have been adopted by the European Union as one of the requirements that jurisdictions should meet to be excluded from the EU-list of non-cooperative jurisdictions. The CBCS has also recently been entrusted with the supervision of Securities Intermediaries and Asset Managers. Finally, the CBCS is in the process of becoming a signatory member of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO). With these positive developments in the areas of regulation and supervision, we are taking a further step in the right direction to strengthen the IFS sector which certainly benefits the international banking sector.  Ladies and gentlemen, after discussing the history, the main challenges, and the key achievements of the IFS sector, in my opinion, the question that remains is, what are our next steps? The CBCS understands that 
4  innovation is changing the environment in which you, as financial service providers, and we, as regulators and supervisors, are operating. With the need to process and analyze an ever-increasing volume, frequency, and granularity of data, we are prompted to implement Regulatory Technology (RegTech) and Supervisory Technology (SupTech) in our financial sector supervision to increase our effectiveness and efficiency. In our aim to preserve and foster the reputation of Curaçao as a sound, transparent, attractive, and reputable international financial center, we strive to achieve institutional agility and adaptability to guide our financial sector into this new, technology-driven, era. Research has shown that over 85% of Global FinTech’s are directed toward or related to the financial services business. This suggests that the financial services industry, especially the international banking sector, will most likely be considerably disrupted in the upcoming years. Considering that innovation and new financial technologies transcend borders and markets in which international banks operate, we should take charge in shaping the future of regional and global financial services provision.   Ladies and gentlemen, it is imperative that I underscore that the CBCS is committed to fight money laundering and terrorist financing, and will continue to provide guidance for the financial sector to combat these abusive and illicit practices within our jurisdiction. The CBCS is currently updating the AML/CFT Provisions & Guidelines (P&G). In addition, the CBCS, the Financial Intelligence Unit Curaçao (FIU), and the Gaming Control Board (GCB) have agreed to meet on a quarterly basis to provide a platform to monitor trends, local threats and vulnerabilities, and new developments in the area of AML/CFT.   In 2022 our jurisdiction will be subject to the fourth round mutual evaluation by CFATF. A vital part in the preparation for this mutual evaluation is the National Risk Assessment (NRA) to identify, analyze, understand, and address AML/TF risks in Curaçao. The NRA is on track to be completed by the end of 2019 which provides our jurisdiction sufficient time to be duly prepared for the next CFATF evaluation.   Allow me to close with the following statement: “It is always better to be compliant than be sorry”.   I thank you for your attention and wish you a fruitful seminar. 
 Check against delivery  Esteemed colleagues, Governors,  It is my pleasure to be here today and to address this distinguished panel. Before I start, let me just briefly thank our host Governor Matolcsy for his valuable insights. Building on some of the points raised, I would like to give the broad topic of central bank cooperation a somewhat more specific twist.  When talking about institutional cooperation, especially within such a diverse group of countries, we can indeed think of numerous possible layers for collaboration – from simple capacity building and information sharing to more complex aspects such as reserve management or bilateral swap lines. Yet in my remarks I will focus particularly on an emerging issue that we are still only getting to know – that is innovative financial technologies, or FinTech. I believe that this topic is of equal interest both in Europe and China.  Let’s look at the numbers. In the first half of this year alone global investment in FinTech companies hit 58 billion US dollars. In this regard, both Europe and China are among the leading markets worldwide. Even though I am representing the European side, I have to admit that in some domains – such as the level of FinTech adoption by the population – China is way ahead of its European peers.  While FinTech is a rather new phenomenon in the central banking community, much has already been said and written on this topic. I am pretty sure that most of you are well aware of the pros and cons associated with financial innovations, so I will not go into details on this issue. Yet let me just briefly mention some of the benefits and risks brought about by FinTech that I find key.  Looking into the benefits side, FinTech offers possibilities to boost economic growth by providing additional sources of credit, which is especially relevant for SMEs. In fact, it is estimated that by 2024 the global peer-to-peer market will be worth nearly 900 billion US dollars, growing by roughly 50% annually. I must say – quite an impressive trend, illustrating the scale of opportunities that alternative funding sources hold. Financial innovations may also enhance financial inclusion. World Bank data indicates that over 1,7 bn people globally still do not enjoy access to the formal financial system. FinTech solutions – such as mobile payments or crowdfunding platforms – can play a critical role in this regard, helping to ‘democratize’ access to finance and deepen our financial markets.  On top, FinTech creates instruments that may be used in enhancing the efficiency of financial sector regulation and oversight. Here I have in mind particularly the possibility to employ RegTech and SupTech tools to boost AML/CFT compliance. With the amount of money laundered globally ranging from 800 billion to 2 trillion US dollars each year, FinTech can definitely lend a helping hand.  Moving on to the challenges, what stands out is the potential impact of FinTech on the broader financial system.  By building novel consumer relationships, FinTech firms put pressure on the operative models of established financial institutions. To be more precise, nearly 90% of incumbents in Europe and Asia claim that at least part of their business models is at risk due to rising competition from innovators. This suggests that traditional players either have to change, or they risk losing market share – or even being completely pushed out of game.   
 Yet it is not only established financial institutions that need to change. The regulator community is facing a similar challenge. Without adapting our frameworks, we risk being sidelined and unable to meet expectations – especially when it comes to issues like ensuring financial stability. More and more regulators around the world – including within the 16+1 framework – seem to have realized this, tailoring their toolkits and choosing to facilitate rather than restrict innovations.  As we move towards more regulatory flexibility, we have to remain alert concerning the new risks stemming from FinTech. This has to do, first and foremost, with cyber security. Relying on novel technological solutions, such as cloud computing, certainly offers efficiency gains for financial entities. But it also creates additional headaches for regulators, as critical ICT infrastructure of the supervised institutions, as well as vast amounts of sensitive data are exposed to hacking and other forms of malware. Apart from this, it is essential to keep a close eye on the potential intensification of macrofinancial risks. While currently FinTech does not pose a direct threat to financial stability due to its limited overall size, the situation may change rapidly if left unchecked, especially given the rapid expansion of the sector. And a hidden build-up of risk is definitely not the outcome we as regulators would like to see.  FinTech developments have also lately attracted elevated attention from international financial institutions. Various risk mappings and assessments of the opportunities embedded in financial innovations have been carried out by the Financial Stability Board, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and other key bodies. Just last month the International Monetary Fund announced its FinTech Agenda, which will serve as the basis for deeper Fund’s involvement in the field – primarily in terms of coordinating a more coherent international approach towards FinTech and assisting member countries in constructing their domestic policy frameworks.  While the multilateral response is useful and creates ground for the spread of best-practices across borders, authorities must do their part domestically too – especially when bearing in mind that most international initiatives are still at an early stage. It is therefore up for each regulator to choose their own standpoint on FinTech. In this vein, I will briefly present the approach that we have adopted and been implementing at the Bank of Lithuania.  What we do is position ourselves not merely as a watchdog, but also as a supportive regulator. In practice, this attitude is reflected in formats such as the ‘Newcomer’ program, which is a one-stop shop for new market entrants, providing consultations and advice on establishment, licencing and related issues. We have also recently launched a regulatory ‘sandbox’, which aims to facilitate and encourage the development of innovative financial products. At the same time, it allows building know-how and constantly upgrading our regulatory and supervisory instruments.  We are also among the few countries that provides non-bank financial entities direct access to central bank payments infrastructure – what we call ‘CENTROlink’. For FinTechs, this eliminates the need for intermediaries, placing innovative firms that choose to enter the market on equal footing with the established players, thus boosting competition in the financial sector.  Going further, Lithuania boasts one of the quickest and most cost-competitive FinTech licencing regimes across Europe, coupled with a broad choice of business models – from e-money and payments institutions to specialized banks. 
 And what you get is not simply a Lithuanian licence – it gives you access to the whole Single Euro Payments Area. Despite the speed and flexibility of our licencing regime, we maintain the highest standards and a strict and responsible overall outlook when it comes to risks, especially in the AML/CFT field.  Lithuania’s favorable regulatory environment has been recognized internationally and allowed Lithuania to become one of main gateways for third country FinTechs to enter the European payments and banking markets. Entities with origins ranging from the US to Singapore have already used this gateway. A substantial part of third country firms choosing to enter the European market via Lithuania come from Asia and China in particular. In fact, several Chinese e-money and payments institutions have already established presence in our country, with more currently in the consultative phase. The amount of interest that we have been receiving lately indicates that there should be yet more to come in the near future. This is fueled partly by the ongoing Brexit process, which pushes UK firms to reallocate themselves to Europe if they wish to maintain their continental operations.  Aiming to further boost the standing of Lithuania as a FinTech hub, we are actively expanding our network of cooperation with foreign regulators. For instance, the Bank of Lithuania has signed FinTech cooperation agreement with the Monetary Authority of Singapore. We also have a supervisory agreement with the China Banking Regulatory Commission dating back to 2015 and we are currently in process of updating it to include FinTech and AML/CFT issues.  As for the 16+1 cooperation framework, I personally see this as a unique platform for deepening ties in the FinTech domain. It provides us with a setting that allows exchanging information, sharing the emerging best-practices, building mutual trust and facilitating day-to-day regulatory cooperation. Of course, these tasks are easier reached with dedicated formats. It is for this reason that Lithuania will be hosting a high-level 16+1 FinTech Forum next autumn, bringing policymakers together to consider practical ways of enhancing cooperation in the sector.  And that is not all. Next year Lithuania is planning to launch a 16+1 FinTech Coordination Centre. Operating in our capital city Vilnius, this centre will strive to involve decision makers, regulators, members of the academia, the civic society and industry representatives. Its key goal will be to facilitate continued dialogue and circulation of knowledge among the 16+1 countries regarding innovations in financial services. For instance, the centre could analyze the potential of the blockchain technology, application of artificial intelligence and big data solutions, as well as dealing with cyber security, consumer protection and operational risk management issues.  I sincerely hope that both formats – the high-level forum and the FinTech coordination centre – will attract substantial interest within this framework and that the interest will stem outside the regulator community. Instead of a conclusion, let me just say that I hope that in several years’ time, we will be able to look back and say that the topic of financial innovations is a true success story of the 16+1 cooperation, demonstrating the effectiveness and significance of this format.  Thank you.  
Nestor A Espenilla, Jr: Speaking throughSpeech by Mr Nestor A Espenilla, Jr, Governor of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP, the centralbank of the Philippines), delivered by Ms Maria Almasara Cyd N Tuano-Amador, Deputy Governorof Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, BSP Christmas Program, Manila, 12 December 2018.*   *   *Fellow members of the Monetary Board—Secretary Sonny Dominguez, MBM Philip Medalla,MBM Jun de Zuñiga, MBM Peter Favila, MBM Tony Abacan, and MBM Bruce Tolentino who iscelebrating his first Christmas here in the BSP.Our diligent and reliable Sector Heads– DG Diwa Guinigundo, DG Chuchi Fonacier, DG CydAmador, and Senior Assistant Governor Dahlia Luna.Family, friends, fellow BSPers, magandang hapon sa inyong lahat!This afternoon, I am so happy to be here amongst all of you. From the PICC entrance proceedingto where I am now sitting, along the way, I was able to greet those nearby to exchange smilesand nods even from afar I was able to acknowledge and let you know through simple gesturesthat I truly appreciate each of you.  I appreciate you individually, and collectively as part of thisgroup that comprises the BSP family. Team BSP.For several events now, I have, for health reasons, requested BSP Officers to deliver messageson my behalf. I have allowed others to speak for me and I have spoken through others.This is not an easy thing for me to do, as I am by heart, a speechwriter and am mindful of thepower of the podium. I must admit that allowing myself to speak through others can be a humbling experience as itreminds me of my own limitations.  But there are two things that also make it a very powerfulexercise.Allowing myself to speak through others emphasizes the value of giving them full and completetrust.  Designating others to give messages on my behalf is accompanied by completeconfidence that the Officers I have requested to do so will not only read from a sheet of paper.Rather, they do so, fully believing in the messages as well.  In so doing, they are not only echoingmy words, but are ambassadors and staunch advocates of the BSP’s best interests.When I took a two-week medical leave last September, it was with full confidence that the BSPwill continue even in my temporary absence, to work together to carry on with its many projectsand to fully implement and sustain the Continuity plus plus strategic agenda. I believe I left theBSP in very capable hands.  And so it was.  For this, let me express how profoundly thankful Iam, to you, my BSP family.Let me add too that I am glad to be celebrating my second Christmas with you as your Governor!The exercise of reposing full trust in the BSP’s officers and in each of you — reminds me that asevery person here works to fulfill the institution’s mandates of price stability, financial stability andan efficient payments and settlements system — each one becomes a spokesperson, anambassador and an advocate of our core values, of our strategic direction of continuity plusplus.  We speak through our work and commitment!This empowers me now and it empowers you.  I am buoyed by the palpable energy in this room.I contemplate this and am filled with joy as I celebrate the season with you all, and even with 1 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
those in the regions and branches through digital means. It is through our cooperative and collaborative efforts through the years and decades that wecelebrate our 25th Christmas at the BSP with a sterling reputation that remains untarnished.  Weare steadfast in our commitment to our mandates.For the past 25 years, through many trials, external disruptions, and challenges to our mandate,the BSP has provided economic stability. Along with other agencies of Government, we haveachieved for the Philippines, 79 consecutive quarters of uninterrupted GDP growth!To manage inflation expectations, and address possible second round effects of inflation, weproactively adjusted our monetary policy rates five times this year for a cumulative rate increaseof 175 basis points.  This is to help ensure that inflation reverts to within target range next year. And this is what we expect.We have not wavered in our commitment to price stability. Even as we deal with disruptions fromexternal and domestic factors affecting the supply side, we have put to good use the monetarytools at our disposal. We will continue to keep our ears to the ground, remain vigilant and prepareto face challenges ahead.Our banking system remains one of our strengths, continuing to strongly support economicgrowth.Our payments system has been growing steadily in scope, allowing for more efficient processingof financial transactions, spurring more economic activities and development.With all these, I can confidently say that the BSP through the years has firmly demonstrated itsstaunch commitment to its mandates—our three pillars of central banking. And I attribute this toour dynamic leaders AND TO YOU ALL, my dearest colleagues in the BSP (Applause).Earlier, I mentioned that allowing myself to speak through others is a powerful exercise. Aside from it being an avenue to demonstrate full trust in others.It is also powerful as it multipliesand amplifies the channels of communication.  For instance, as Cyd delivers this message,there are now two speakers heralding its points and reinforcing its value.Come to think of it, the Christmas season is one such event where our Lord himself speaksthrough another.  By sending His one and only Son to earth to deliver the message of Salvation,of Love, of Hope and Peace. His message has become the most powerful narrative of all.  It isspoken through the decades and generations.  It is attested to through transformed lives.For this reason, for the first Christmas, and for the wonderful opportunities it brings to gather andshare our blessings with others we are truly grateful.We thank the Lord for speaking through His Son and we keep in our hearts the message of hopeand salvation it brings. And let this be your take-away.Let me remind you then that to those whom much is given, much is expected. And in the spirit ofChristmas, I enjoin you to share these blessings with those we serve.  Let us allow love, hopeand peace to speak through us on a daily basis.Once again, on behalf of the Monetary Board and the BSP Management team, I wish everyone ameaningful Christmas and an abundant new year.From my family—my wife Tess, our children and our dear apo— sa buong BSP at sa inyong 2 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches

    Remarks by Ms Caroline Abel  Governor of the Central Bank of Seychelles   Launching of the CBS Strategic Plan 2019-2023  Monday 19 November 2018 Venue: Central Bank of Seychelles   Minister for Finance, Trade, Investment and Economic Planning, Ambassador Maurice Loustau – Lalanne, Board Members, Management and Staff of CBS Distinguished Guests Ladies and Gentlemen  Good afternoon.  It gives me great pleasure to welcome you all here today, to witness the launching of the new strategic plan of the Central Bank of Seychelles.  The 1st of December of this year will mark 40 years of the existence of a central banking institution in our island nation.  And today’s official launch of our new Strategic Plan for 2019 to 2023, highlights the progress made by the Bank, after standing decades of trials and triumphs.  
  We have indeed come a long way and witnessed significant evolution in the face of various challenges both locally and on the external front, while striving to remain true to our mandate, which is to contribute towards the sustainable economic growth and development of Seychelles through monetary policy and maintenance of a sound financial system.  Guided by a solid set of objectives, we have been able to discharge our responsibilities and make significant strides in achieving our vision. Over the past few years, the institution, backed by its workforce, has worked tirelessly to maintain domestic price and financial system stability, strengthen the payment systems, enhance financial consumer protection, promote greater engagement with external stakeholders and continuously engage in capacity building.  And as we stand here today, we can rightly be proud of our progress.  Nevertheless, we are not going to be complacent. We are now a more mature institution and we need to take on more responsibilities, if we are to continue improving. This responsibility rests on all of us, from our Board, Management, staff, our stakeholders - from both the public and private sector - and the public in general.  This is our third strategic plan and it builds on the successes of previous ones. The Strategic Plan 2019 to 2023 has been prepared so we can enhance achievements made thus far and to continue focusing on achieving our mandated goals and objectives.  The global economy is ever changing and we have to take a proactive stance, if we are to keep in pace with the developments. We need to ensure that our 
  monetary policy implementations are effective, that we keep abreast with innovation, including the continuous modernization of our payment systems, and equally important is to ensure our population is empowered to make informed and sound financial decisions.  Planning for the future, although time-consuming, is vital to ensuring that our work will bring ongoing benefits not only for our organization, but for the country as a whole.  The strategic planning process has actively sought the input of everyone across the Central Bank, cognizant of the fact that an effective consultation process establishes the solid foundation for the success of the plan over the coming years. We went through a bottom-up planning process, engaging in discussions with all staff of each division and unit to formulate departmental plans. The Board then joined the Management team to set expectations and provide guidance on the formulation of this important document.  I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the team involved in the consultations, discussions and drafting of the plan, who have ensured that we have a document that serves as a roadmap that will guide our endeavours over the next five years.   On this note, I would like to also thank and convey my appreciation to Board Director, Professor William Ogara, and the Second Deputy Governor, Ms Jenifer Sullivan, for spearheading the process, ever since we embarked on the strategic review exercise over a year ago.  
  As Governor of the Central Bank, I look forward to the ongoing commitment and professionalism of all staff to continue upholding the credibility of our institution and to achieve the strategic objectives set out in the plan. I also look forward to building on the good collaboration that we have with all our stakeholders represented here today, in taking this plan forward.  On this note, I am pleased to announce the official launch of the Strategic Plan 2019 – 2023 of the Central Bank of Seychelles.  Thank You. 
          AN ADDRESS BY    GOVERNOR GODWIN I. EMEFIELE, CON      AT THE 2018 ANNUAL BANKERS’ DINNER CONTINENTAL HOTEL, VICTORIA ISLAND LAGOS     30 NOVEMBER 2018 CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA  
 2  Gov. Godwin Emefiele, CON Address at the 2018 Annual Bankers’ Dinner  Lagos, 30 November 2018 _______________________________  Opening Pleasantries— Good evening distinguished ladies and gentlemen. It is indeed a pleasure to be with you this evening, and to use this occasion to step back from the day-to-day concerns of inflation, external reserves and exchange rate, to consider a number of the deep-seated, long term factors shaping Nigeria’s economy. I am also delighted at the opportunity to once again address a gathering of eminent personalities, which includes critical stakeholders in our nation’s financial sector, as well as members of the Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria.   2. Before I go any further with my address, please permit me,  to specially thank the leadership of the 
 3 Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria ; particularly  Dr Uche Olowu, Mr Seye Awojobi and their team, for their relentless efforts to ensure the success of today’s event. I want to also extend my profound gratitude to the Managing Directors/Chief Executive Officers of our banks and other financial institutions who have found time to be here despite their very busy schedules.  3. I must not forget to accord honour to whom it is due.  Permit me, ladies and gentlemen, to congratulate Dr Uche Olowu on his well-deserved election as the President and Chairman of the Governing Council of this great institute. I also wish to thank the immediate past President, Prof. Segun Ajibola and the outgoing Council members for their outstanding performance, and total commitment to the pursuit of the vision and mission of the institute. I sincerely thank each and every one of you for your respective roles in making this institute one of the leading professional bodies in the country.  
 4 4. Likewise, I welcome my colleagues from the CBN, especially the Deputy Governors, Departmental Directors, Special Advisers, Special Assistants, and other senior management of the Bank who are here present. And to everyone here seated I say: thank you for coming. 5. When I addressed this gathering five years ago, I acknowledged that a night such as this should not be dominated by excessive speeches. It should be a time to dine, merry and unwind after a hectic year. Though I am mindful of the need to allow you relax and enjoy the conviviality, it will be a great disservice to you and to our dear nation if I failed to adequately draw your attention to key economic and financial developments, both historical and expected.   6. Distinguished ladies and gentlemen, my address this evening is focused on “Strengthening the 
 5 Economic Recovery Process in Nigeria”. I am pleased to have this opportunity to share my perspective on some of the key issues that the Nigerian economy has faced over the past 3 years, which includes the factors that led to the economic recession in the 1st quarter of 2016, and the measures we took at the Bank along with the Fiscal authorities to support our recovery from the recession by the 2nd quarter of 2017.  7. In my inaugural address to Nigerians after assuming office as the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria in June 2014, I indicated that my mandate would be to ensure that the Central Bank of Nigeria is more people focused, as its policies and programs would be geared towards supporting job creation and fostering inclusive growth, in addition to key macroeconomic concerns such as inflation and exchange rate stability. This idea of a people focused central bank is more relevant today, given the global headwinds we face as a 
 6 nation and the Central Bank of Nigeria remains committed to supporting measures that would wean the nation from its dependence on imported goods; your Central Bank today is more committed to creating wealth and putting in place strong policies for creating jobs for our growing youth population; your Central Bank today  is ever more committed to promoting a more stable and resilient financial system.   8. Several economic and financial experts continually attempt to analyse and pre-empt the policy actions of the CBN. To the extent that these endeavours are based on rational expectations, we wholly welcome the effort. Notably, some of their conclusions are incongruent to ours. As I have always maintained, I am not surprised at this outcome since most of those analysts, unfortunately, rely on limited or utterly incorrect information. Let me reiterate that the CBN will 
 7 always act in good faith, with the best available information and in cognizance of current economic conditions, to pursue price and financial system stability, support job creation on a massive scale and ensure a more inclusive growth in the economy. After a wave of scathing criticism that trailed some of our past policies, many of these measures are today being widely applauded as brilliant and conscientious actions. As policymakers, our perspectives are typically different from many talking heads, as our data, information sources and outlook remain superior. I therefore enjoin our critics to avoid being hasty in their condemnation of our policies. Some policies take time to bear fruit. 9. Let me at this point briefly explain the macroeconomic and geopolitical contexts in which the Central Bank and the nation have been operating.  
 8 A Quick Overview 10. On the global scene, a number of recent developments have noticeably impacted outcomes and outlooks especially in emerging market economies including Nigerian. These include: i. Rising global interest rate due to sustained tightening stance in advanced economies which consequently and unfortunately heightened fragilities, imbalances and vulnerabilities in emerging markets. The Fed fund rate was raised steadily to 2.25 percent in September 2018 with a promise for one more hike before the end of 2018 and three more in 2019. Similarly, the Bank of England raised its policy rate in August 2018 for the first time since 2008. Some emerging markets economies, including India, Indonesia, Mexico and Turkey have also raised interest rates in response to that shock; ii. The consequent huge capital flow reversals in emerging markets that led to immense pressures 
 9 on exchange rates, FX reserves, and sharp losses in the capital markets. Argentina, Brazil, South Africa, Turkey and Russia have already depreciated their currencies significantly due to this shock; iii. Uneven fluctuations in the international prices of commodities including crude oil, gold, cocoa, etc. After hitting $86 per barrel in October 2018, oil prices have dropped by over 30% as at November 25, 2018;   iv. Profound geopolitical and trade tensions (including between US and China, US and Iran, Russia and Western economies etc.) which are impacting the dynamics of global trade and consequently the flow of capital;  v. The rising incidence of protectionism, nationalism, and anti-globalization especially in the western hemisphere; and vi. Uneven growth of the global economy accompanied by a tepid short-term outlook.  
 10  11. What are the likely implications of these issues on Nigeria? And what steps can we take to avoid a repeat of the economic slowdown that occurred between 2016 and 2017? Given the structure of our economy, CBN’s attention is primary focused on three factors, including;  • One, rising trade tensions between the US and China could taper global growth, and by extension demand for commodities such as crude oil •  Second, how to ensure that Nigeria’s economy is insulated from the adverse consequences facing emerging and frontier markets, due to rising rates in the United States. •  Third, what is the likely impact on the crude oil market from the sharp rise in US oil production, which currently stands at 11.7m barrels per day and is likely to rise to over 14m barrels in 2 years? 
 11 12. As you may recall, Nigeria’s political-economy experienced significant challenges over the last few years revealing its structural deficiencies particularly with regards to its dependence on crude oil, as a major source of its revenue and foreign exchange, as well as over dependence of our people on imported items even when these goods could be produced locally. The 60 percent decline in crude oil prices between 2015 and 2016 helped shape the trajectory of our economy, ultimately triggering the economic recession in Q1 of 2016.   Road to Recovery 13. The country’s overdependence on crude oil for FX revenue meant that shocks in the oil market were transmitted entirely to the economy via the FX markets as manufacturers and traders who required forex to purchase their inputs as well as goods, were faced with a depleting supply of 
 12 foreign exchange in the country. The impact of this decline on our reserves was evident in the rise in the value of the US Dollar relative to the Naira; and a rise in the Consumer Price Index due to the increase in the cost of imported inputs and goods. In a bid to contain rising inflation and to cushion the impact of the drop in FX supply on the Nigerian economy, the Bank took three bold steps; 14. First, The CBN tightened money supply in order contain inflation while improving yields in local bonds, which attracted the attention of foreign investors. Second, we analyzed our import bill and encouraged manufacturers to consider local options in sourcing their raw materials, by restricting access to foreign exchange on 41 items. Third, the Investors and Exporters FX(I&E) window was introduced, which allowed investors and exporters to purchase and sell foreign exchange at the prevailing market rate. 
 13  15. The impact of these three measures led to an increase in foreign exchange inflows into the country; Transactions in the I&E FX window reached $24 billion ($6 billion net inflows) in 2017 and Nigeria’s foreign exchange reserves rose to over $48billion at the end of May 2018 from $23bn in October 2016 Foreign Exchange Reserves ($billion)   16.  With improved availability of foreign exchange, the exchange rate at the I&E FX window has remained stable over the past 12 months and the parallel market exchange rate premium has narrowed significantly. At the BDC segment, we saw a  20.0 27.5 35.0 42.5 50.0Jan-16Jul-16Jan-17Jul-17Jan-18Jul-18Jan-19Jul-19Jan-20Jul-20Jan-21Jul-21Jan-22Jul-22
 14 significant appreciation of the Naira from over NGN525/US$ in February 2017 to about NGN361/US$ today. Rates at the I&E window also appreciated from nearly NGN382/US$ in May 2017 to just over NGN360/US$.  NGN – USD Convergence Across the Various Markets   17. GDP: After five quarters of uninterrupted GDP contraction (beginning from 1st Quarter of 2016), the economy exited from the recession during the second quarter of 2017. The recovery has been 300.325.350.375.400.27/11/2007/03/2115/06/2123/09/2101/01/2211/04/2220/07/2228/10/22NGN SpotNAFX IndexNIFX Index6m NDF
 15 sustained for five consecutive quarters. Though the pace of GDP growth slowed from 1.95 percent in the first quarter of 2018 to 1.50 percent in the second quarter, short-term outlook continued to strengthen with average growth projections of about 1.9 percent for 2018    18. The measures taken by the CBN also had an impact on inflation. Following a period of rising inflationary pressure which peaked at 18.7 percent in January 2017, the Nigerian economy witnessed -2.50-1.000.502.003.50Q32015Q42015Q12016Q22016Q32016Q42016Q12017Q22017Q32017Q42017Q12018Q22018Quarterly Growth in GDP Y-on-Y
 16 eighteen straight months of disinflation, as inflation dropped to 11.1 percent in July 2018. A slight uptick to 11.25 percent was, however, recorded in October 2018 due to rising food prices.   19. Activities in the manufacturing sector also witnessed significant improvement between August 2016 and August 2018, as the Primary Manufacturing Index rose from a low of 42% in August 2016 to 57% in August 2018. This development was attributed to sustained supply of foreign exchange and stability of the naira. 5.0010.0015.0020.00Jan-17May-17Sep-17Jan-18May-18Sep-18Inflation Year-on-YearInflationMPR
 17  20. We were also aware that in order to ensure sustainable growth, efforts must be made to address factors that constrained the growth of businesses in Nigeria. This led to the set-up of the enabling business committee PEBEC, chaired by His Excellency the Vice President. PEBEC was mandated to unlock bureaucratic constraints to doing business in Nigeria. The CBN and PEBEC worked together to improve access to credit for underserved Nigerians, through the set-up of a National Collateral Registry and the passage of the Credit Bureau Act. As a result of these initiatives in addition to other reforms, Nigeria moved up by 24 points in the World Bank’s 2017 Doing Business Rankings. (145 from 167 in 2016)    
 18 Key Takeaways 21. The ongoing global tensions as well as the economic recession in 2016 provided us with some key lessons on some of the steps we need to take if we intend to improve the wealth base of the nation. Our understanding of the nature of Nigeria’s domestic imbalances indicates that two key factors accentuated our vulnerability to global shocks. The first is the diminished total factor productivity in Nigeria due to a low and inadequate infrastructural base. The second is our overdependence on imports for both capital goods and domestic consumption.  22. With regards to the inadequate infrastructural base, I am aware of ongoing efforts being made by the fiscal authorities in constructing critical roads networks such as the 2nd Niger Bridge, Lagos – Ibadan Highway, Abuja – Kano road network, and the rail lines between Port-Harcourt -  Maiduguri, 
 19 Itakpe - Ajaokuta and  Lagos – Kano. These measures will go a long way in reducing the logistics cost of doing business in Nigeria, while opening up new markets for farmers, traders and manufacturers. 23.  With regards to our overdependence of imports, the economic recession triggered mainly by the drop in crude oil prices, only strengthened the case for the need to move from a nation wholly dependent on consumption, to a nation that produces a large proportion of what it needs, particularly in areas where the resources or inputs needed for production are widely available across the country. This thought process shaped our decision to impose the restriction on access to forex for 41 items that can be produced in Nigeria.  24. There has been considerable discourse particularly on whether the restriction on access to foreign exchange for 41 items is driving local 
 20 production, with some nay-sayers stating that it has constrained productivity and growth in the economy. Based on our internal research conducted at the Central Bank of Nigeria, there is strong support that the recovery of our economy from the recession may have been much weaker or even negative, without the implementation of the restriction on 41 items. Our research supports the conclusion that the combination of the restriction on 41 items along with other measures imposed by the fiscal and monetary authorities has helped to promote the recovery. Any attempt to reverse the course of this actions may have untold consequences on the growth trajectory of our economy particularly in our push to diversify and restructure our economy. In fact, recommendations are being made to the CBN that the list of 41 items be expanded to include other additional items that can be locally produced.  
 21 25. Second, many entrepreneurs are taking advantage of this policy to venture into the domestic production of the restricted items with remarkable successes and great positive impact on employment. The dramatic decline in our import bill and the increase in domestic production of these items attest to the efficacy of this policy. Noticeable declines were steadily recorded in our monthly food import bill from US$665.4 million in January 2015 to US$160.4 million as at October 2018; a cumulative fall of 75.9 percent and an implied savings of over US$21 billion on food imports alone over that period. Most evident were the 97.3 percent cumulative reduction in monthly rice import bills, 99.6 percent in fish, 81.3 percent in milk, 63.7 percent in sugar, and 60.5 percent in wheat. We are glad with the accomplishments recorded so far. Accordingly, this policy is expected to continue with vigor until the underlying imbalances within the Nigerian economy have been fully resolved; 
 22  26. Development finance: In continued recognition of our role as an agent of development and aimed at ensuring self-sufficiency to reduce Nigeria’s excessive dependence on imports, the CBN invigorated its development finance activities. We have maintained a particular focus on supporting farmers, entrepreneurs as well as small and medium scale businesses, through our various intervention programs such as the Anchor Borrowers Program, Nigeria Incentive-Based Risk Sharing System for Agricultural Lending (NIRSAL) and the National Collateral Registry. The CBN recently introduced the Real Sector Support fund; a facility meant to provide cheap funding at no more than 9 percent to new projects in the Agric and Manufacturing sectors; aimed at boosting output and creating jobs.   
 23 27. In the agriculture sector, the Anchor Borrower Programme (ABP) has ensured that Nigeria emerged from being a net importer of rice to becoming a major producer of rice, supplying key markets in neighboring countries. As at October 2018, a total number of 862,069 farmers cultivating about 835,239 hectares, across 16 different commodities, have so far benefited from the Anchor Borrowers programme, which has generated 2,502,675 jobs across the country.

It is in light of the success of the Anchor Borrowers Program with regards to cultivation of rice and maize that the Monetary Policy Committee in its last meeting on the 21st of November 2018 recommended that the Anchor Borrowers program be applied to other areas such as palm oil, tomatoes and fisheries to mention a few.  29. Our efforts at supporting small scale farmers and SMEs is based on our awareness of the critical role they can play in supporting our economic recovery and growth, as well as in creating job opportunities for millions of Nigerians.  So far, the CBN has through its MSME fund disbursed over N100Billion to the MSME sector, but we still feel a lot can be done. Under the auspices of the Bankers Committee, the sum of over N60 billion has so far been set aside under the AGSMIES fund to fund Micro Small and Medium enterprise businesses in 
 25 the Agriculture and Manufacturing sectors of our economy. The CBN recognizes that the greatest challenge confronting MSME’s and local farmers is access to credit, and that to unlock the growth potentials in our country; these groups must access funding seamlessly. In response to this challenge, the CBN will in due course take action that will directly bring Banking services to the rural communities through the licensing of a national Micro Finance Bank, which will have a presence in all local governments in Nigeria, thereby supporting the channeling of credit to our rural communities. We will continue to explore ways, in partnering with the fiscal authorities, on how we can best provide farmers and SMES with the support they need to expand their operations.   30. The other day when I visited an unnamed popular supermarket in Lagos, there was a big contrast between my visit to the shop 5 years ago, and my 
 26 visit in November. What was apparent was the huge increase in the number of made in Nigerian processed goods that were being sold in this store; From locally produced rice to well packaged ready to use tomato stew, dried fruits and also cassava chips. As I walked round the shop I could see the huge potential of Nigerian entrepreneurs, as they developed products which could compete with their peers in other climes. I could also imagine the number of people who are being employed by these entrepreneurs to support production of these goods. For us to grow as a nation, we must continue to encourage these businesses as they do more than just provide goods, they help to sustain the vitality of the communities in which they live and work. 31. Financial Inclusion – Cognizant of the fact that close to 40% of adult Nigerians do not have access to financial services, the bank implemented a series of steps that will help drive our efforts aimed 
 27 at building a more financially inclusive society. Some of these measures include the Agent Banking Guidelines and the Shared Agent Network Facility (SANEF), both of which are intended to deepen penetration of agent networks in underserved locations across the country. The recent launch of the policy on Payment Service Banks in October 2018, is an additional step aimed at leveraging on the distribution networks of non-bank entities, such as Fast-Moving Consumer Goods companies, Fintechs, and Mobile Network Operators, in providing financial services to under-served communities. With these schemes in place, we believe that over the next 2 years, over 80% of Nigerians will have access to financial services.   32. Credit Allocation: As part of its long-term strategy for strengthening the Nigerian economy, the Bank established initiatives to resolve the underlying challenges to long-term GDP growth, economic 
 28 productivity, unemployment and poverty that had pervaded the economy over the past decades. Hence, the CBN established the Credit Bureau and the National Collateral Registry to improve access to credit in the domestic economy. We believe these measures will help to instil a stronger credit culture and unlock access to finance for deserving Nigerians, including those who may not have fixed assets to provide to banks as collateral.   33. Furthermore, to spur bank lending to high-impact sector, the Bank, at its July 2018 MPC, pledged to refund CRR to banks under certain conditions. Banks that bring proposal for funding of new projects or expansion of existing ones in agriculture and manufacturing sectors will, accordingly, qualify for CRR refund of up to 100 percent. It is our expectation that banks would use this opportunity to expand credits to the real sector.   
 29 34. Risk Based Supervision: The recent weakening of the Naira, following the shift to a more flexible foreign exchange mechanism, impacted somewhat on the balance sheets of domestic banks. To guarantee financial stability as Nigeria continues with flexible exchange rate system, the CBN took a number of steps, including:  o Monitoring compliance of supervised institutions with the foreign exchange management framework issued in June 2016 through our risk-based supervision methodology, which also involved reviewing international trade and foreign exchange operations of local banks;  o Monitoring the financial position and performance of supervised institutions; o Assessment of the risk profile and governance management practices of banks o In the event of major deteriorations on any key risk indicator, we engaged with the affected bank in 
 30 order to mitigate concerns and shore-up their capital base.  35. As I have always emphasized, it is our collective duty to ensure that the potentials and prospects of the Nigerian economy is optimally realized. The ongoing economic recovery requires the joint efforts and wise counsel of everyone seated here, if we must make giant strides forward. The CBN is more determined now than ever to remain at the forefront of the effort to ensure that the rebound is not overturned.   Peer Review of Emerging Market Economies 36. Ladies and gentlemen, in assessing Nigeria’s recovery efforts and performance, it is essential to conduct a comparative assessment of our peers. Strikingly, it will be discovered that Nigeria did not fare badly vis-à-vis other emerging market 
 31 economies like Brazil, South Africa, Turkey, and Argentina, that had similar economic experiences.  37. Amidst the growing challenges, Nigeria has managed to keep real GDP growth positive and has avoided a double-dip recession in contrast to some other emerging markets economies.  38. In comparison and following its 2016 contractions, the South African economy recorded a double-dip recession with renewed contractions of 2.6 and 0.7 percent in the first and second quarters of 2018, respectively. In Argentina, though the economy was in recession throughout 2016, moderate upticks which peaked at 1.9 percent quarter two of 2017 ended that recession. However, the Argentinian economy shrank by 4.0 per cent in quarter two of 2018, bringing the country to the brink of another recession.  
 32 39. The Brazilian economy had been in recession since 2015 and only emerged from it the first quarter of 2017 with a growth rate of 1.0 percent. Since then the growth has slowed progressively until the last quarter of 2017 when growth remained flat. However, the economy is gradually rebounding and has recorded 0.1 and 0.2 percentage growth rates in the first and second quarters of 2018.   40. Given rising yields in advanced markets, capital outflows from emerging markets have increased tremendously. This has led to substantial exchange market pressures in many emerging markets with FX reserves falling about 25.2 percent in Argentina, 9.6 percent in Turkey, and 2.1 percent in South Africa since the beginning of the year. Also, significant currency depreciation was recorded in Argentina (by 101 percent), Turkey (43 percent), Brazil (19 percent), Russia (19 percent) 
 33 and India (16 percent); even as the naira remained stable.(-.006%)    41. As a matter of fact, a recent Bloomberg data on financial market performances shows that Nigeria bond market remains one of the most attractive investment destinations -In the Bloomberg’s Emerging-Market Local-Currency Government Bonds index, which covers major emerging markets  such as Nigeria, South Africa, Argentina, China, and Russia, in the 2nd Quarter of 2018, Nigerian local bonds topped the chart with an -125%-100%-75%-50%-25%0%ArgentinaTurkeyBrazilIndiaIndonesiaRussiaNigeriaCurrency against the US Dollar (2018)
 34 average total return of 3.2%  in dollar returns(The index covers Nigerian Government Bonds with maturities from 2019 to 2037) . The total return is a combination of the price changes in the bonds over the 2nd Quarter of 2018, the interest returns and the changes in the currency.    42. Nigeria's dominance over this period was due to the stability of the I&E FX rate and the yields being high by emerging-market standards. Investors are also sure that they can exit their positions if they want, which has been crucial in driving other investors into the market.   
 35  Outlook and Policy Thrust for 2019 43. Global growth projections both for 2018 and 2019 have been revised downward to 3.7 percent from the 3.9 percent earlier projected. Growth momentum in US is projected to remain strong as fiscal stimulus continues into 2019. In emerging markets, growth forecasts are revised downward for Argentina, Brazil, Iran, Turkey, and South Africa reflecting country-specific factors, uncertainties in the financial conditions, and rising geopolitical tensions as well as higher oil import bills.  44. In light of the current developments in both the global and domestic economies, and based on extensive simulations, the CBN is of the view that the short-term outlook of the Nigerian economy remains good. We expect that: • Monetary policy stance will remain judicious, research driven, adequate and supportive of the real 
 36 economy subject to underlying fundamentals. The current tight stance is expected to continue in the near-term, especially in view of rising inflation expectations and exchange market pressures. Though we will act to appropriately adjust the policy rate in line with unfolding conditions and outlooks, the CBN will continue to ensure that the policy interest rate is delicately set to balance the objectives of price stability with output stabilization; • GDP: With favorable oil price developments and continued efforts at driving indigenous production in high-impact real sector activities, especially agriculture and manufacturing, GDP is expected to pick-up in the remaining two quarters of 2018. This will be buoyed by the anticipated budgetary and electioneering spending in the near-term. From 1.5 percent in quarter two of 2018, growth is projected to quicken to 1.7 percent in quarter three and 1.9 by the fourth quarter; 
 37 • Inflation: Inflation expectations are rising on the backdrop of anticipated politically-related liquidity injections. For the rest of 2018 and towards mid-2019 Nigeria’s rate of inflation is projected to rise slightly to about 11.4 percent and then moderate thereafter; • Exchange Rate: Though the CBN has so far managed to maintain exchange rate stability, the current capital flow reversals from emerging markets is expected to continue to exert considerable pressure on market rates. This pressure could be amplified by the forthcoming elections, especially as the political market place heats up. Notwithstanding these pressures, the CBN is determined to maintain its stable exchange policy stance over the next few months given the relatively high level of reserves. Gross stability is projected in the FX market given increased oil related inflows and contained import bill. I will like to make it categorically clear that 
 38 “sustaining a stable exchange rate is of overriding importance to us even as we continue to put measures in place to shore up reserves”; • BOP: Overall our balance of payments is expected to remain positive in the short-term. Hoping that oil prices continued to recover, we expect the Current Account Balance to strengthen even further. This will be supported by improved non-oil performance as diversification efforts begin to yield results to reduce undue imports.  • Supporting Domestic Production: Given the remarkable success that has been achieved in stimulating domestic production of goods such as rice, cassava and maize, as a result of the restrictions placed by the CBN on access to forex  for 41 items,  the CBN intends to vigorously ensure that this policy remains in place, and additional efforts would be made to block any attempts by unscrupulous parties(both individuals and 
 39 corporates) that intend to find other avenues of accessing forex, in order to import these items into Nigeria. The CBN’s Economic intelligence and Banking Supervision Departments will work very hard with the EFCC to expose and sanction any, bank, company or Fx operator that colludes with unscrupulous individuals / companies to undermine the policy on 41 items. Such sanctions will include, but not limited to prohibiting the banks from maintaining any bank accounts for such institutions or persons in Nigeria.  Given the global and domestic headwinds we face as a nation, and the volatility that is being experienced in the crude oil market, we have no other option, as leaders interested in the progress of our nation, but to work very hard to spur job creation by reviving agricultural and industrial activities in the country. If we continue to support the growth of small holders farmers, as well as help to revive palm oil refineries, rice mills,  cassava and tomato processing 
 40 factories, you can only imagine the amount of wealth and jobs that will be created in the country; These could include new set of small holders farmers that will be engaged in productive activities; new logistics companies that will transport raw materials to factories, and finished goods to the market; new storage centres that will be built to store locally produced goods; additional growth for our banks and financial institutions as they will be able to provide financial services to support these new businesses; and finally, the millions of Nigerians that will be employed in factories to support processing of goods. If we turn a blind eye to the opportunities that are being created as a result of our policy on 41 items, we will be spelling doom for our nation. We can no longer afford to depend solely on imports given the size of our population, and the need to create jobs for our people. This is precisely the purpose behind our intention to restrict access to forex on 41 items, and I urge all stakeholders to 
 41 come onboard, as we intend to be vigorous in our pursuit of this objective. • Domestic Credit: The Bank will explore the possibility of leveraging technology to enhance credit to critical sectors of the economy, especially, agriculture and manufacturing. Our recently announced policy to refund portions of CRR to banks that are financing new projects (or expanding existing ones) in agriculture and manufacturing sectors will be intensified and enriched in the coming years. This, we believe, will bolster job creation while supporting our agenda to correct Nigeria’s imbalances and vulnerabilities. • Open to Foreign Investors: As the monetary and fiscal authorities continue to work tirelessly to support the recovery of our economy, it is important to acknowledge some of Nigeria’s enduring strengths, which offer significant rewards for current and prospective foreign investors. Notwithstanding 
 42 the impact of the recession, Nigeria’s economy remains the largest in Africa by the size of its GDP, with a very well diversified mix of opportunities across different sectors, such as ICT, Manufacturing, Solid Minerals, Trade and Agriculture. The Central Bank and indeed the Federal Government is open to foreign investors who are keen to support our efforts at unlocking the immense opportunities in our economy, knowing that it offers mutual gains to both the investors and the nation. Investors can be assured that their investments in Nigeria would be duly protected by the authorities, as we are fully aware of the various advantages they can provide to our economy in terms of capital and technological know-how. We hereby reaffirm our commitment to investors that Nigeria is indeed open for business. Conclusion 45. Distinguished ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to conclude my remarks today with the story of a 
 43 revered Mongolian warrior named Genghis Khan, who had a falcon that is exceptionally well-trained for hunting. The falcon would usually sit meekly on the warrior’s arm and would do everything that the warrior commands —even when no words were spoken. Khan loved this falcon and boasted lavishly about the bird’s loyalty. It could see things from the skies that humans could not.  46. On a certain day, however, the warrior and his entourage embarked on a hunt. Despite the group’s best efforts, they found nothing. They had stayed in the forest longer than expected, and an irate Khan was now desperately tired and thirsty. Then, to his delight, he saw a thread of water flowing from a rock just in front of him. He took out a cup to fill and drink. Just as he was about to raise it to his lips, the falcon plucked the cup from his hands and spilled it. Once again, he filled the cup and the falcon spilled it a second time. Khan, now enraged by the intolerable disrespect, drew his 
 44 sword, and for a third time refilled his cup. As the falcon again took flight towards him, Khan, with one thrust, killed it.   47. The trickling thread of water had, however, dried up by that time. When Khan climbed the rock in search of more water he saw that one of the most poisonous snakes lay dead in the pool. If he had drunk the water, he, too, would have died. It was only then that Khan realized that the falcon’s actions had saved his life. Having impetuously and impatiently killed a genuinely loyal ally, a distraught and abjectly regretful Khan returned to camp with the dead falcon in his arms. He ordered a gold figurine of the bird to be fabricated with touching words engraved unto its wings. But, it was too late; the falcon was dead. The damage is irreversible. A loyal and genuinely caring bird has been impatiently slayed.  
 45 48. Ladies and gentlemen, this story culled from Paulo Coelho’s book titled “Like the Flowing River” underscores the folly of intolerance and impatience especially when we hastily judge certain actions or policies as unfavorable in the near-term without due consideration for their long-run merits. As I have reiterated in my earlier addresses to you, policymaking and leadership is not a popularity context. Many of us in this room understand that, as leaders, we have to take seemingly unpopular decisions every now and again for the best outcomes.        Like the falcon, you must note that policymakers usually have a panoramic view of events given the enormous array of information and data at their disposal; some of which could be considered classified. Again, like the falcon, we are dogmatically willing to stick-out our necks for what is right even if that would earn us instant and, sometimes, irreversible condemnation; or even our heads. Like the falcon, we 
 46 must be bold to do what is right at all times regardless of whether we will be harshly castigated for those actions.  Once again, I call on all of us, this evening, to set aside our complaints, differences and distractions, and let us work together to create a Nigeria, where balanced growth and shared prosperity is guaranteed for all. As I leave you to digest the moral of that story, ladies and gentlemen, let me take my seat and start digesting my meal for the evening!    49. I thank you very much for your attention. And thank you once again, for being here today.  GODWIN I. EMEFIELE, CON Governor, Central Bank of Nigeria  30 November 2018 
Gent Sejko: The importance of media in analysing Albania’smonetary policyAddress by Mr Gent Sejko, Governor of the Bank of Albania, at the end-of-year meeting with themedia, Tirana, 20 December 2018.*   *   *Dear ladies and gentlemen,Welcome to our end-of-year meeting with the media.  I would like to thank you for your readiness,objectivity, and seriousness in covering the activities of the Bank of Albania and informing thepublic about them, throughout 2018. Thanks to you, our analyses and decision-making havebeen communicated in a thorough manner, mindfully tailored and styled in accordance with theage and profession of the targeted audience. I must note that, in addition to broad geographic coverage, your comments and analyses on theeconomic and financial developments in Albania have been very professional. At the Bank ofAlbania, my colleagues and I maintain that the current media reality is an important part of ouractivity. Our decision-making could not be considered complete without your contribution.Communication is a vital and delicate process for a central bank. I must emphasize that, withoutyour help and objectivity, realisation of Bank of Albania’s decision-making regarding monetarypolicy and financial stability would have been an impossible mission.Figuratively, I would point out that you are the ones that enable the translation of our analyses andconclusions into an adequate and easy-to-understand message for the general public. You haveinformed the public on our actions and interventions related to monetary policy, as well as on ourdecisions related to financial stability, market efficiency, banking regulations and other morespecific aspects.This leads us to the conclusion that the level of reporting has improved significantly, which, inturn, urges us to be more demanding of ourselves in all the arguments and analysesunderpinning our decision-making. I would like to thank you for your constructive role in reportingnews items related to developments in the economy, finances, money, the banking system,inflation, financial stability, as well as to the risks towards which our economy is exposed.I would also like to assure you that the Bank of Albania will continue to be an open and very loyalinstitution vis-à-vis the media. The Bank of Albania will be continuously open to communicationwith regard to the entire spectrum of economic, financial, contemporary, professional andunbiased news.Dear ladies and gentlemen,It has become a tradition now for us to organise, during the end-of-year meeting with the media,a modest but very meaningful ceremony: the awards ceremony for the best diploma thesis. Wevalue true scientific research in its highly beneficial capacity, from a long-term perspective, toenable the building of contemporary and sustainable research models.From this point of view, the Bank of Albania has endeavoured to boost its research capacities,something we consider to be essential, ultimately helping to perfect our entire decision-makingprocess related to monetary policy and financial stability. For this very reason, the awardceremony for the best diploma thesis has become a consolidated activity of the Bank of Albaniageared toward supporting promising students in the field of scientific research within the scope ofcentral banking.This year, students also showed a high interest in presenting their diploma theses. We received 1 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
27 studies on a wide range of economic, financial, and legal topics focused mostly on theAlbanian economy. It is a delight to see how these studies use contemporary researchmethodologies and valuable information intelligently to analyse economic phenomena, employingtheoretical and empirical arguments. In spite of the challenge of choosing the most interestingstudies, we now have our verdict on the “Governor’s Award for the Best Diploma Thesis 2018”.The selection has not been easy. Each year, we receive increasingly more qualitative studies interms of research methodology, topic originality and methods applied in research.I take this opportunity to congratulate all the contestants for the high quality of the presentedstudies. I hope and encourage you to further enrich your theoretical and empirical capacities asyou advance in your careers, wherever that may lead, in academia or as experts in specificfields. I hope you will be unremittingly engaged in scientific research, in a relationship of whichonly the starting date is known.Thank you and happy holidays! 2 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
1          Joint ICMIF/AMICE Regulatory Affairs conference  Paris, Tuesday 4 December 2018     Keynote address  Denis Beau – First Deputy Governor     “Old and new challenges for the insurance sector, its regulators  and supervisors”                    
2  Good morning to all of you, dear Presidents and members of ICMIF and AMICE,  I am very happy to be here with you today to exchange views on the stimulating and no less challenging developments that the insurance sector, and especially mutual insurers, as well as their regulators and supervisors, will have to face in the upcoming months and years.  After a few words on the economic and financial context and its related challenges for insurers, I will first focus on those brought by regulatory developments currently in the making, and will finish with the new risks that insurers, their regulators and supervisors will have to address, namely cyber-risks and climate change-related risks.  Overall, the macroeconomic environment has been favourable. The recovery of the global economy strengthened last year. Global GDP grew at 3.8% in 2017 and is expected to grow at a similar pace for the next two years. The European economy performed well and the inflation rate in Europe is in line with the European Central Bank’s target (2%). Even if recent survey data have been somewhat weaker, the medium-term outlook for the euro area remains broadly positive.   However, global and domestic uncertainties are growing. The tightening  of monetary policy in response to improved economic conditions may impact the growth of major advanced economies. The US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England have progressively raised interest rates; meanwhile, the European Central Bank has started phasing out its bond-buying programme (QE). The impact of monetary policy normalisation on financial markets should be closely monitored. The overall market sentiment is optimistic, but signs of possible repricing in financial markets are emerging. Market volatility has increased since the beginning of the year and price corrections were observed, most significantly in equity markets. Valuations remain stretched in equity, bond and certain real estate markets creating a high risk of asset repricing. Recent tensions in emerging markets, especially Turkey and Argentina, initiated some flight to safety mainly towards US investments. In the near future, the threat to global trade created by protectionist tensions, and growing political uncertainties, also in Europe following the developments in Italy and a significant probability of a hard Brexit may weigh negatively on the global environment.  In addition, the European insurance sector has been facing an unprecedented and challenging low interest rate environment for the past four years. The downward trend in bond yields had a direct impact on the return on investments, especially for life insurers 
3  who hold a substantial portion of their investments in bond securities. The dilution of investment yields has reinforced risks for the industry such as a serious lapse risk if interest rates were to rise abruptly, financial losses for insurers who guarantee high technical rates compared to financial returns, or risks related to insufficient cost coverage.   Among this quick review of the most salient characteristics of the environment in which insurers have been operating I would like to add that climate change risk has now become a reality and although insurers usually know how to deal with climate risks, including in extreme events, it is more than likely that further adjustments will be needed.    Against this backdrop, French insurance companies have reacted in three main ways: lowering of paid interest rates in life insurance, development of alternative investment strategies and adaptation of their traditional business model including  an increased business diversification. As a result, for instance, unit-linked liabilities  are increasing, and the profit-sharing payments for euro-denominated contracts are decreasing. However, I note that these payments remain significantly higher for mutual undertakings: they amounted to 2.3% last year while the French average is lower, and the reserves for deferred profit sharing have been strongly reinforced and amount to approximately 6% of mathematical reserves at YE 2017, which is 50% higher than the French average.   As a result, French insurance companies remain fairly solid, and the own funds held largely cover regulatory solvency capital requirements for both life and non-life insurance companies, which is an important asset in the challenging environment in which they are operating. This is notably the case for the mutual insurance sector. Its solvency coverage ratio significantly exceeds 300%, which is higher than the average in France, thanks in particular to their prudent and long-term approach, with less pressure from the financial markets.   However, adapting to a challenging environment does not come without new risks. For instance, it is necessary to closely monitor risks related to policyholder protection and advice, the excessive lengthening of bond maturities or the over aggressive search for yield.  Now, I would like to focus on regulatory developments, which are numerous and may have an impact on the insurance business model going forward. The French insurance landscape has experienced major regulatory changes over recent years: a modification 
4  of the taxation system of life/savings insurance contracts (Flat Tax), the possibility of changing credit insurance contracts annually (Loi Hamon/Amendement Bourquin), and the creation of a specific prudential status for French pension funds. The new Pacte Bill should bring about further changes that seek to promote long-term investment in equity, including a reform of the French life long-term insurance product (also known as Eurocroissance).   In addition, at international and European level significant regulatory developments are also in the making. At the international level, the IAIS work on systemic insurers and the international capital standard (or ICS) has recently made significant strides. As you know, as part of its post-crisis action plan, the IAIS developed in 2013 an identification method for systemic risks, reviewed in 2016. This led to the identification of nine global systemically important insurers, to which specific measures are applied (increased supervision, specific management plans, chiefly for liquidity, recovery and resolution, and a capital add-on measure, currently postponed to 2022). Given the recognised shortcomings of the methodology, including weak factual basis, the FSB asked the IAIS to review it with three key focuses: developing an activities-based approach supplementing the entity-based approach, which itself will be reviewed in order to correct deficiencies. A new framework is hence being developed which will make it possible to reconcile an activities-based and an entities-based approach, to better capture relevant risks and systemic undertakings. In the meantime, the list of global systemic insurers will remain frozen for 2019 and could be suspended beyond and until 2022, so that enough experience is gained with the new approach.  Regarding the International Capital Standard, which aims to develop an international capital standard in order to be able to establish a comparable basis in terms of prudential requirements for all international groups, recent progress was made in Kuala Lumpur in November 2017 which should lead to, by the end of 2019, a version called “ICS 2.0” that will be used as a reference in international supervision Colleges, for a transitory period of five years. During this timeframe, each internationally active insurance group will have to ensure a compulsory and confidential five-year monitoring period based on the ICS, after which this standard is expected to become effective.   Now, I will turn to IFRS17: it would be unreasonable to apply the new IFRS17 accounting framework right now. Given the obvious issue of timing, it is quite welcome that the IASB reopened the discussion and that the application of this standard has now been postponed by one year. This will primarily give us time to reach an agreement on identifying groups of loss-making contracts. We also want to bring the discussion on the 
5  treatment of reinsurance contracts held to a satisfactory conclusion. At this point, there is too much room for interpretation in the standard, which could interfere with the comparability and consistent application across countries.  In Europe, the current “hot topic” is the forthcoming Solvency 2 review. This review must include a full and objective assessment of the framework that has now been in place for three years.  Of course, insurers have significantly improved their risk and capital management under Solvency 2, and the insurance market is now more resilient and better equipped to cope with financial crises. The average SCR ratio in the European Union stood at 241% in the first quarter of 2018. It tends to be even higher for mutual insurers  But these positives must not be allowed to overshadow the questions that need to be asked after such a radical change, particularly about the impact on equity investment and the financing of the European economy, as well as issues relating to volatility and complexity.  Therefore I invite Insurers to play an active role in the discussions that should come with the so-called “Long Term Guarantee Package” or 2020 review.  As was the case with the 2018 review, the ACPR will call for further progress towards a significant simplification of the framework. We also expect the review to better take into account the impact of Solvency 2 on the financing of the economy.  This said, and irrespective of the outcome of the forthcoming reviews, the proportionality principle and its harmonised application across the European Union will remain a major concern for EIOPA and of course for ACPR. On a topical note, I would add that it is crucial for supervisors to apply all prudential requirements with equal rigour. The string of failures by insurers doing business on the French market under the freedom to provide services, particularly in construction insurance, is a reminder of the importance of this. The Freedom of Provisions of Services is sometimes at odds with the specific features of national markets. Complex and long-term products require improved skills on the part of both the insurers providing the products and the supervisory authorities, with EIOPA’s support. The requisite convergence of supervisory practices needs to become a reality very soon. I know that EIOPA is making this a priority. Incidentally, the three-year review of the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs), is underway. Following a public consultation proposed by the European Commission, the draft legislation looks to strengthen the authorities’ and chiefly EIOPA’s role and powers without 
6  calling into question the existing architecture. This should support the goal of increased convergence in supervisory practices, which should in turn promote improved effectiveness. Accordingly, the proposal represents a positive step forward for Europe. However, a close eye should be kept on the place given to national supervisors, especially regarding the question of internal models and supervisory colleges. They should remain within the national supervisors’ realm of competence, while EIOPA’s mediation role is essential and should be reinforced, especially with regard to cross-border issues. However, this is incompatible with assuming responsibility for validating national internal models. As for the EIOPA role on cross-border cases and its guidance for national supervisors that some Member States would favour, such exchanges could take place within dedicated coordination platforms.  Beyond regulatory adaptation, the challenges ahead relate to technological and environmental changes, which are new and yet crucial matters for attention for insurers, regulators and supervisors. Insurance players, of all sizes and risk exposures, are facing the digital revolution, which is inescapable as the developments in other business sectors such as travel, tourism or catering show. To remain competitive in terms of customer relationships, insurers will need to raise their customer experience to the highest levels. This will require them to fundamentally review their processes, tools and information systems. It also calls for an upgrade of their human resources policies. The risks associated with the digital revolution are numerous, but I would like to stress the bigger risk associated with procrastination. This risk seems particularly important to me and it will be an essential focus of attention for supervisors. The digital revolution has other ramifications that require the attention of supervisors. One of them is the increasing inclusion of insurance products within package deals. This is particularly the case for affinity insurance products. These often involve the multiplication of intermediaries in the value chain. This phenomenon can blur responsibilities and the intrinsic economic value of these products, and we are therefore vigilant as consumer protection is especially important in a strengthened European regulatory framework for product governance (via the Insurance Distribution Directive in particular).  Another one is the access and use of data. To remain competitive in the customer relationship and risk management, access to data and the ability to efficiently use them will be essential. These developments will involve further cooperation between the personal data protection authorities and the insurance supervisory authorities. This cooperation has already 
7  become a reality thanks to the CNIL's (National Commission for Information Technology and Civil Liberties) presence in the Artificial Intelligence Task Force led by the ACPR, which will publish a report in the coming months. I hope that this cooperation will deepen further in the coming years. As a result, data are more than ever a strategic asset. In these circumstances, faced with the risks of cybercrime, it is imperative to ensure security. The digital revolution has been accompanied by the emergence of IT attacks, which have been increasingly publicised. The insurance industry, where information systems play a major operational role, has not been immune to such cyber-attacks. Insurers now need to manage and guard against this risk, which, in their case, is increased by the criticality of data (medical, personal, financial, etc.) handled and stored in their information systems. Public authorities are seeking to address these challenges and have undertaken major initiatives to raise awareness among insurers as to this new type of operational risk, as the IT systems of the insurance sector are still too vulnerable.   It is primarily up to the market to design efficient security schemes compatible with the opening-up of information systems and innovation. This is a huge challenge, but it is in this spirit that the ACPR works. Cyber security remains one of our supervisory priorities for the coming years and it is important to actively maintain or engage our dialogue in this regard, facilitate the emergence and dissemination of best practices, and strengthen the resilience of the insurance sector.  In this decisive transition phase, I would like to draw your attention to the ACPR's paper on IT risk, which discusses best practices regarding IT risks and more specifically cyber risk. While the digital revolution creates new risks for insurers as targets, it also offers new opportunities for growth in the industry to cover the cyber risk of their policyholders. The ACPR will therefore be particularly vigilant in the development of cyber insurance, which again requires insurers to adapt, manage a ”new” risk in terms of selection and underwriting, pricing, and portfolio oversight.  The last supervision priority I would like to mention is related to climate change. Although losses from natural disasters in the world during the first half of 2018 were half of those observed during the same period in 20171, this is not good news. The long-term impact of                                                  1 Losses amounted in USD 33 billion in the first half of 2018 and USD 65 billion in the first half of 2017 
8  climate change remains a key area of vigilance for insurers, as climatologists foresee a long-term increase in natural disasters. Such changes impact both sides of the insurers’ balance sheet, via the increase in physical risks and transition risks to a low carbon economy, and more work is obviously needed to address them properly.   For instance, no common methodology has been developed yet to properly assess the impact of the foreseen increase in the frequency of natural catastrophes. Regarding the exposure to transition risks to a lower carbon economy, the exposures of the French insurers to such a risk have been assessed. At the end of 2017, EUR 250 billion, or around 10% of the total portfolio of the French insurers, was invested in sectors defined as sensitive to transition risk, which can be seen as a significant exposure. This figure is only a ballpark figure, though, as definitions of and methodologies to measure the carbon footprint of assets portfolios are still under construction.   These examples show that there is still not sufficient recognition of the need to act rapidly in order to reach the objectives of the Paris agreement in terms of climate change. Regulators’ actions have to give the right incentives for players to act more quickly. In this respect, the Banque de France and the ACPR have set up and are actively coordinating the network of central banks and supervisors for Greening the Financial system (NGFS).  Let me conclude by saying that mutual insurers are of course exposed to all the challenges I have mentioned. I trust that they are willing and well equipped to live up to them. Over the last years and in order to face new challenges, the mutual sector, which historically comprised a large number of entities, has adapted and has successfully achieved the necessary concentrations. It is important that it continues to adapt, including at an international level, especially since the values of mutual insurance are essential to the stability of the insurance model based on risk-sharing.   Thank you all for your attention. 
              RESERVE BANK OF FIJI  1    KEYNOTE ADDRESS BY THE RESERVE BANK OF FIJI GOVERNOR, MR ARIFF ALI  SOUTH PACIFIC CENTRAL BANKING RESEARCH CONFERENCE,  12 DECEMBER 2018, HOLIDAY INN, SUVA   Your Excellency, Ms Amy Crago, Australian Deputy High Commissioner to Fiji; Mr Loi Bakani, Governor, Bank of Papua New Guinea; Mr Denton Rarawa, Governor, Central Bank of Solomon Islands; Deputy Governors and fellow central bankers; Members of the Griffith University Faculty; Distinguished Guests and Participants; Ladies and Gentlemen;  Bula Vinaka! It is indeed an honor for me to give the keynote address in this Inaugural South Pacific Central Banking Research Conference, co-hosted by Griffith University and the central banks of Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and Fiji.   In fact, I am delighted that we central bankers in the Pacific have taken this bold step to strengthen our research capacity, which is evident by the high-level attendance today, of representative central banks from the region.  Our being here also demonstrates our sincere appreciation of the commitment of Griffith University and the Australian Government to assist in the research capacity of our Pacific central banks. 
              RESERVE BANK OF FIJI  2  I wish to congratulate Dr Pramendra Sharma and the team from Griffith University for convening this conference, an ultimate outcome of some years of dedicated work to highlight the research initiatives of our Pacific central bankers and provide a platform for dialogue, information sharing and future research opportunities. Deputy Governor Masitabua has welcomed us all last night so I do not wish to repeat his welcome, but I only wish to mention that the Reserve Bank of Fiji is indeed privileged to co-host this inaugural Conference and we look forward to fruitful deliberations in the next two days.  Collaboration with Griffith University Ladies and Gentlemen, I wish to share at the outset a brief background of our journey with Griffith University.  The Griffith-South Pacific Central Banks (SPCBs) partnership with the support of the Australian Government has come a long way, from one joint-working paper with the RBF in 2014 to almost 25 published and partially completed working papers amongst the four central banks represented here today.  We have indeed proven ourselves as worthy partners with Griffith University, and we can only expect bigger and better outcomes from this great partnership. I understand that one joint-paper under this collaboration has been published in the “Review of Pacific Basin Financial Markets and Policies”, a prestigious academic journal in Singapore, and another has been accepted for publication in the “Journal of the Asia Pacific Economy”.  Our Griffith counterparts have assured us that some of our regional joint papers are good potentials for top-ranked journals in the coming years.   There is certainly much to be excited about, for a unique regional partnership of this kind, yet, it would be remiss of me if I did not acknowledge a certain individual whose confidence in our work, and tireless efforts behind the scenes got us in the door with Griffith University. Ladies and gentlemen, we would not have come this far if it was not for the key role played by Dr. Parmendra Sharma, a former colleague of us here at the Reserve Bank of Fiji.  Had it not been for his work in linking our researchers to the Griffith experts and securing the necessary funding through the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs & Trade (DFAT), I believe we would not be having this conference today. 
              RESERVE BANK OF FIJI  3  I am also pleased to mention that Dr Sharma has just been recognized for his collaborative work with central banks in the Pacific by being awarded the 2018 Griffith Business School Pro Vice Chancellor’s Engagement Leadership Award.  Our heartiest congratulations to you Dr Sharma!  Let me now move on to the three key messages that I wish to share today: 1. Being Small Should not be an Excuse for not Conducting Good Research A favourite quote that I share a lot and make reference to in my regular discussions with my staff and external stakeholders of the Reserve Bank of Fiji is by Dr Zeti Akhtar Aziz, Former Governor of Bank Negara Malaysia, and she said:  “The central bank is a high impact organization.  Its decisions or indecisions, its actions or inactions will have major and far reaching repercussions and consequences on the economic well-being of the public at large and the entire spectrum of businesses.  The responsibility and accountability are therefore immense........Central banking is therefore not for the faint of heart.” We cannot, therefore, make the excuse of being small central banks, as a limiting factor to our research capabilities, because the responsibility and accountability we play in our small economies are immense.  Our business is about bringing value and benefits to our citizens as policy making institutions and while research allows us as policymakers to do our job better, good research lends credibility and improves the quality of our policy.  So we ask the question, what is necessary to produce good research at the central bank?  There is no single formula for this but there are some necessary conditions for doing good research: (i) First, there must be support from the top, and in our case from the central bank governors.  Without this support, any attempt to build a good research department will most likely fail.  I would like to say that the presence of us Governors in this conference is a testament of our support for research in our central banks. 
              RESERVE BANK OF FIJI  4  For us at the RBF, two significant initiatives were implemented as part of our collaboration with Griffith University. We have set up a Research Unit in our Economics Group with the aim to produce more research papers.  Selected staff are rotated to the Unit as an opportunity to undertake research and produce working papers.  In addition, the RBF now provides staff with a cash reward of $1000 if their research is published as either working papers or journal articles. (ii) Second, there must be highly trained research staff and a system of measuring quantity and quality of research output.  Investing in the continuous development of our central bank staff is important and I know that a significant part of our central bank budgets is allocated to training and development.  We must continue with this and have as a priority the need to build highly trained research officers.  However, a real challenge faced by our small central banks is attracting and retaining research capacity and capability as many of our staff are so inclined to leave us for Universities that pay more and conduct more research.  More collaboration with academic institutions and research institutes such as the one we now have with Griffith could help address this. Going forward, we have to establish a system of measuring the quantity and quality of our research outcomes.  Credibility and quality of research is crucial and good evidence through a policy proposal supported by good research is highly likely to be considered for decision making.  Research must also be forward looking in nature to be relevant when the issues it addresses are faced by policy makers. (iii) Third, there must be a productive and rich research environment for good research to be possible.  One way to ensure this is making our central banks open to external research from academia, the fruits of which we are witnessing today through our collaboration with Griffith University.  There is room therefore for more collaboration, which brings me to the second key message that I wish to share today: 2. Extending our Research Collaboration beyond the Griffith University My second key message is that we should extend our research beyond the current collaborations with Griffith University.  Our role as central banks has never been more important than it is today.  We have the core responsibility to promote macroeconomic and financial stability but our mandate has also expanded to include financial sector 
              RESERVE BANK OF FIJI  5  development, consumer protection and financial literacy.  This is a significant undertaking that calls for close collaboration with public sector agencies, private sector organisations, academic institutions and regional organisations.  I would therefore strongly recommend that we consider extending the collaboration that we have now started with Griffith University to other institutions and agencies in our countries and in the region.  These include PFTAC, Regional ADB, World Bank and IFC Offices, possibility USP, and FNU. In acknowledgement of the limited resources for our research functions and data availability being a real constraint in our small island economies, such collaboration should assist in addressing these challenges. Expanding our collaboration to other institutions will also help better communicate our policies to the public, improve our credibility as policymakers and contribute to the general knowledge that benefits society as a whole. 3. Central Banks should rightfully be Centers of Research in our Developing Economies My third and final message to my central bank colleagues is that central banks should rightfully be the center of research in our developing economies.   I had stated earlier the reference made to central banks as high impact organisations.  In an environment of greater transparency and enhanced communication, expectations are high on the delivery of our results.  As central banks, we have to be knowledge intensive institutions and derive our influence mainly from the quality of our arguments, which requires a strong research function. Central bank continuity provides institutional memory.  A central bank accumulates knowledge both from research and experience.  Governments change, but central banks stay.  We are one of the most important reservoirs of knowledge that rightfully places us as the center of research in our small economies.  While we acknowledge that we do not have access to quality, timely and reliable data in most instances, it should not stop us from using simple-excel based analysis and developing policy solutions based on our own unique experiences and institutional knowledge. 
              RESERVE BANK OF FIJI  6  The importance of evidence-based policy meetings and deliberations cannot be emphasised enough.  Our regional central banks need to continue partnering with relevant stakeholder institutions as we aim to up-skill our researchers, build capacity and narrow the knowledge gap. Conclusion Ladies and Gentlemen, this conference is a great example of collaboration at the regional level on an issue that is core to our central banking role.  Being the first of its kind in the region, it is my hope that the two-day Conference will stimulate vigorous debate and allow the sharing of diverse opinions to address some of the financial and economic challenges facing our Pacific Islands.  I congratulate all our researchers who will be presenting their work during the conference.  The research papers are the culmination of critical thinking and innovative proposals that should be encouraged to the next step of being published in reputable journals. In closing, I wish you all a successful workshop and I trust that the knowledge-sharing will be useful and rewarding to you personally and to your respective organizations and countries. I also hope that you will find time to enjoy Suva.  It may be challenging to listen to all the technical discussions planned, especially having such a conference in the festive month of December, so please do enjoy our Fijian hospitality and may I also take this opportunity to wish you all a blessed Christmas and a prosperous 2019.  Thank you! 
OFFICIAL LAUNCH OF BBS LIMITED PALAPYE BRANCH  Keynote Speech  by  Moses D Pelaelo Governor, Bank of Botswana  November 26, 2018   It is an honour and a great pleasure to join you here this morning for the official opening of Botswana Building Society Limited (BBS), Palapye Branch. Palapye is evidently one of the fastest growing villages in the country. Growth, in this instance, is a function of response to economic opportunities, including actual and potential demand for services. I have no doubt that the decision by Botswana Building Society to establish a physical presence here is similarly a realisation of the potential to serve the proximate community, generate business returns and be part of the Palapye growth narrative.  Distinguished Guests, by way of background, the Botswana Building Society is an offshoot of United Building Society of South Africa, which started operations in Botswana in November 1971. It subsequently transformed to Botswana Building Society in December 1976, with a primary mandate to provide housing finance against immovable urban property, 
2 later extended, in 1986, to cover rural areas, and indeed commercial loans.   The latest transformation, from a friendly, mutual society to a public limited company, incorporated in April 2018, is of great significance in many respects. First, it allows broader scope for consideration of strategy, sustainable funding and provision of a wider array of services by Botswana Building Society.  In this regard, there is greater potential to respond to economic opportunities, drive operational excellence and capacity to meet diverse customer needs; thus enhance the value of services to customers, as well as prospects for sustainable returns and growth. Second, Botswana Building Society recently placed its shares on the Serala platform, which is for unlisted equities, at the Botswana Stock Exchange and has shares of over P564 million. This development provides yet another opportunity for ownership and strategic control of a home-grown, prudently managed and profitable financial institution by Batswana. The expectation of Bank of Botswana is that this transformation and growth will be prudently managed and achieved in an environment of sound operations, to ensure durable and beneficial impact on the economy.    Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen, it is fitting to recognise the growth and impact of Botswana Building Society on the 
3 economic landscape and as part of the financial sector of this country. Taking the twenty years to 2017, the assets of Botswana Building Society have increased at an average annual rate of 13.9 percent.  This compares with an annual growth rate of 16.2 percent for commercial banks and 12.3 percent average annual increase in nominal GDP. This suggests a meaningful contribution to the economic and financial development of the country.  Dissecting further, the average annual growth in residential mortgage loans was 14.2 percent, compared to 21.8 percent for commercial banks.  Another interesting comparison is that outstanding residential mortgages by Botswana Building Society as at the end of June 2018 amounted to P2.9 billion, constituting 31 percent of the total of P9.3 billion for the commercial banks, which for the individual banks, ranged from a smallest value of P2.3 million to the largest amount of P3.2 billion.    Distinguished Guests, this represents some of the relevant information that should inform prospective growth areas, strategic initiatives, and resource requirements of Botswana Building Society, going forward. Interestingly, Botswana Building Society Limited is reportedly making efforts to enhance its service offering and, therefore, potentially greater impact on society and the economy. In this regard, I wish to underscore that, to ensure an enduring and mutually rewarding 
4 relationship, businesses need to treat customers with respect and dignity.  To this end, it is pleasing that Botswana Building Society Limited has, as its motto, “we know you better”, which I suppose means, a moral and corporate commitment that BBS staff will give you the respect and service quality that you deserve, here in Palapye.  Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen, let me now turn to expectations on closing existing gaps with respect to housing finance, resource mobilisation and impact on welfare and sustained increase in incomes. First, it is germane to acknowledge the low level of housing finance in Botswana relative to the size of the economy.  For example, residential mortgage lending amounts to 21.6 percent of total bank lending (including statutory banks); 14 percent of total assets of banks; and only 6.9 percent of GDP.  Compared to more mature housing markets, these figures are very low.  For example, the respective ratios for the United Kingdom are, 70.8 percent of total banking lending; 36.6 percent of total banking assets and 52.7 percent of GDP. This demonstrates the gap in development and the opportunities.    Significantly, growth in this area represents an important source of future income growth and wealth generation. This is in several respects.  For individuals, this relates to the opportunity 
5 to invest earnings meaningfully, use of the value of houses to generate other economic activities and sources of income, and potential for increase in wealth over time, as well as serving as a potent hedge against inflation.  For the broader economy, there are benefits in terms of a continuous build-up of the volume and variety of stock of housing, alongside growth in the population and incomes.  Potentially, this could also have significant distributional effects and, if housing credit is more inclusive, it can reduce income inequality. Furthermore, developed economies, with well-functioning financial systems, such as the United States of America, attest to the fact that citizens can access, in a disciplined and beneficial manner, the so-called “excess equity” in their mortgaged properties and use their houses as ATMs!  Moreover, with unconstrained growth in mortgage finance and housing, there are incidental economic opportunities relating to the construction industry and related services, thus contributing to economic diversification.    Distinguished Guests, the second point is that such prospects, however, need support in terms of a land tenure policy that facilitates the use of the various forms of land and real estate across the country to secure mortgage financing.  This helps in terms of both financing and marketability of land and property countrywide, with the attendant economic opportunities. Therefore, the Improvement of Land Administration, 
6 Procedures and Systems (LAPCAS) project, that should ease constraints to using land acquired under different tenures as collateral for mortgages, is a welcome development.  In this regard, it is our expectation that BBS and, of course other financial institutions in this country, will respond positively in providing affordable credit that the average household in Botswana can access.   The third dimension, Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen, is that the supporting services need to be robust and sound.  Among others, this relates to professionalism around property valuations to ensure that the resultant loan financing is aligned to housing market realities; thus safeguarding the interests of both the financier and the customer; respectively, as well as the soundness of financial institutions and welfare of households. Going forward, the development of a credible property price index and enhancement of sharing of credit information through well-organised credit bureaux would be helpful.  Therefore, we agree with the observation made by the Centre for Affordable Housing Finance in Africa, in their 9th Edition of The Housing Finance Yearbook, that “a combination of a good macroeconomic environment, sound policy, better data and increased access to affordable credit” should spur the development of a vibrant housing market to the benefit of a large segment of the population.    
7 Fourth, appropriately structured resource mobilisation is key to successful provision of housing finance and related services.  Given that housing finance is inherently long-term in nature and that there is an imperative for further growth in Botswana, it should be supported by a large pool of stable deposits and/or investments.  This is afforded by attracting a range of small to large deposits, with associated transactional and return incentives.  The point here is that active deposit mobilisation is critical for availing funds that can be deployed to support housing finance without undermining the viability of the financial institution.  In addition, a robust capital market that facilitates seamless raising of long-term funds, including corporate bonds to suit various needs, is also needed.  It is accepted that, as a matter of prudence, we should not burden short-term finance or worsen the structural maturity mismatches widely prevalent in the country’s financial system.  Moreover, there is a need to invest in capacity to develop derivative instruments that facilitate risk sharing, as well as transformation and trading of assets and liabilities; thus alleviate constraints to mortgage financing.  Regrettably, in this regard, the Botswana financial system is way behind the curve and, despite banking industry outcry about tight market liquidity in recent years, there is not much evidence of any innovative and structured products, such as mortgage-backed securities, negotiable certificates of deposit or credit default swaps.     
8 For its part, the Bank of Botswana has entrenched a largely credible monetary policy framework, with inflation sustained within the objective range of 3 – 6 percent and allowing for maintenance of relatively low interest rates.  Furthermore, effective regulatory oversight and prudently managed financial institutions continue to contribute to maintenance of a sound and stable financial system.  In this regard, well-anchored expectations, premised on a credible policy framework, supports determination of term structure of interest rates, relevant for both resource mobilisation and pricing of long-term loans.  The policy environment is, therefore, conducive for orderly and effective intermediation and productive use of financial resources; and in the context of the theme of my message today, affordable cost of housing finance.   Distinguished Guests, the fifth point, I want to highlight is the importance of presence of institutions and access to services, as demonstrated by the opening of the Palapye Branch of Botswana Building Society.  Geographical spread of financial institutions allows for proximate access to financial services, in terms of both acquaintance and usage.  This augurs well for financial inclusion.  Thus, when people know about the existence and benefits of services and facilities, and when these are accessible in a convenient and cost-effective manner, they are more likely to use such services. Increasingly, “virtual” 
9 presence and access enabled by digital channels has become a viable platform for access to services and needs to be harnessed accordingly.  Overall, presence and accessibility enhance prospects for mobilisation of financial resources, and effective demand for housing finance and other beneficial loan products; ultimately leading to increase in social welfare, as well as the broadening and growth of economic activity.   I should, therefore, acknowledge that, currently, Botswana Building Society has offices and branches in Francistown, Gaborone, Kasane, Lobatse, Maun, Selibe Phikwe, Serowe; and now Palapye, in addition to twelve automated teller machines (ATMs) countrywide.  More significantly, BBS has and continues to invest in various corporate social responsibility projects worth millions of Pula. Among these projects are a school library in Letswai Primary School in Zutshwa; computer labs at Marapong and Mowana Primary Schools in the Central and North East Districts, respectively, as well as building new ablution facilities and upgrading old ones at Molapowabojang Primary School.  These investments in educational facilities will go a long way in contributing towards good education for our children and this is to be applauded.   On that note, let me conclude by indicating that it is my expectation that patronage and use of financial services will 
10 increase because of this new branch.  Thus, with relevant business strategies by Botswana Building Society, as well as facilitative policy environment, this branch will foster and sustain financial inclusion and, in turn, the attendant benefits of productive saving and use of finance, access to payments services, and broadly, enhanced economic activity.  I implore you all, Palapye residents, the surrounding areas and beyond, to use BBS and other financial institutions in your area, to save; to access and use credit wisely, for the benefit of your families and sustainable development of the country.    It is now my honour and privilege to declare the BBS Limited Palapye Branch officially open.  I thank you for your kind attention.

 Page | 2   Madam President of the Chartered Institute of Bankers, President of the Ghana Association of Bankers, Executive Secretary of Ghana Association of Bankers, CEOs of Banks, Colleague Bankers and Banking Students, Invited Guests, Members of the Press, Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen  1. Good evening. All too soon, a year has passed by and we are once again gathered for this special occasion which brings together all the distinguished professionals in this very unique profession. Thank you for the invitation to this dinner and to address the Institute of Bankers at the end of a week-long of activities marking “Bankers” week. It has now become a tradition for the Governor of the Bank to talk about the developments in the banking and financial sector, the economy and the outlook for the ensuing year, and I will like to continue that tradition tonight. This will be the second time that I am doing so.    2. We thank the Almighty God for seeing us through another year where we have worked together as stakeholders to shape the future of banking in our dear nation. A lot has been achieved and a lot more remains to be done to position the banking sector as the catalyst for the accelerated socio-economic growth that all Ghanaians desire.  
 Page | 3    3.  Let me take the opportunity to welcome new members of our fraternity. In particular, I welcome Consolidated Bank Ghana Limited, and all new or incoming Managing Directors, Executive and non-Executive Directors, and senior management. We say Akwaaba and we look forward to you playing your part as we together build this industry for future generations. To the outgoing executves or officers, I say Ayeekoo for your contributions to the industry and we wish you well in your future endeavours.   4. Madam President, our industry is one of the key pillars essential to the realization of the high aspirations for development of the Ghanaian people. The sustainability of the banking industry is critical to the vision. As such, all stakeholders must work to ensure that banks operate within an enabling environment that supports them to carry out their financial intermediation function.   5. Madam President, a year ago when I first addressed this gathering, we were faced with many challenges in the financial sector and had begun a process of introducing reforms that would be needed to build resilience. The reforms aimed at strengthening the sector to become strong, solid, well capitalised, and better positioned to support a fast growing 
 Page | 4   economy. Madam President, as expected, these reforms continued into 2018, as we sought to also overhaul the entire supervisory framework.   6. Madam President, the financial systems stability remains central to the development agenda of the country. Historically, central banks used the lender of last resort function as the principal tool to ensure stability. Today financial stability goes beyond the lender of last resort function. Indeed financial stability and monetary policy are complementary as without financial stability, monetary policy impulses to the economy cannot be transmitted to the real economy. In Ghana, the central bank is mandated under its laws; the Bank of Ghana Act, 2002 (Act 612) as amended by Act 918 of 2016, and the Banks and Specialised Deposit-taking Institutions (BSDI) Act, 2016 (Act 930) to ensure a safe and sound financial sector.  7. Madam President, we inherited a financial system which was under a considerable state of distress, with banks that were not meeting capital adequacy requirement, banks that had suffered capital erosion with high non-performing loans which had led to a weak transmission of monetary policy to the real economy. Some of these banks were insolvent and illiquid, others were solvent but illiquid. Our predecessors continued to provide 
 Page | 5   liquidity support to these weak failing banks, without addressing the underlying problems that led to the illiquidity and insolvency of these institutions. In short, the financial system had reached a tipping point and we could not just have assumed business as usual. The cleaning up objective was to ensure the orderly exit of insolvent banks from the industry with the view that any bank licensed and regulated by the Bank of Ghana is guaranteed to access your deposits when you need them and not to victimize wholly owned Ghanaian entities as our detractors sought to impugn. The reforms were also aimed at addressing the legacy problems in the banking sector such as the poor corporate governance, false financial reporting, and insider dealings, and other practices that left some banks insolvent.   8. Madam President, we took decisive actions underpinned by a strengthened legal framework under the Bank of Ghana Act, 2002 (Act 612) as amended by Act 918 of 2016, and the Banks and Specialised Deposit-taking Institutions (BSDI) Act, 2016 (Act 930). We closed a total of seven insolvent banks, and protected depositors’ claims by the government to ensure that the rest of the banking sector did not suffer contagion.     9. There is no doubt that the failure of the seven banks came at a cost to the Ghanaian taxpayer, staff of the affected banks, and 
 Page | 6   to an extent, shaked confidence in the financial sector. However, the decisions we took as a regulator protected the deposits of more than 1.5 million customers with deposit values of over GH¢10 billion. Additionally, the orderly intervention and revocation of these licences and the purchase and assumption transactions that ensued minimized the potential adverse impacts by ensuring that about 70 percent of the 5,000 jobs in the affected banks were saved. This would be contrasted to what could have been the imploding of these banks and the contagion that could have resulted.  10. Madam President, lessons learnt so far from the resolution experiences within the past two years have helped shape the reforms that are being introduced in the sector. What has become very clear is the need for more regulatory and supervisory vigilance to properly safeguard the new banking system after the reforms.   11. Madam President, one key lesson learnt was the level of related-party transactions that have become so endemic in the banks that were resolved. This has informed our decision to operationalize, in 2019, the directive on financial holding companies which seeks to facilitate effective consolidated supervision of regulated financial institutions and ensure that 
 Page | 7   holding companies and affiliates of banks and SDIs do not take advantage of banks and SDIs within such groups at the expense of depositors and other creditors. In addition, the government has indicated that it will set up a high-level financial stability council with a key objective of bringing together all financial sector regulatory bodies and the Ministry of Finance to work together to minimize, if not eliminate, regulatory arbitrage and other sector-wide risks.   12. Another key lesson was the weaknesses in the corporate governance structures in some banks. Earlier this year, we issued the corporate governance directive to address the fundamental flaws observed in the governance process drawing on international corporate governance principles developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. We have received feedback several comments from some of you on the draft Transitional Provisions for implementation of the directive. We will finalise these provisions and public a final version by the end of 2018.   13. We have also introduced the Fit and Proper Person’s Directive which aims to reinforce provisions in the corporate governance directive, especially in respect of whether a person is fit to be a director, a significant shareholder, or a key 
 Page | 8   management personnel in a regulated institution. Our initial assessment shows that these directives are already shaping the corporate governance structures within the banking industry as we continue to ensure full compliance.    14. The industry’s effort at reducing the high levels of non-performing loans is gradually taking shape, partly due to compliance with the loan write-off directive. We expect further improvements in asset quality with the appropriate disclosures of loan write-offs in banks’ year-end published financial statements. The draft Credit Reporting Regulations and the draft Borrowers and Lenders Bill are in their final stages. When completed and passed by Parliament, these pieces of legislation should help improve the credit underwriting process and facilitate enforcement of loan and collateral agreements by banks and other regulated institutions.   15. Madam President, banks have adopted and are implementing the global credit risk management and financial reporting standards. Currently, the quarterly financial publications of banks are reported in line with IFRS 9, using the expected credit loss standard. This is improving on credit risk management frameworks and enabling banks effectively measure risks embedded in their credit portfolio. The full impact and benefits 
 Page | 9   of this new standard in our credit administration process is expected to materialise in the coming year.  16. To improve on the compliance and risk governance within the banking sector, the Bank of Ghana during the year issued the final Capital Requirement Directive for compliance which will become effective in January 2019, coinciding with the completion of the increased minimum capital requirement for the industry. Banks are currently in the parallel-run phase which ends in December 2018. The Banking Supervision Department is working with the industry to ensure that all the challenges faced by banks are resolved for a smooth transition to the full implementation of the Basel II/III pillar 1 capital measurement (capital adequacy).   17. Madam President, the fight against financial crime in our industry and the entire financial system received a major boost this year when the central bank in collaboration with other sector agencies of Government, launched the Cyber and Information Security Directive (CISD), and also opened the Bank’s Security Operations Centre (SOC), during the National Cyber Security Awareness Month celebrations in October. Among others, the CISD provides a framework for establishing cyber and information security protocols, establishment of reporting 
 Page | 10   mechanisms and physical security measures for IT Data centres and control rooms, and assurance of data and network security. The directive contains an implementation schedule for banks and other regulated institutions to follow, which is currently being monitored by the Bank.   18. In addition, there is a guide to Enhanced Competency Framework (ECF) towards the building of cyber security competencies for industry players and I will encourage you to implement this framework as we work towards having effective cyber security controls in place to counter cyber and financial crime.   19. Madam President, the Bank of Ghana has provided the needed resources for the take-off of the Ghana Deposit Protection Corporation (GDPC). Under the Ghana Deposit Protection Act, 2016 (Act 931), as amended, the Ghana Deposit Protection Scheme will be operational in or before September 2019. Banks and SDIs will be onboarded and will start contributions to the scheme by September 2019. During the year, the GDPC actively engaged various stakeholders to create public awareness of their operations and the expected role of banks, SDIs and the microfinance institutions to be enrolled in the scheme. The GDPC would continue to engage the industry 
 Page | 11   and the general public to ensure smooth take-off in September 2019.  20. Madam President, as you will recall, about a year ago, we announced an increase in the minimum capital requirement for all universal banks to GHC400 million by end December 2018. A few people have wondered why the increase, but we all know that the more capital a bank has the safer it is. Bank owners want to have less capital and instead borrow more in what is called leverage to earn a greater return on their investments and using less of their own money.  The most a bank owner loses in the case of a bank run is their capital but the wider public loses a lot more.  It is therefore important we  set the capital level in the banking sector to minimize the cost to society of a bank failing while ensuring the banking system also remains profitable. It remains our view that this new capital floor will help make banks stronger and resilient and position them to better support the Ghanaian economy. With a few days to end the year, the Bank of Ghana has been reviewing the capital build-up plans of banks, providing guidance to banks opting for mergers and acquisitions and voluntary liquidations through the issuance of the Mergers and Acquisition Directive and the Directive on Voluntary Winding-up respectively. I am happy to inform you that significant progress has been made in this area and as at November 2018, 
 Page | 12   we can confidently say that about twenty-two (22) banks have either met or in good standing to achieve full compliance with the new minimum capital requirement. We have therefore intensified monitoring of the process as we bring closure to the recapitalisation process on December 31, 2018.   21.  Recent developments in the banking sector reflect gains from the on-going reforms in the sector, which are expected to further increase after the recapitalization process is completed in December 2018. In addition to making profits, banks now have more assets with capital adequacy ratios well above required regulatory levels. It is therefore not surprising that the improving banking sector stability partly accounted for Standard and Poor’s recent upgrade of Ghana’s long-term rating to ‘B’ from ‘B-’ with stable outlook.   22. Ladies and gentlemen, while acknowledging that some critical issues remain to be addressed; our economy has witnessed a significant turnaround in the macro indicators. The restoration of macroeconomic stability should provide some basis for improved financial intermediation to boost economic activities in the near-term.   
 Page | 13   23. The stable macroeconomic environments occurred on the back of strong fiscal consolidation and prudent monetary policy providing an anchor to the disinflation process. In particular, improvements in interest rates are beginning to impact positively on availability of credit to households and the private sector to support growth.  24. In the course of the year, we experienced some headwinds from external sources on the domestic foreign exchange market, similar to many emerging markets. In particular, the shift to monetary policy normalisation in the U.S. led to rising yields and portfolio reversals especially in emerging markets, which triggered volatility in most currency markets. To a large extent, these pressures have moderated and the local currency has been relatively stable. The BoG will continue to carefully monitor the external environment and other related factors with the goal of ensuring stability in the currency.  25. The gains achieved in macroeconomic stability, together with implementation of other policy initiatives, will provide some impetus to economic growth. Banks, therefore, must position themselves to scale up their support for private sector-led growth.    
 Page | 14   What Next for the Banking Industry after Recapitalisation?  26. Madam President, as we take stock of what has become a very engaging past 18 months, allow me to share some perspectives on how we see developments in the banking sector in the coming year:   27. Even though we have made significant strides and seen improvements in the soundness and stability of the banking sector, there is still scope for improvement, especially from the financial sector stability and banking supervision perspectives. Our collective responsibility is to ensure efficient financial intermediation in the economy as we continue to provide assurances to the general public to address some of the confidence issues that arose during the clean-up. We should collectively work hard to regain the confidence of the general public through the introduction of prudent policies, regulations and procedures to ensure irreversibility of reforms introduced.  28. To this end, the Bank of Ghana will:    ● Enforce strict compliance with all Directives, including the Capital Requirement Directive (Pillar 1) of the Basel II Accord and the IFRS 9 reporting standard; ● Finalise implementation of Pillar II of the Basel II Accord; 
 Page | 15   ● Fully implement consolidated supervision alongside revisions to the Bank’s Risk-Based Supervision Framework, ● Enhance cooperation with other financial sector regulators and relevant foreign regulators;  ● Ensure that banks develop, adopt, and implement plans to scale up financial inclusion and sustainable banking efforts to support the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, deploying emerging technologies on the back of the new interoperability framework.  29. Underlying the regulatory agenda for 2019 is an approach that ensures that : ● Shareholders of banks and specialised deposit-taking financial institutions exercise control over these institutions not for the benefit of shareholders and related and connected parties, but primarily in the interest of depositors, creditors, employees, and other stakeholders; ● Boards are composed of persons that are capable of exercising the strong and independent oversight they are expected to ensure that the interests of all relevant stakeholders are protected; ● Risk management is integrated in the strategic focus of governance and management of these institutions; 
 Page | 16   ● Compliance with regulatory requirements and ethical standards are embedded in overall risk management; ● Our supervisory systems, processes, and teams are better able to identify early warning signs, enforce regulatory requirements and ensure that prompt corrective action is taken by banks to recover quickly from any signs of distress.  30. Madam President, while the recovery in the banking sector is on-going, pockets of distressed institutions in the Specialised Deposit-taking Institutions segment of the financial sector are emerging. These also require full attention, if the public is to regain trust in the whole financial setup. The Bank is monitoring these developments and working closely with the Ministry of Finance on a plan to resolve the issues with a view to restore trust and confidence in the entire financial system.  31. Madam President, in concluding, let me reiterate that we have a collective responsibility as bankers to ensure high ethical and professional standards in the industry. And, the public is counting on us to perform this role diligently to restore trust and confidence. It is my expectation that 2019 will bring good tidings to our industry, with fewer challenges as we continue to build a robust and resilient banking industry.

1  CURAÇAO FINANCIAL SECTOR: READY FOR 2019 AND BEYOND √   Speech delivered by Mrs. L. Matroos-Lasten Acting President Centrale Bank van Curaçao en Sint Maarten    On the occasion of the information session on Replacing the old Off-shore; Embracing the new Reality    Centrale Bank van Curaçao en Sint Maarten October 25, 2018     
2   Your Excellency: The Prime Minister of Curaçao, Mr. Eugene Rhuggenaath The Minister of Finance of Curaçao, Mr. Kenneth Gijsbertha Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, good evening.  There is a tendency to assume that stimulating growth and the strengthening of specific economic pillars is the sole responsibility of the government. However, as we have been recently experiencing in Curaçao, initiatives jointly undertaken by all key stakeholders are crucial to achieve the desired development and growth of an industry and/or an economic sector. While the private sector knows best the trends and needs, the role of the public sector is to create and safeguard the right investment climate and regulatory framework for businesses to operate, grow, and attract direct investment. The collective actions of the public and private sectors will certainly lead to sustainable economic growth and progress.   For that reason, the Centrale Bank van Curaçao en Sint Maarten, supports the initiatives and actions that CIFA and other stakeholders have been taking in due preparation of replacing the old offshore regime in favor of a new and more transparent (fiscal) framework, set to take effect in 2019. The theme of this information session, “Curaçao Financial Sector, Ready for 2019 and beyond” is fitting, given the developments in the international financial services industry.   Today, I would like to discuss the potential role of the Central Bank in this new reality starting 2019, but first, I would like to provide a short overview of the long history of Curaçao as a provider of international financial services and the international context in which we have been and are now operating.   Ladies and gentlemen, international financial services activities in Curaçao date back to the late 1930s. Although other countries in the region provided advantages such as being zero-tax havens, many companies ultimately chose Curaçao as the location to establish their business activities because of its political and economic stability, freedom of capital movements, the availability of a skilled labor-force, convenient location and communications, and the presence of related services 
3  including banking, legal, tax advisory, and audit. In addition, being part of the Dutch Kingdom was also an important advantage for establishing international financial services activities in Curaçao.  However, the prosperity of the international financial services sector came to a halt with the termination of the Tax Treaty with the United States, and the abolishment of the US Foreign Withholding Tax in 1985. Over the past two decades, the sector was also negatively affected by other developments, such as the negative connotation of offshore tax planning and increased bundling as tax-haven region. Furthermore, we have in the past failed to adapt quickly to market conditions, and to be innovative in terms of introduction of new products to increase the attractiveness and competitiveness of our jurisdiction.   Notwithstanding the gradual decline over the decades, the international financial services sector is still an important pillar of our economy as it directly contributes approximately 6 percent to GDP, and is an important generator of high-skilled jobs. Furthermore, over the past years, the sector contributed on average approximately 6 percent to foreign exchange receipts from the export of primarily services. Besides its direct contribution, the international financial services industry also has positive spillover effects to other related industries, including telecommunication services, transportation services and hospitality services.   Curaçao has taken several measures to meet international standards over the past years. One of the main measures taken, reason for which we are here today, was the enactment of a New Fiscal Regime to be in full compliance with the policies of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) for fair tax practices. The New Fiscal Framework became effective in 2002, and aimed to eliminate the difference between offshore and onshore designations. The New Fiscal Framework also stipulated that international companies established before 2002 were subjected to a special tax treaty until the year 2019. This transitional special treatment, also referred to as the grandfathering rule, ensured the orderly and smooth transition from the old offshore regime to the new fiscal regime. This grandfathering period, which will remain applicable until 2019, represents the old, and as we are entering the twilight stage of the grandfathering period, we are preparing to welcome new opportunities on the horizon. 
4  Ladies and Gentlemen, when we thought that we have seen it all, we are now witnessing the rapid development of a global digital economy. These innovative changes are shaking global financial services and service providers to their core. We all know the benefits that disruptive technologies and innovation can bring to consumers and our economy in terms of opening accessibility to a larger part of the global population to local providers of services. The current innovation revolution offers an opportunity for Curaçao to again take the pioneering lead in shaping the future of regional and global financial services provision. I cannot stress enough the importance of our need to become adaptable and agile to keep our markets efficient, fair, and attractive in an ever-evolving and innovative environment.  Today I want to touch upon the role of the Central Bank in promoting our jurisdictional readiness and embracing the new reality.   The Central Bank is responsible for the supervision of the financial sector of Curaçao and Sint Maarten, and is not exempted of the responsibility of ensuring integrity, continuity, and resilience of our markets. In our aim to preserve and foster the reputation of Curaçao as a sound, transparent, and reputable financial center, whilst taking advantage of the changing landscape, we worked to achieve institutional agility and adaptability needed to usher our financial sector into this new era.   While we believe that there is no substitute for good regulation, we are also aware that overregulation will impair the ability of our jurisdiction to maintain a competitive position as an international financial center. Therefore, a proper balance must be reached between the adequacy and effectiveness of rules and regulations, and the underlying risks that our financial sector is exposed to. Our efforts are directed towards complying with the international standards, but keenly taking advantage of the now presenting opportunities.   We have successfully and positively been assessed by the major standard-setting bodies over the past years such as the OECD, the IMF, the World Bank, and the (C)FATF, and subsequently, implemented their recommendations. Although complying with international standards and principles is a major achievement, we now need to turn our attention to capitalize on our enhanced transparency as a jurisdiction.  The collusion of our transition to a new fiscal framework with the current innovation developments is just what we need as a jurisdiction.  
5  Although the Central Bank is not a regulator for technology driven institutions, innovation is rapidly affecting and changing our regulatory landscape as well. Financial Technology or FinTech is now driving the financial business narrative in a way that regulators are now scrambling to determine how to regulate highly technological institutions and technology driven products.  The Central Bank has recently installed an innovation committee to explore the possibility to present Curaçao as the natural alternative for innovation-driven business. Regulatory innovation is not only a theoretical concept, but rather a necessity that the Central Bank is determined to explore. Curaçao has all the pre-requisites and the mindset to take the driver’s seat in this area, we now need to start the engine of the new, and all hop in to new heights in the international service provision.  In conclusion, Curaçao has traditionally been an attractive international financial services center, as we have always offered the advantages of compliance and optimal service. Therefore, I am confident to state that Curaçao can look forward to a promising 2019 and beyond. The Central Bank, as the supervisor of the financial services industry, is open for business as we tailor our regulatory framework to become a 21st century regulator, while meeting international standards to protect the interests of the international clients of our financial services industry.  Together we should strive to continuously explore new opportunities and develop appealing products, and henceforth, we need to keep re-inventing our entrepreneurial creativity.      A final note. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the check mark (√) and not the question mark (?) in the title: “Curaçao Financial Center: Ready for 2019 and beyond..”. Because I do share the sentiment that we are ready for the future and that together, we will be better beyond 2019. I thank you for your attention.  
      29 November 2018   Deputy Governor Rannveig Sigurðardóttir. Introductory remarks at the 2nd Annual Nordic Cyber in Finance Conference, Helsinki, 29 November 2018   Let me begin by saying that this conference is both timely and interesting for me, as I have only been in office for five months. Given that I come from the monetary policy department at the Central Bank of Iceland, cybersecurity has not been much on my agenda until now. It is, nonetheless, a very important topic. The Central Bank of Iceland, and other central banks are facing several new challenges in this area, both in the financial sector generally and central banking more specifically.  Last week I attended an interesting macroprudential policy conference at Danmarks Nationalbank. The discussion paper prepared for that conference was called While the sun is shining, prepare for a rainy day. Sitting there, I pondered what the discussion paper for this conference today might be called. Perhaps something like The snowstorm is here – what do we wear? Cybercrime is now the world’s fastest-growing type of crime. It has shot up to second place on the list of the top ten business risks worldwide, after not even making the list five years ago. The financial sector is particularly important because it greases the wheels of our economies, and cyber risks pose mounting threats to the financial system. Developments since the emergence of the internet show that new technologies have brought with them new challenges. We only need to think of robotics, artificial intelligence, blockchains, and smart phones with 5G Wi-Fi to realize the extent of the changes that lie ahead for financial services.  New technologies also bring opportunities. The Austrian economist, Finance Minister, and banker Joseph Schumpeter demonstrated in the 1920s that successive waves of technological change raise productivity, income, and living standards. However, we know from long experience that technological change often results in costs involving new risks that must be addressed in order to optimise the net benefit. So while FinTech 
  will broaden consumers’ range of choices in financial intermediation, it also brings new risks, both to the security of transactions and to privacy. To maintain financial stability and real economic activity, we need payment and settlement systems that are secure. As a result, cybersecurity has moved from being a technical issue to a central bank issue. That is why the Nordic central banks have set up this forum for discussion and cooperation so as to foster closer cooperation on cyber resilience and cybersecurity. Today the focus is on financial market infrastructure.  One of the questions being asked in this section of the conference is, “What challenges are likely to emerge with new operating models and new actors in the financial sector?” As I said before, the FinTech snowstorm is already here. The newest challenge with respect to cybersecurity is the emergence of new players offering financial services, some of whom have not provided financial services before. The question therefore becomes: What technology are they using? Is it established, or is it new and unknown technology? We also know that attitudes towards security and operational risk are important. But with tech firms rushing to offer new products to the market, there is the risk of insufficient emphasis on security. This is a risk that must be monitored – not only for new products or for new players, but also for incumbent businesses.  Tech giants like Google, Apple, and Alibaba look set to become dominant players. Their advantage comes from providing cross-border services and having already gathered significant information about users. They are already present in the Nordic marketplace. This development may lean towards monopolies, as it can create entry barriers for new and smaller players in the market. If that proves to be the case, it could have a negative impact on competition and go against the aims of the PSD2 (the recent EU Directive on payment services in the internal market (2015/2366). This risk is greater when the payment mechanisms are outside the jurisdiction of the relevant state.  Then there is the question of supervision. Will the new solutions be supervised, and if so, how? The challenge here is that many new solutions are global, and thus outside the European Economic Area or the European Single Market. Such supervision thus requires cross-border cooperation among supervisors. The challenge for the supervisor is also to maintain a comprehensive overview of the market. For the legislator, it is a challenge to stay on top of rapid technological developments, as rules tend to lag behind technological changes. Financial market participants must commit fully to guarding the system. Cybersecurity needs to be promoted at all levels. With respect to this fast-changing technology, keeping one step ahead of antisocial elements is a constant challenge. As I see it, cooperation is the only way forward. It is vital that all financial system entities work together on all fronts – within and between countries – to identify and address vulnerabilities. We need to share both our successes and our mishaps. We must do as mountain-climbers do – tie ourselves together 
  – because we are all in this together: central banks, financial service providers, FinTech firms, consumers, regulators, and politicians. And our success in combining forces will determine whether we reach the mountain peak or have to go back to base camp again. All systems can break. This is why some of us still use paper banknotes, even though they are not the most sophisticated technology. But their security has been improved upon over recent centuries. Try imagining what would have been the main topic at a conference in Florence at the time of the first Medici’s. As with paper money, the technologies we are discussing here today will become more secure, although we will encounter blizzards. Our role is to prevent or reduce the likelihood that those blizzards will create systemic risk.   





















  1  REMARKS BY THE SECOND DEPUTY GOVERNOR, MRS. ELSIE ADDO AWADZI, AT THE JOY FM FINANCIAL SECTOR FORUM ON NOVEMBER 1, 2018  Opening remarks  The stability and integrity of our financial system should be of utmost important to everyone and the economy as a whole. Banks and other institutions that take deposits are regulated to help ensure that they remain safe and sound to perform their critical role in the economy.   As you know the BoG has undertaken a number of reforms recently and continues to strengthen the system. I look forward to sharing some of these reforms with you, and to hearing your thoughts on the reform process so far and going forward.   Qs & As   Q. What is the current state of affairs in Ghana’s banking sector?   The banking sector is generally strong and continues to be profitable, judging from a number of key indicators. For example:    total assets continue to increase;  profitability remains high;  industry CAR of 19% compared to required minimum of 10%; and  the quality of bank loans continues to improve, with a reduction in NPLs.   Q.  BoG has carried out a number of reforms recently. Why is BoG finally cracking the whip after doing nothing for a long time  Indeed, BoG has initiated a number of reforms over the last year and half to make the banking sector stronger and more resilient. Key among these reforms are:   The revocation of licences of 7 failed banks, and the appointment of receivers for these banks; 
  2  Strengthening the regulatory framework through a number of new Directives on a number of key issues such as capital, corporate governance, provisioning for loans, and others;  A renewed focus on risk-based supervision of banks to help identify problems sooner than later;  Stronger enforcement of our Laws and Directives;  Increasing public awareness to help the banking public make prudent banking decisions.  BoG is committed to ensuring that banks and other financial institutions it regulates, remain safe and sound and engage in practices that protect the deposits of their clients as well as ensure that the financial system is safe and stable for all users. BoG has demonstrated this commitment by the bold steps it has taken so far, as difficult and painful as some of them have been.  Q.  Were the actions taken against the 7 defunct banks necessary? Why were they taken?   The BoG’s recent actions were necessary to ensure that banks that failed were made to exit the market in an orderly fashion and without disruptions to our financial system. Failed banks become serious sources of risk for the entire financial system and the economy as a whole, and must be made to exit before they collapse the whole system. What happens to the financial system affects everyone!   The defunct banks had reached a point where they were no longer able to operate as banks. 4 of the 7 had been found to be significantly undercapitalised as of the 2015/16, and subsequently became insolvent when their capital was further impaired due to bad loans and other irrecoverable assets.  The other 3 defunct banks obtained their licenses by false pretences through the use of suspicious and non-existent capital, which rendered them significantly undercapitalized compared to the minimum of GHS 120 mn they were required to have.    Underlying these failures were a pattern of poor corporate governance practices, insider dealings, misreporting, and other practices which put depositors’ funds at risk.  In taking these actions, BoG sought to:   protect the deposits (about GHS11 billion) held by these defunct banks;  ensure that these defunct banks exited the market in an orderly fashion without creating disruptions to the rest of the system; and  allow stronger institutions to operate and support the economy.  
  3 Q. What has been the impact of the BoG’s actions against the failed banks on the financial sector and beyond?   BoG’s actions against the failed banks and Government’s decision to guarantee the deposits of the 7 banks and the creation of CBG have helped to mitigate what could have been severe adverse consequences from these failures. When banks fail, there are usually a lot of casualties, which if not well managed could lead to significant problems for the financial sector and the economy.   The interventions of the BoG and MoF:   Protected about GHS 11 billion in customer deposits, including deposits and placements of other financial institutions (banks, savings and loans, RCBs, MFIs, insurance firms, securities firms and fund managers, and pension fund managers);   Minimized job losses by saving some 3,500 or 70% of appx 5000 employees of the defunct banks;  The banking sector reforms have boosted the confidence of local and international investors and other market players in the BoG’s role as regulator, and have contributed to the recent upgrades to Ghana’s credit rating from S&P from B- to B.   Q. The clean-up has been costly to the tax payer. How will this be recovered if at all?   The clean-up costs were necessary policy interventions to help mitigate the socio-economic impacts of the failure of the banks.    It is important that the costs of these interventions which were borne by taxpayers, are recovered to the extent possible through recoveries from debtors, shareholders, and related and connected parties who took money from the defunct banks.    The receivership processes are ongoing, and the receivers are making great strides in their recovery efforts. Amounts in excess of 400 Million Cedis have so far been recovered by the Receivers of the 2 banks closed last year.   Dossiers on all seven banks have been handed over to EOCO for investigations and possible prosecutions by relevant State agencies.   
  4  BoG’s own internal investigations into the conduct of Bank of Ghana officials have begun with the establishment of the Office of Ethics and Internal Investigations. Any officials (current and former) found culpable will neither be spared nor shielded by Management.  Q.  Any lessons so far?  Trust and confidence in the financial system are critical. As the saying goes, trust comes on foot and leaves on horseback! All parties must work towards preserving the trust that customers repose in them.  Q. What about the specialised Deposit-Taking Institutions Sector? There are signs of distress with some institutions not paying depositor claims. Is BoG planning to act against these institutions? If so, how soon? What are the estimated clean-up costs?  BoG continues to assess the condition of the SDI sector. Institutions that do not meet prudential requirements will be closed. BoG will ensure that any such action is managed carefully to mitigate any potentially adverse socio-economic impacts.  Q. What is next for BoG?  We are working with all stakeholders to rebuild confidence in our banking sector. There are great opportunities ahead for the industry to drive Ghana’s economic growth agenda, and we expect to see banks positioning themselves for these opportunities.    Following the new regulatory requirements we have introduced, we expect to see better capitalized banks, more transparency in the quality of assets held by banks, stronger corporate governance and risk management practices, and a new focus on maintaining the confidence of customers.    On our part, we are strengthening our regulatory and supervisory capacity through improved systems, processes, accountability, and training, to enable our supervision staff better monitor banks’ performance and conduct, and ensure that banks take prompt corrective action to address emerging risks.    We are moving ahead with implementation of the deposit protection scheme established under the Ghana Deposit Protection Act, 2016 (Act 931) as amended, to provide a safety net for vulnerable depositors in the event of a bank failure.  
  5 Q. What should be the structure of financial sector regulation going forward.  Currently, there are different regulatory agencies with mandates to regulate different parts of the financial sector. Each of these agencies have the requisite understanding of their respective sectors and should work on improving their own effectiveness as may be needed.   More cooperation is also needed among all the regulators. This will help ensure that each regulator has visibility on the other parts of the financial system and has a clear understanding of how their actions and the actions of their licensees affect other parts of the system and vice versa.    Closing remarks   Let me conclude by reassuring everyone that the BoG is carrying out the mandate it has under law to ensure the safety and soundness of banks and other deposit-taking institutions, to protect depositors’ funds, and to promote integrity and stability of the financial system.   BoG is committed to supporting the banks and other financial institutions that are playing by the rules of the game.   We are working together with all stakeholders to build a resilient banking sector that has the trust and confidence of everyone and that support the national economic growth agenda.  
    12.12.2018 Opening of the 14th banking industry meeting: should we reinvent banks or improve their management? IESE  Pablo Hernández de Cos Governor  

  3/11 Good morning. I should like to thank the IESE for its kind invitation to open the 14th edition of the banking industry meeting. This gives me an excellent opportunity to review the progress made by the Spanish banking industry and the main challenges it currently faces. Let me start, however, with a brief explanation regarding the content of my speech. As a member of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank I am, as of today, subject to a “quiet period”, before a meeting at which monetary policy decisions are due to be taken. Accordingly, my reflections in this speech should not be interpreted as indicating the monetary or economic outlook (see Chart 1). Following the last crisis, Spanish banks have carried out a major balance sheet clean-up, recapitalisation and restructuring which, over the last four and a half years, has notably improved the situation of the industry in terms of its basic parameters, such as asset quality, profitability and solvency.  Starting with asset quality, between December 2013 and June 2018 the reduction in non-performing loans and foreclosed real estate assets has been very notable. Also, the return on equity has turned positive again and is above the euro area average, following its collapse in 2012, to minus 25%. The total capital ratio, meanwhile, has increased by 1.7 percentage points over the last four years, and the leverage and liquidity ratios are above the European averages. Indeed, the recent stress tests carried out by the European Banking Authority (EBA) and the Banco de España show the considerable resilience of Spanish banks’ solvency under adverse scenarios. However, while recognising the significant progress made in recent years, the Spanish banking industry continues to face significant challenges, which are largely shared by other euro area banking systems. Notable among them are: i) the need for further progress in reducing unproductive assets which remain at high levels; ii) raising profitability; iii) strengthening the industry’s reputation by preventing misconduct; iv) adapting to the new regulatory framework and strengthening the highest-quality capital ratios; and v) competing in a new financial environment arising from technological progress and the emergence of new players (see Chart 2).  Reducing unproductive assets As I have already said, the reduction in non-performing loans and foreclosed assets from the peak levels they reached during the crisis has been significant. Private-sector non-performing loans, which have fallen by 60% from their peak in 2013, currently stand at the same level as in 2009. Foreclosed assets have followed a similar pattern, falling by 40% from their peak in 2012. The economic recovery has certainly contributed to this process, but it has also been driven by credit institutions’ management of troubled assets and by supervisory pressure.  Spain has made relatively more progress than other euro area countries in reducing the volume of non-performing loans built up during the crisis. Moreover, economic growth – albeit at lower rates – can be expected to continue to help to gradually reduce them over the next few years. Despite these improvements, the level of unproductive assets of Spanish banks (especially those related to business in Spain) remains relatively high and above pre-crisis levels.  
 4/11  Reducing unproductive assets continues to be a challenge for the industry, requiring banks to strengthen the application of active management policies to their impaired assets. In this respect, the agreements to sell troubled asset portfolios announced over the past year will accelerate the reduction of future NPL ratios more than initially estimated solely on the basis of the cyclical improvement in the economy and the experience of previous credit cycles.  In order to address this challenge, which most other European banks also face, the European economic and supervisory authorities have taken initiatives to accelerate the reduction of NPLs. In particular, the European Commission announced a package of measures in March this year, which included a proposal to review the capital requirement regulations and an NPL provisioning schedule.  Correcting the high level of impaired assets is key for two basic reasons. First, because the balance-sheet clean-up will improve banks’ profitability and solvency. That is to say, it will free up resources currently devoted to financing unproductive assets and allow them to be used to finance new lending. And second, because correcting the levels of bad debts in the euro area should smooth the path to creation of a pan-European, fully mutualised deposit guarantee scheme with sufficient fiscal backing, since it would enable risks to be shared without problems inherited from before the establishment of the Single Supervisory and Resolution Mechanisms. This is the third pillar of the Banking Union, a key element which seeks, moreover, to reduce the link between banking risk and sovereign risk (see Chart 3). Restoring profitability Restoring profitability is another of the main challenges facing the Spanish banking industry. Although it has returned to positive values (7% in June 2018), and stands above the EU average, profitability remains below pre-crisis levels and, in any case, below the levels in other developed-economy banking systems. The low average profit levels generated by Spanish banks are especially apparent in their business in Spain. In addition, the international activity of Spanish banks, which entailed significant diversification of risk and a valuable source of profits during the crisis, has its own challenges. Some of the emerging market economies to which Spanish banks are exposed – such as Turkey and Argentina – are currently in considerable difficulty.  That said, I should like to point out that geographical diversification of banks is a source of value added and of medium and long-term stability and is relevant to any assessment of profitability and risk for two reasons. First, because the correlation of activity between countries may be negative. This has historically been the case for many of the emerging countries in which Spanish banks have international activity. Second, the characteristics of the banking markets in which they operate (much more concentrated, and with less banking penetration) are conducive to the existence of higher margins (see Chart 4). Returning to the profitability of the banking business in Spain, its comparatively low level is explained by a variety of factors. First, as I have already mentioned, the high volume of unproductive assets has a direct negative impact on banks’ income statements by reducing interest income and increasing impairment provisioning. Second, low profitability is also explained by the significant fall in income associated with banks’ deleveraging. In addition, the current levels of interest rates have squeezed banks’ 
  5/11 net interest income. That said, the ECB’s monetary policy has also had a positive effect on economic activity (thus reducing the losses from loan defaults) and on banks’ capital gains. In short, the ultimate net impact of low interest rates on bank profitability seems to have been smaller than that of the other factors I have mentioned. As regards operating expenses, they remain on the downward trend seen in recent years. This containment of expenses is taking place against a background of adjustment of the operating capacity of Spanish banks and has basically taken the form of a significant reduction in the numbers of staff and branches in their business in Spain. The adjustment of the productive capacity of the Spanish banking system has already lasted ten years, the number of branches having been reduced by more than 40% from its peak in 2008, while staff numbers have fallen by more than 30%. In this scenario, in which extraordinary growth in total lending is not expected in the short or medium term, efforts to restore profitability should be based on adjusting expenses to the new size of balance sheets, seeking alternative sources of income and improving efficiency.  That said, we must remember that the search for profitable business cannot be at the expense of the necessary vigilance of credit conditions. This basic premise is a necessary condition for the appropriate management of credit risk. I wish to point this out because we are seeing high rates of growth in bank lending to households for the acquisition of consumer durables (15% year-on-year in September 2008, after rates of more than 20% in previous quarters) and, what is more symptomatic, the default rate associated with this activity has already begun to accelerate significantly. This situation suggests that there has been some easing of the risk acceptance and selection standards in this segment. It is vital that the lessons of the crisis not be forgotten here: past experience has shown that loosening credit standards eventually leads to notable increases in default rates.  Although the weight of this business segment in the lending of Spanish banks as a whole is low, the growth observed should be a warning sign. It would not be acceptable for the search for an alternative source of income in the short term to become once again a potential source of future losses.  In this respect, price-setting policies at product or service level are fundamental to ensure an appropriate risk-adjusted profitability. These policies must be consistent, comprehensive and rigorous to ensure that the price charged for a product or service covers at least its total cost, including the risk premium inherent in each type of transaction.  From the viewpoint of appropriate risk management, controlling the risks incurred, assessing how they develop over time and applying conservative conditions when negotiating the rollover of loans are basic elements of credit standards that banks must observe and keep up to date in their policies. Moreover, from the viewpoint of customer protection, the appropriate assessment of their solvency and capacity to repay is also protection against future vulnerabilities (see Chart 5).  
 6/11  Reputation and conduct One of the largest challenges facing banks today is precisely that of managing one of their main assets: their reputation, which is fundamental to generate the appropriate framework of trust within which to develop customer relations. The reputation of banks was eroded during the last crisis, not only as a result of management failures in part of the system, but also as a result of inappropriate marketing to customers, which undermined their trust. In fact, the number of complaints by customers to banks’ customer complaints services increased almost six-fold between 2014 and 2017. This has led to growing concern about conduct risk in the social, political and supervisory domains, and naturally in the industry itself. This concern is also shared internationally, as reflected in the recent work of the Financial Stability Board to strengthen the governance and remuneration frameworks in order to mitigate the risk of misconduct. The Banco de España strengthened its supervisory activity in relation to conduct four years ago. This greater supervisory presence, along with regulatory requirements, the need to adapt to new and more demanding customers and judicial rulings in defence of consumers, is prompting banks to react, and they are making efforts to implement the measures needed to correct these practices. However, much remains to be done. Banks must be more proactive in developing a strong culture that is not only oriented towards complying with customer transparency regulations, but also fundamentally towards identifying and satisfying customer interests. This requires the involvement and commitment of governing bodies and the spread of these values throughout the institution; especially to the sales network, which must have an incentive mechanism that does not give rise to perverse or counter-productive incentives. In short, banks must incorporate the customer protection perspective into their risk appetite framework, making it a cornerstone of their governance and decision-making processes.  For this process to be successful, the control of regulatory compliance in the marketing and management of banking products and services needs to be strengthened. And, simultaneously, the role of customer service departments needs to be bolstered, with the focus not only on improving the treatment of complaints, but also on ensuring that they serve as an alert mechanism for conduct risks, so that managers are promptly aware of the areas of customer relations giving rise to conflict or dissatisfaction. Thus, a comprehensive approach to customer relations is required. A satisfied customer is one of the main assets of any bank and the basis for sustained profitability (see Chart 6). Adapting to the new regulatory framework and strengthening solvency I shall now turn to the fourth important challenge facing the Spanish banking industry: adapting to the new regulatory framework. I will start with one of the elements introduced in the context of Basel III: the inclusion of macro-prudential tools to supplement micro-prudential regulation and supervision.  
  7/11 From a financial stability perspective, providing supervisors with macro-prudential tools would allow them to better adjust financial expansions, on the one hand cushioning the impact of contractions and, on the other, helping financial institutions to continue to perform their function of financing the real economy in times of tension. The arsenal of macro-prudential tools has indeed been expanded significantly since the financial crisis. Apart from the countercyclical capital buffer, we have the systemic risk buffer, the buffers for global and local systemically important banks, the possibility to limit excessive risk concentrations, to increase capital requirements and to review the risk weighted assets for real estate exposures. These tools will allow us supervisors to develop macro-prudential policies that interact with micro-prudential policies and monetary policy. However, creating macro-prudential tools is not sufficient. To ensure their effectiveness, they must be appropriately assigned from an institutional point of view to avoid so-called inaction bias. In this respect, the Spanish Government has announced that a macro-prudential authority is to be set up, composed of representatives of the Ministry of the Economy and Enterprise, the Banco de España and the National Securities Market Commission. Spain was one of the few European countries still without a national macro-prudential authority. By setting up this new authority, Spain is complying with the recommendation of the European systemic risk board, which urged EU Member States to establish such an authority. The aim of this authority will be to carry out the macro-prudential supervision of the Spanish financial system, in order to contribute to the prevention or mitigation of systemic risk. For this purpose, the Banco de España is due to be given new powers in this area. These include, notably, the possibility of activating tools, such as the sectoral countercyclical capital buffer, limiting sectoral credit concentration and others relating to credit standards. Giving the Banco de España these new macro-prudential tools clearly strengthens the Spanish supervisory system and brings it into line with best international practice. Macro-prudential policy is especially important in a country like Spain, which belongs to a monetary union and a banking union, since – as we have seen in the past – the financial and business cycles of the various countries that make up the currency are not always harmonised with those of the euro area as a whole.  Considering that the euro area has a common monetary policy and supervisory policy and that there is limited scope for fiscal policy measures, macro-prudential policy has a fundamental role to play in addressing the credit cycle.  I will now move on to institutions’ adaptation to the other components of the international regulatory reform such as stricter requirements for own funds and liquid assets, and other requirements under the new resolution legislation. These regulatory changes were agreed at international level in response to the shortcomings that became apparent when the financial crisis broke out ten years ago now. Their aim is to boost banking systems’ resilience to adverse shocks, and to minimise the cost to taxpayers in the event of resolution. In other words, they seek to reduce the likelihood of future financial crises, and if they do happen, reduce their impact on society. 
 8/11  The first phase of the reforms, agreed between 2010 and 2011, focused, among other things, on strengthening the quantity and quality of banks’ capital and introducing new liquidity requirements and limits on credit concentration. Almost all of these requirements will have come into force by the end of 2019. Subsequently, December 2017 saw the completion of the second phase of reforms in the Basel III framework. Among other things these reforms introduced enhancements to the standardised methods for calculating credit and operational risk, restrictions on the use of internal models and changes in the leverage ratio.  These changes will be implemented in two phases, due to be completed in 2027.  As regards bank resolution, the common European resolution framework defines the situations in which failing banks must be subject to liquidation or resolution. For this purpose a new category of non-preferred debt instruments has been created, ranked below senior debt in the order of priority of creditors to facilitate compliance with minimum requirements for the own funds and eligible liabilities available to absorb losses.  The Single Resolution Board has started to establish the requirements for these liabilities for European significant institutions and they will gradually be extended to less significant institutions. Smaller Spanish institutions tend basically to be funded via capital and deposits rather than by tapping capital markets. While this feature generally gives their liabilities greater stability, it means they have lower levels of eligible liabilities and a more limited pool of investors, with possible difficulties accessing non-preferred debt markets.  Lastly, issuance of this type of instrument is likely to have a much bigger impact on the cost of funding for medium-sized Spanish institutions than for larger ones. This is due to the difficulties accessing markets I mentioned earlier, in conjunction with the higher liquidity premia potential investors are likely to demand. As can be seen, the regulatory reforms are far-reaching and it is worth anticipating their impact as, although Spanish banks have largely adapted to the regulatory changes, application of some reforms is still outstanding. Although the total capital ratio has risen by 1.7 percentage points over the last four years (reaching 15.1% in June 2018, exceeding the regulatory minimum), and the leverage and liquidity ratios are slightly above their European averages, when we focus on the regulatory capital with greatest loss-absorbing capacity, i.e. ordinary capital or CET1, the ratio has risen by just 0.3 percentage points.  In this regard, the Banco de España’s in-house stress tests to assess prospectively the level of solvency of the Spanish banking system revealed that institutions have a high degree of resilience to possible adverse macroeconomic scenarios. Nevertheless, in view of the dispersion of results across banks and the possibility that the risks which materialise exceed those envisaged in the adverse scenario, banks would be advised to strengthen their capital insofar as the recovery in profits allows. Indeed, according to June 2018 data from the European Banking Authority, Spanish institutions’ CET1 and Tier 1 solvency ratios are some of the lowest among the euro area’s banking systems. Apart from the need to adopt strategies to strengthen their top quality capital shown by comparison across Europe, Spanish banks also need to: (i) take advantage 
  9/11 of the current economic growth and recovery in profits to raise levels of solvency and generate operating margin with which to meet the economy’s future credit demand in a stable way; (ii) anticipate the impact of the reforms pending implementation in the framework of Basel III; and (iii) ensure compliance with the resolution requirements without excessive dependence on the market’s appetite to absorb new non-preferred debt instruments (see Chart 7).  The new competitive environment However, beyond the difficulties of adapting to post-crisis regulation and restoring banks’ balance-sheet and income statement quality, the biggest challenge being faced by the Spanish banking sector is the new competitive framework in which it operates, and in particular, that deriving from new technologies and the advance of financial disintermediation. In this new competitive environment, both BigTechs and FinTechs are altering some of the traditional paradigms of retail banking, in particular, the traditional role of customer accounts in building loyalty and as the essential pillar on which to offer universal banking services. These new operators can leverage the opportunities offered by technology and the new payments regulation to offer their value-added services using the “basic” deposit-taking and account-management service platform provided by the banking system.  This scenario represents both a short-term challenge, insofar as new competitors may enter specific areas, such as retail payment services, with the consequent drop in business and income for banks in this area, and, fundamentally, a major future challenge deriving from the risk that banks may be relegated to providing undifferentiated and low value-added basic services. Against this competitive background, banks have a number of initial advantages but are being forced to react in order to capitalise on the opportunities the new situation offers. The responses may range from specialisation to digital transformation, taking advantage of the possibilities offered by technology and the new regulations, with an emphasis on adequate data management. In any event, this transition will entail a short-term increase in costs in a context of low profitability. Issues such as cybersecurity also take on particular significance in the process of adaptation of institutions to new technologies as they can also lead to an increase in operational and reputational risk. I would also like to highlight the growing challenge BigTech firms are posing in the financial sector, not in their more prominent customer-facing facet, but as providers of a significant amount of financial-sector infrastructure in areas such as cloud-based services. These actors now constitute a critical component of the financial sector. In any event, new technologies offer banks fresh opportunities, both in terms of business and potential efficiency gains. The application of artificial intelligence and the use of large databases with real-time information (Big Data) may also provide for significant efficiency gains in terms of both business activity and regulatory compliance. 
 10/11  Similarly, the use of new technologies in the financial sector may offer advantages to society in that it reduces intermediation costs, improves households’ and SMEs’ access to finance and facilitates financial inclusion (see Chart 8). Financial disintermediation Another factor making the environment in which credit institutions operate more competitive is the advance of financial disintermediation. In Spain, as in countries such as Germany and Italy, the bulk of non-financial corporations’ borrowing has traditionally come from bank loans. However, in other countries, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, capital markets play a much bigger role in corporate finance. There is no consensus as to the optimal financing structure to best ensure financial stability and economic growth. On the one hand, it is true that the interaction between companies and banks involves the handling of non-public information about companies that may facilitate their access to bank lending at lower cost. On the other hand, having liquid and efficient financial markets makes it possible to channel households’ savings into long-term projects with a larger share of finance in the form of capital.  Also, although the experience of the recent international crisis has taught us that an appropriate diversification of companies’ sources of financing reduces their vulnerability to shocks affecting bank lending channels, there is also evidence that capital markets are more procyclical. These issues take on special importance in the context of the potential increase in long-term saving associated with population ageing. In any event, in recent years companies have increasingly turned to European capital markets for finance. This trend towards financial disintermediation is explained by factors such as the ECB's corporate debt purchase programme, along with more permanent factors such as the introduction of new international banking regulation in response to the financial crisis. The primary aim of the regulatory reform is to foster financial stability by strengthening banks’ resilience to future shocks, but it has the side-effect of creating incentives to move typical bank services outside the reach of the sector’s safety nets. Indeed, various analytical studies –including the annual FSB non-banking financial intermediation monitoring reports– suggest that fund managers’ business has grown substantially over the past decade. Moreover, this growth has been observed particularly in the case of open-ended funds that offer their unit-holders daily reimbursements and which invest in assets that are somewhat illiquid or have long maturities. In other words, they perform activities that share the need to manage some of the risks characteristic of typical banking business, such as maturity transformation, leverage or liquidity risk. I therefore feel international financial regulation needs to follow the principle that activities with similar risks should be subject to similar supervision and regulation. And in the supervision and regulation of all entities and activities, the risks they pose to the financial system, particularly those of systemic importance, must be taken into account. Looking beyond the regulatory viewpoint, the trend towards greater development of the capital markets could be further encouraged if headway is made in creating a Capital 
  11/11 Markets Union which, together with the culmination of Banking Union, would allow a better allocation of risk within the Economic and Monetary Union. These changes in the structure of financial markets, in conjunction with the emergence of new technologies, clearly represent a challenge for banks, particularly in the current context of low profits among Europe’s banking systems. In any event, at this point in time the ultimate impact of new technologies on the structure of the financial system is highly uncertain, as it will depend on various factors, including the future regulatory treatment of new players. Conclusions To conclude, Spanish credit institutions have improved significantly in terms of their solvency, profitability and asset quality in recent years.  Despite this progress, the Spanish banking sector still faces important challenges, challenges which it largely shares with other euro area banking systems. The most significant of these challenges are: (i) stepping up the pace of sales of unproductive assets; (ii) strengthening capital and liabilities suitable for internal recapitalisation; (iii) building the sector's reputation by avoiding the risk of inappropriate conduct; (iv) confronting the challenge of making profits without undue easing of lending standards; and (v) utilising new technologies, which are both a major challenge for the sector and an opportunity for institutions that can harness them. Additionally, challenges in the regulatory and supervisory area persist, such as the full integration of macro-prudential tools in economic policy design, and ensuring a regulatory framework that guarantees that typical banking risks are treated similarly regardless of the legal nature of the entity originating and managing them. In short, both institutions and the supervisory community share the challenge for the future of ensuring a more stable financial system that offers better services to society. Thank you very much.     
    14.12.2018 Economic policy: the challenge of future crises Speech by the Governor of the Banco de España at the Barcelona Círculo de Economía to mark ten years since the Lehman Brothers collapse Pablo Hernández de Cos Governor        

  3/14 I wish to start by thanking the Barcelona Círculo de Economía for their kind invitation to be here with you today, to close this cycle of lectures organised to mark the tenth anniversary of the collapse of Lehman Brothers. The economic and financial crisis was attributable to a broad and complex range of factors, but there is no doubt that this event remains engraved on the collective memory as a moment of particular significance, marking in a way the symbolic start of the crisis. The past decade has provided us with numerous lessons for the future, in particular in the area of economic policy management. Today, in order to identify outstanding tasks, I am going to devote my speech to a review of the changes that have occurred during these years, both at international and national level, which determine our ability to prevent the emergence of new crises or to mitigate their effects should they materialise. I shall start with the reforms at international level, in particular in the global financial architecture, and the risks arising from protectionism, the intensification of which may have significant negative effects on world growth in the medium term. I will then address the changes in euro governance, before moving on to discuss the role played in recent years by monetary policy. Finally, I will focus on the case of Spain, to briefly review the events of the last few years and then outline the main challenges facing the public finances, supply-side policies and the banking industry.  Progress on institutional design and supra-national economic policies and their challenges  Reform of the international financial system At international level, the global financial crisis highlighted the need for far-reaching reform of the regulatory and supervisory frameworks. The efforts made in recent years in this area have given economic policymakers updated instruments and new tools with which to address future risks relating to the financial system, its stability and its relationship with the economy as a whole. Thus, right from the early stages of the crisis, the G20 set in motion a series of reforms covering a number of areas, including microprudential and macroprudential banking regulation, international accounting standards and the regulation and monitoring of non-banking sectors, among other measures. We are currently in the phase of assessing the suitability of all these new instruments, some of which are still to be tested in crisis situations. In the microprudential domain, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision undertook a far-reaching review of the regulatory framework, which would become known as “Basel III”, with the aim of increasing the resilience of the banking system and reducing the impact of financial crises on the economy. Some of the key reforms introduced include an increase in the quantity and quality of minimum regulatory capital and the creation of capital buffers. New prudential requirements have also been introduced, such as the limits on large exposures, a maximum leverage ratio and two liquidity requirements, at the same time as the reform of the frameworks for evaluating market risk and securitisations has been launched.  In addition, last December, a second wave of reforms introduced within the framework of the Basel Accords was completed. The focus of these measures has been the calculation 
 4/14  of risk-weighted assets, i.e. the denominator of the capital ratio, in order to improve the comparability of capital ratios across banks and jurisdictions.  Another lesson of the crisis was that it is necessary to prevent and mitigate the effects of an excessive build-up of risk in the financial system as a whole. An exclusively microprudential based regulatory framework is clearly not sufficient to achieve this. New instruments were considered necessary to help moderate and address cyclical systemic risks (such as, for example, those associated with the credit cycle) and cross-sectional systemic risks (for example, those linked to the risk arising from, among other aspects, the size, complexity and density of the interconnections between financial institutions). With regard to cyclical systemic risks, a countercyclical capital buffer has been introduced, with a view to preventing risks arising from excessive credit growth at the aggregate level. As for cross-sectional systemic risks, the Financial Stability Board promoted a set of measures to strengthen the capital requirements for systemic banks and to establish stricter supervisory requirements and stronger resolution frameworks for them.  The development of microprudential policy also entailed changes of an institutional nature. In Europe, the European Systemic Risk Board was created, with the task of microprudential supervision of the financial system of the European Union (EU). However, at the same time it was necessary to create a framework for action at national level to enable the different sources of systemic risk to be monitored and the adequacy of the new macroprudential policy matters and instruments available to be assessed.  Following this roadmap, the Spanish Government has recently announced its intention to create a macroprudential authority comprising representatives of the Ministry of the Economy and Enterprise, the Banco de España and the National Securities Market Commission. This new authority will be responsible for the macroprudential supervision of the Spanish financial system, with the aim of contributing to the prevention and mitigation of systemic risk.  The crisis also highlighted certain vulnerabilities in the international accounting standards, resulting in the provisions needed to cover risks being recognised late and being inadequate in amount. In response, an expected loss accounting model was introduced, which, along with the reforms in the prudential area, helped improve recognition of credit risk and increasing the resilience of banks to unexpected deterioration in their credit portfolios. However, the reforms were not only intended to bolster resilience and alerts in the face of shocks and sources of risk, but also to promote the development of effective resolution mechanisms. This sought to address the problem known as “too big to fail”, a problem that became obvious during the crisis, when the authorities of various countries were forced to use public funds to rescue banks, owing to the serious consequences that their insolvency might have had on the rest of the financial system and on the economy as a whole.  With regard to resolution, a number of principles have been developed in order to guarantee the orderly management of banks in severe difficulties. These include the development of a bail-in tool to permit an orderly resolution process that minimises the impact on financial stability, ensures the continuity of critical bank functions and minimises the need for public funds.  
  5/14 Apart from the reforms I have mentioned, the G20 promoted stricter regulation and closer monitoring of the activity of non-bank financial intermediaries. The aim was to improve the monitoring of developments in this sector, and to assess which regulatory instruments should be used, taking into account the risks these intermediaries pose to financial stability. These risks may, in certain circumstances, have similar consequences to those traditionally assumed banks. The measures I have mentioned have generally led to a healthier, more resilient and diversified financial system, without adverse effects on the provision of credit to the economy. In particular, since 2011, the large international banks have almost doubled their highest quality capital, from $2 trillion to $3.7 trillion in 2017. Moreover, since the start of the crisis, they have halved their leverage and improved their liquidity profiles, mainly thanks to an increase in high-quality liquid assets. Progress has also been made in other areas, such as simplifying and boosting transparency in the OTC derivative markets, including through the use of central clearinghouses, and measures have been taken to reduce some of the risks arising from non-bank financial intermediation. Nonetheless, we cannot ignore the persistence of certain risks and vulnerabilities. First, although large banks are now less leveraged, overall debt levels remain very high. Global public-sector and non-financial private-sector debt has increased by some 40 percentage points (pp) since the financial crisis to reach 250% of global gross domestic product (GDP); public-sector debt has increased significantly in the advanced economies and private-sector debt in the emerging economies, especially in China. Second, there has been an increase in the weight of non-bank financing. The weight of other financial intermediaries (OFIs)1 in the global financial system has been growing in recent years, and reached 30% in December 2016, according to the latest data available. This trend is confirmed by the growth in non-bank financial intermediation, which generates similar risks to banking; its weight in the global financial industry increased from 11.6% in 2010 to 13.4% in 2016. These trends may have potentially important implications for the functioning and resilience of financial markets, in particular at times of stress.  Third, a number of challenges remain relating to implementation of some of the approved reforms, in particular the latest package of Basel III reforms agreed in December 2017.  Finally, now is the time to assess whether the approved reforms are effective and to identify any unintended consequences. In this respect, the FSB is due to launch an assessment of the policies agreed to address the too-big-to-fail problem next year. Reviewing globalisation and world trade rules                                                                                               1 The FSB defines OFIs by exclusion. This is not a statistical definition, therefore, since it covers various categories of the national financial accounts: all non-bank intermediaries other than the central bank, public institutions, insurance entities, pension funds and financial auxiliaries.  
 6/14  The political and social consequences of the crisis have had an impact on economic policy in the area of trade policy, at global level. Trade tensions and the proliferation of protectionist measures are one of the worst legacies of the economic policy response of some countries in the current post-crisis period. In fact, protectionism is currently a significant risk factor for world trade, and given the latest developments, we cannot rule out further escalation of such tensions, with severe consequences for global growth.  There is a broad consensus in the academic literature on the economic costs of protectionism. In the short and medium term, economies subject to protectionist measures suffer reductions in exports and investment, with resulting adverse effects on their activity.  Also, the effects on economies that adopt protectionist measures are far from positive, owing to the increase in the price of their imports, which, in turn, leads to an increase in production costs for their businesses and lower purchasing power for households, which leads to adverse effects on private consumption and investment. In addition, the uncertainty associated with trade tensions and the possible tightening of financial conditions may discourage investment further and worsen the negative impact on activity and potential growth. The estimates of the main international organisations in relation to the recent trade tensions between the United States and China suggest that the measures currently in force will have a relatively moderate impact (less than 0.5 pp of GDP in China and the United States, with an even smaller effect on global GDP). However, the application of tariffs and additional non-tariff measures, such as those announced by these two major powers, along with the foreseeable deterioration in confidence and in the financial markets to which this scenario could give rise, would involve much higher costs. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), it could, over three years, subtract nearly one percentage point from world GDP, with a more pronounced impact on China (-1.5 pp) and on the United States (-1 pp) than on other areas, such as the euro area, where the losses would be somewhat less than 0.5 pp. Another particularly relevant case at the present juncture is Brexit, which may have very significant effects on the UK and EU economies. Depending on the future framework for relations between the EU and the United Kingdom, and whether or not the departure from the EU takes place in an orderly manner, the latest estimates, published by the Bank of England just a few days ago, range from long-term GDP losses for the United Kingdom of around 2% of GDP in the case of an orderly exit and favourable future agreement, to declines of around 10% of GDP if there is no agreement and the exit is disruptive and disorderly. The costs for the EU would be lower, although in the event of a hard Brexit the impact could be significant for those countries with closer trade and financial ties with the United Kingdom, such as Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands.  At the same time, the evidence suggests that greater protectionism raises the vulnerability of economies to domestic adverse shocks. This is because international trade allows producers to diversify their business and cope with cyclical fluctuations in domestic demand. This diversification mechanism is even more important in crisis periods, as seen in Spain, where businesses facing severe contractions in domestic demand during the most recessionary phases of the last crisis found an escape valve in the form of exports that enabled them to maintain their activity and limit job losses.  
  7/14 It should also be noted that the negative effects of protectionism tend to grow stronger over the long term, owing to the damaging impact of trade barriers on competition, productivity, technological innovation and potential growth.  In the present context, characterised by the risk of heightened trade tensions, the review of the world trade negotiation rules and reform of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), the legal basis for the main trade exchanges in recent decades, are of even greater consequence. In fact, from a broader perspective, the latest political reactions against free trade come on top of a deeper, pre-existing crisis in the multilateral trade system. The security provided by trade rules enabled average tariffs between the United States, Europe and Japan to be cut from 22% in 1948 to 3% in 2000. However, in the latest round of negotiations between the WTO member countries, which took place in Doha in 2001, very little progress was made and structural problems currently affecting this system became apparent. These include, notably, the requirement for unanimity among the 164 members of the organisation for the approval of new provisions and the existence of a body of rules that has proved to be inadequate to manage the variety of challenges raised by China’s joining the WTO in 2001.  A possible way out of the current crisis in the system of rules for world trade and the WTO that has been recently discussed would involve moving from a multilateral system based on unanimity to a more flexible approach. This would allow resolutions to be adopted in particular areas by a limited number of countries, with the possibility of other economies joining them at a later stage. This multilateral approach could also be used to approve reforms to adapt the WTO rules to the recent changes in the world economy and thus restore global confidence in a system of trade based on respect for clear well-defined rules, curbing the proliferation of protectionist measures and boosting global growth in the long term.  The need to promote the opening up of trade in services, where the potential gains are still substantial, should also be mentioned. Lastly, in the domestic policy realm, the authorities need to adopt a number of policies (boosting labour market flexibility, solid social security networks and education and training opportunities) to satisfactorily address the distribution of the potential benefits of trade among different population groups.  The new institutional architecture for the euro  One of the structural elements that has changed most as a result of the combined financial-sovereign crisis in Europe is the institutional architecture of the euro area. The financial crisis revealed a number of shortcomings and deficiencies in various aspects of the design of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), such as the absence of fiscal stabilisation mechanisms for the area as a whole, the lack of crisis management instruments and the incoherence of the supervisory arrangements and of national bank resolution, while there was a manifest need for progress towards genuine financial integration as a logical consequence of the monetary union. We should recall here the weakness of the euro area’s cross-country risk-sharing mechanisms based on the capital markets and banking system, especially in comparison with other currency areas of a similar size, such as the United States. 
 8/14  Especially since the emergence of the sovereign debt crisis, in the first part of the current decade, these shortcomings have prompted significant progress in reform of the European institutional architecture, including the strengthening of the mechanisms for surveillance of the fiscal and macroeconomic imbalances and the creation of the European Stability Mechanism, the Single Supervisory Mechanism and the Single Resolution Mechanism.  Despite these reforms, significant limitations persist that require further EMU deepening. First, the second pillar of the banking union needs to be completed by means of the creation of a common backstop for the Single Resolution Fund to guarantee its financial sufficiency. Moreover, it is essential to launch a European deposit insurance scheme to ensure the same level of protection for all depositors throughout the euro area, reducing the risk of bank runs in situations of financial stress and to weaken the “doom loop” between sovereign risk and bank risk.  In relation to resolution, in line with international initiatives, the European resolution directive stipulates a minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities in the event of resolution. The application of this directive poses a number of challenges, in particular in terms of the transition towards compliance with these new requirements by banks, which I shall refer to later when discussing Spanish banks. Also, as the IMF has recently indicated, it would be desirable to assess the suitability of bail-in strategies in the event of systemic crises, given their potentially adverse effects on the financial system as a whole, which may ultimately raise social losses and the cost to the taxpayer. In order to make further progress in reducing the risk of financial fragmentation within the euro area, it is necessary to boost private-sector risk-sharing channels, such as the credit and capital market channels, so that they work alongside the public-sector risk-sharing mechanisms. This requires, first, removing obstacles to the creation in the medium term of genuine pan-European retail banks. In particular, a single deposit insurance fund needs to be created, the euro area needs to be treated as a single jurisdiction for regulatory purposes and, above all, market pressure needs to reach broad segments of the European banking system, such as public-sector banks, cooperative banks and savings banks.  Second, progress needs to be made on the various Capital Markets Union initiatives. The implementation of this project should lead to more efficient and integrated capital markets, enabling European businesses to diversify and broaden their sources of funding and to reduce their excessive dependence on bank finance. However, this is a complex objective that requires action on various fronts, including the development of market infrastructures, the review and harmonisation of market regulation and supervision and of insolvency procedures, and the elimination of the bias in favour of debt financing in some countries’ tax systems.  It is also necessary to move towards a fiscal governance framework that allows the stabilising capacity of fiscal policy in the euro area in times of crisis to be increased. For this purpose, countries should take advantage of the current upswing to generate scope for stabilisation in future crises, since national fiscal policy will continue to be the first line of defence. 
  9/14 In fact, a fiscal union, with shared responsibility for macro-financial risks that are already subject to common supervision, besides improving incentives would be conducive to the sustainability of public finances and macroeconomic stability in the area. However, clear, strict fiscal rules are also necessary for the Member States. Simplification of the complex web of rules and procedures that currently make up the Stability and Growth Pact, more automatic rules and stronger independent fiscal institutions, as well as a stronger European Fiscal Board, could also help achieve this objective. Also, the development of a common fiscal capacity that enables an aggregate fiscal stance to be defined and applied in the area would supplement the scope for national fiscal action and, as I have already mentioned, the stabilising efforts of monetary policy. Completion of the current design of EMU and providing it with solid governance are priorities that will, however, require broad consensus and political will. Monetary policy  I would now like to discuss the role monetary policy has played in these years and that which it could play in the response to future crises.  When the last crisis broke out, central banks slashed interest rates, which rapidly reached near-zero levels In some cases, such as that of the European Central Bank (ECB), rates even turned negative. In this context, central banks had to implement a series of novel, or “unconventional”, measures. These measures included asset purchase programmes, medium- and long-term lending to the banking industry under advantageous conditions, and announcements about the future course of monetary policy, known as forward guidance. The empirical evidence shows all these measures to have been effective at cushioning the impacts of the economic crisis and supporting the subsequent recovery, and they now form part of central banks’ toolkit for the future. Against this background, what scope is there for monetary policy action in the event of a future crisis? As the inflation outlook improves in the future, interest rates may be expected to rise gradually towards their long-term equilibrium rate. The distance between this level and the effective lower bound on interest rates – i.e. the level below which further rate cuts would be counter-productive as a means of stimulating the economy – will determine the future scope for conventional monetary policy. We now know that the lower bound on interest rates in the euro area is not zero, as was traditionally believed, but a negative number which, although difficult to quantify, is probably not far below the current deposit facility rate of -0.40%.  Economic theory and the empirical evidence suggests that demography is one of the factors underlying the long-term interest rate. Specifically, demographic developments in recent decades in comparable countries, characterised by declining birth rates, increasing life expectancy, and a rising ratio of pensioners to workers, seems to have lowered the long-term equilibrium or “natural” interest rate and is likely to continue to do so in the future. Demographic patterns seem therefore to be contributing to a progressive narrowing of the 
 10/14  scope for central banks to lower their interest rates in the event of deflationary shocks like those suffered during much of the recent crisis.  One tool which can mitigate this foreseeable loss of scope for interest rate policy forward guidance. In recent years, once short-term rates reached their lower limit, central bank announcements undertaking to keep interest rates at low levels for long periods proved effective at flattening the yield curve and reducing the uncertainty over possible future interest rate developments, thus improving financial conditions for the real economy.  Other tools that also provide stimulus when interest rates are no longer able to do so include the monetary authority’s balance-sheet expansion measures. In recent years, the world’s main central banks, including the ECB, have resorted to them with remarkable intensity. In particular, in the Eurosystem the expansion of the balance sheet has mainly been driven by longer-term refinancing operations and the asset purchase programme. These measures have been effective at easing financial conditions in the euro area and, ultimately, at adjusting inflation towards its target. The ECB’s asset reinvestment policy, the guiding principles of which were readjusted yesterday, aims to preserve the monetary stimulus provided by the asset purchase programme through full reinvestment of the assets on the programme’s portfolio as they mature.  In short, monetary policy will continue to have tools with which to tackle future economic and financial crises, although these tools naturally have their limitations. Therefore, as the Governing Council of the ECB has been saying in recent years, rather than overemphasising the role of these tools, they need to be complemented by the implementation of structural reforms and fiscal policies to foster growth. Spanish economic policy: progress made and challenges The Spanish economy has been on a growth path since late 2013 and GDP overtook its pre-crisis levels in mid-2017. A number of structural reforms implemented during the recession contributed to this dynamism. On the domestic front, these include labour market reform, the balance-sheet clean-up and restructuring of credit institutions, pension reform and fiscal consolidation. These reforms have undoubtedly helped largely correct some of the Spanish economy’s main imbalances in the pre-crisis period: in particular, high levels of private sector debt, low competitiveness, the excessive current account imbalance and the excessive weight of the real-estate sector. Similarly, economic policy measures have enabled progress to be made on correcting the problems faced by the financial sector during the worst of the recent crisis.  Nevertheless, the recovery has also benefited from a series of factors exogenous to domestic economic policy with varying degrees of persistence. These factors include the role played by ECB monetary policy and the significant drop in the oil price between mid-2014 and early 2016, and, until the end of last year, the improvement in external markets, in a context of a global economic recovery. However, the effect of these factors can be expected to taper in the future. The foreseeable loss of momentum by the expansionary effects of demand-side policies is also relevant. In 
  11/14 this context, it is particularly desirable for prominence to be given to a renewed reform drive, geared towards correcting the Spanish economy's persisting vulnerabilities. Fiscal policy I will first mention the fiscal policy situation. Over the past decade the Spanish authorities have had to make the fiscal adjustment needed to guarantee the sustainability of the public finances. This process has brought the budget-deficit-to-GDP ratio down from a maximum of 11% in 2009 to 3.1% last year. Despite this deficit cut, Spain’s public accounts continue to show significant weaknesses. First, the European Commission estimates the (cyclically adjusted) structural budget deficit to still be around 3% of GDP in 2018, the highest in the euro area. Second, although government debt is on a slightly downward path from its historical peak of 100.4% of GDP in 2014, at around 98%, it is still very high. The empirical evidence reveals that maintaining a very high level of public debt for a prolonged period tends to hamper economic growth as it becomes a source of vulnerability and reduces the scope for the public budget to act as a stabiliser in the event of a recession. The simulations made in a number of papers published by the Banco de España show that, on realistic assumptions, the process of reducing Spain’s government debt will be very gradual. It may even take several decades to reach a debt-to-GDP ratio of 60%, which is the reference value in Europe’s current fiscal rules. In the light of these considerations, priority should be given to taking advantage of the current favourable economic context to reduce the vulnerabilities deriving from the public finances and create budgetary room for manoeuvre with which to address future crises. These efforts should be given the form of a medium-term programme spelling out the measures enabling the budgetary objectives to be met, and a prudent macroeconomic and public revenue projections.  This process of reducing the fiscal imbalances also needs to be compatible with an improvement in the quality of the public finances. In this connection, the composition of the programme’s revenue and expense adjustment is very relevant to achieving its objectives without hindering economic growth. Combining fiscal consolidation efforts with other structural reforms should also help in this respect.  Reducing the vulnerability of Spain’s public finances is even more important when we consider the medium and long-term challenge posed by population ageing. The latest estimates predict a significant increase in public expenditure on pensions, health-care and long-term care stemming from the substantial rise in the dependency ratio. Even on the most optimistic demographic projections, this ratio is set to rise from 25% today to 50% by mid-century.  In the case of the pension system, the 2011 and 2013 reforms included a number of adjustments that made it possible to significantly counteract the effect of the expected long-term increase in the dependency ratio.  Nevertheless, the latest legislative developments have eased the implementation of these mechanisms with the postponement in application 
 12/14  of the sustainability factor until 2023 and, above all, the return to a system of annual pension increases in line with the consumer price index. According to the Banco de España's calculations, reintroducing this indexing system on a permanent basis would lead to an additional spending increment of more than 3 pp of GDP in 2050.  Consequently, guaranteeing the financial sustainability of the public pension system will require additional measures on the revenue or expenditure sides of the system to offset this additional burden. Pending structural reforms  In the context just described, characterised by the need to pass the baton to demand-side policies to underpin the current expansionary phase and boost growth potential, it would be particularly desirable to give more prominence to measures to correct the Spanish economy’s structural vulnerabilities and strengthen its capacity to adapt to future shocks. The structural reforms undertaken in Spain over the course of recent years have helped make the economy more robust and adaptable to adverse situations. This is particularly desirable in an increasingly changeable and uncertain global environment. One of the key elements providing greater resilience and flexibility is the labour-market reform, which gave businesses more internal flexibility. This flexibility provides additional tools with which to adjust labour costs in the event of a short downturn instead of the traditional mechanism whereby workers – mainly those on temporary contracts – are laid off. Other reforms have also encouraged better allocation of funds by the financial system to new, higher potential, investment projects. These include financial system reform and insolvency law reform, in particular.  Despite these changes, the Spanish economy still faces major structural challenges that limit its potential growth. I would like to highlight three of these challenges: population ageing, the high unemployment rate, and low productivity growth.  Population ageing has consequences for the effectiveness of traditional macroeconomic policies, the sustainability of the public finances, and productivity growth. Addressing this challenge requires a multidisciplinary policy that creates incentives for older workers to remain in the labour force, revises migration policy to try to adapt it to the needs of the labour market, and boosts the birth rate to bring it closer to rates in other European countries by improving the work-life balance and enhancing job stability in the childbearing years. Meanwhile, the high unemployment rate remains a serious drag on growth and welfare. Specifically, it is particularly worrying that almost half of the unemployed have been in this situation for over a year and that the unemployment rate among low-skilled population groups stands at over 25%. The serious mismatch between the skills of employees and the unemployed that tends to arise in such cases suggests there is a need for active employment policies to foster the employability of all socio-demographic groups using the tools that have proven to be effective for each of them. A rigorous evaluation of all the existing programmes is therefore necessary.  In addition to considerations of economic efficiency, as highlighted by a recent analysis by the Banco de España, a lower unemployment rate is directly reflected in an improvement in levels of inequality. This positive effect of employment on income inequality would be 
  13/14 strengthened by reducing the high level of temporary employment in the labour market, provided this decrease did not come at the price of reducing the incentives for permanent hiring.  As regards productivity, Spain’s levels are low by international standards. Improving the dynamics of this variable requires measures in various areas. In particular, it calls for improvements in human and technological capital. In this regard, it is necessary to bolster the legal framework for education to raise quality and address the challenges posed by globalisation, technological progress and automation. This reform also needs to foster innovation in universities and channel it toward the productive system. Additionally, despite the fact that the more productive companies have gained weight in their respective sectors over the past decade, there are still certain obstacles limiting the efficient allocation of resources. Specifically, there is a need to analyse the level of competition in sectors with persistently high profit margins. It would also be desirable to reduce the impact of factors preventing the most productive companies from growing. In this regard, the regulatory thresholds contingent on company size in the legislation need revising.  Making decisive progress on this structural reform agenda is crucial to increasing the economy's long-term growth and laying the foundations for a society that offers its citizens more opportunities. Many of the policies I referred to earlier foster reductions both in the economy’s structural imbalances and in inequality, such that it should be possible to build a broad-based consensus for their approval, despite the obvious difficulties caused by the current political fragmentation.  The challenges for the financial sector In the wake of the last crisis, Spanish banks carried out a thorough process of balance-sheet clean-up, recapitalisation and restructuring which, over the last four and a half years, has markedly improved the industry’s position on basic parameters, such as asset quality or levels of profitability and solvency.  Starting with asset quality, between December 2013 and June 2018 there was a very significant reduction in non-performing loans and foreclosed real-estate assets. Similarly, return on equity returned to positive terrain with rates above the euro area average, recovering from its slump to -25% in 2012. For its part, the total capital ratio has increased by 1.7 pp over the past four years, and the leverage and liquidity ratios are above the European averages. Indeed, recent stress tests by the European Banking Authority and the Banco de España show Spanish banks’ solvency position gives them considerable resilience against adverse scenarios. Nevertheless, even recognising the significant progress made in recent years, the Spanish banking sector continues to face important challenges, which it largely shares with other euro area banking systems. The most significant of these challenges are: i) speeding up the sale of unproductive assets; ii) strengthening capital and liabilities subject to bail-in; iii) improving the industry's reputation by avoiding the risk of misconduct; iv) confronting the challenge of profitability without undue easing of lending standards; and v) making progress in the use of new technologies, which, although they represent a major challenge for the 
 14/14  sector, at the same time they present an opportunity for those entities able to use them to their advantage. In short, the supervisory community and financial institutions share the future challenge of ensuring a more stable financial system that offers better services to society. Concluding remarks In this talk I have reviewed economic policy’s existing room for manoeuvre and instruments with which to address future crises.  I started by discussing those elements (such as reform to the euro’s institutional architecture, international financial system reform and developments in world-trade rules, which will increasingly shape national economic policy).  I then turned to monetary and fiscal policy, which are the main tools for managing the economic cycle, arguing that, at present, and for different reasons, they both have less freedom of action than in the recent past.  Therefore, in my opinion, the fundamental conclusion is that it is necessary to take advantage of the current cyclical position in Spain, while conditions remain favourable, to build up budgetary leeway for future recessions and to introduce structural reforms to take over from recent years’ expansionary demand-side policies in order to prolong the current economic growth phase and boost the economy’s growth potential.  In short, economic policy provides us with a national, European and global toolkit that, if we wish to avoid repeating the errors of the past, we should use properly to prepare ourselves for the next economic crisis, which will surely arrive. The anniversary of the collapse of Lehman Brothers ten years ago, and the economic and financial crisis we have suffered, particularly in Spain, should spur us to press ahead with the reform drive so that, paraphrasing the recent winner of the King Juan Carlos Prize in Economics, Carmen Reinhart, next time is different.   
Egil Matsen: Management and riskSpeech by Mr Egil Matsen, Deputy Governor of Norges Bank (Central Bank of Norway), atNorges Bank, Oslo, 29 November 2018.*   *   *Accompanying charts of the speech.IntroductionAt the beginning of 2018, the Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG) had posted a positivereturn for six consecutive years. The average annual return was almost ten percent in thisperiod. Global financial markets are currently experiencing a period of turbulence. This provides agood opportunity to revisit the risk profile of the GPFG and its management.Chart 1: Six percent annual return since 1998The annual return on the GPFG has been six percent since 1998. As shown in Chart 1, therehave been considerable variations in return from one year to the next, ranging from minus 23percent to plus 26 percent measured in terms of the GPFG’s currency basket.Although our experience since 1998 is important, a complete picture of the level of risk of a fundthat invests for future generations cannot be formed after as short a period as 20 years. ThisNovember marks the 100 anniversary of the end of the First World War. The world’s populationwas then about 1.7 billion. Now there are more than 7.5 billion people in the world, while GDP percapita has increased more than fivefold over the past 100 years.Chart 2: US moves up, Europe falls backGlobal production patterns, and hence the composition of stock markets, have changed just asdramatically. Stock markets’ centre of gravity has undeniably shifted from Europe to the US. In1900, railway shares accounted for 63 percent of the US stock market and 50 percent of the UKstock market, while today, these shares account for less than 1 percent. New industries haveemerged and industries already established in 1900, such as telecommunications, havechanged radically.   In the course of these past 100 years, global equity markets have experienced the GreatDepression of the 1930s, the Second World War, the oil price shock followed by stagnation inthe early 1970s, the dotcom crash in 2000and the financial crisis ten years ago.The management of the GPFG must have a long-term perspective that extends just as far intothe future. We do not know which companies or countries the fund will be invested in 100 yearsfrom now, but we do know that investments will have to change over time. We must also expectthat the return on the GPFG will fluctuate substantially in periods and that the fund will have to bemanaged through future dramatic events. What we do not know is when, how or why suchevents will occur.Maintaining stable management of the GPFG requires sound management of financial risk. Animportant feature of the fund’s strategy is diversification, where the fund’s capital is invested inmany different assets worldwide, reducing the vulnerability of the fund’s return to developmentsin individual companies, sectors or countries. Nevertheless, diversification cannot shield theGPFG from crises that have a broader impact. Being prepared for this type of risk will make iteasier for us, as a society, to maintain the GPFG’s long-term investment strategy in a futuredownturn. Today, I am going to focus on some of the most turbulent periods in global equitymarkets – and on the lessons to be learned.th12 1 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
Owning shares in a large number of companies also exposes the GPFG to another type of risk.Answers and action may be demanded from shareholders in response to an incident in acompany for reasons other than the incident’s effect on expected return. This type of exposuremust also be managed, and the Bank’s work on responsible investment is important in thiscontext. I will come back to this at the end of my speech.Financial riskChart 3: High volatility driven by equitiesChart 3 shows the real return on a hypothetical portfolio since 1900, invested worldwide andcomprising 70 percent equities and 30 percent fixed income instruments. The return ismeasured in USD. As illustrated in the chart, the return has varied widely from one year to thenext.The fixed income investments cushion the largest falls in value, but as shown in the chart, thereturn on the portfolio largely tracks equity market returns. With 70 percent of the GPFG allocatedto equities, changes in the fund’s value ahead will be driven by equity market developments. Letus therefore focus on equity market risk.As shown in Chart 3, 2008 stands out as one of the worst years in this period. Ten years ago, on25 November 2008, Norges Bank presented the GPFG’s results for the third quarter. LehmanBrothers had gone bankrupt. The world’s central banks were making large and frequent cuts inpolicy rates. In the course of autumn 2008, the US stock exchange fell more than five percent onas many as ten separate days. Norges Bank wrote in its press release that “The third quarter of2008 was an unusually demanding quarter for the management of the Government PensionFund – Global.” And it was to get worse. The GPFG posted a return for 2008 of minus 23percent, measured in terms of the fund’s currency basket.Chart 4: Post-crisis paths have differedChart 4 shows developments in the US equity market from 2008 onwards. The rapid reversal inequity markets, shown in the chart, also affected the GPFG’s results. In 2009, the fund posted apositive return of 26 percent, largely thanks to a 34 percent return on the equity portfolio. Thereturn continued to rise in 2010. While the fall in the fund’s value as a result of the financial crisisin 2008 was historically large, the fund’s recovery in 2009 was stronger and faster than hadgenerally been expected. Owing to a weakened krone, the GPFG’s return was less negative interms of NOK than in terms of the fund’s currency basket. Even though changes in the kroneexchange rate do not influence the GPFG’s international purchasing power, the fall in the fund’svalue may have been perceived as less dramatic as a result.Equity markets have not always rebounded after a steep decline as rapidly as after the 2008financial crisis. The chart shows developments in a global equity index in the period after thedotcom crash in 2000. From the peak in winter 2000 to the trough in winter 2003, equity pricesplunged at the fastest pace since the early 1930s. Fluctuations in the krone exchange rateamplified the fall in the GPFG’s value measured in NOK. The value of the GPFG at the beginningof 2003 was 30 percent lower than assumed in the National Budget for 2002.Investors buying equities in Japan’s equity market at the end of 1989 experienced even moredramatic developments. The market fell and stayed there. The value of the shares traded on theTokyo Stock Exchange is still no higher than the 1989 levels. From being the largest in the worldin 1990, accounting for almost 40 percent of global market capitalisation, Japan’s equity marketnow accounts for less than ten percent. However, it is important to remember that thesedevelopments apply to only one country. Global equity markets in general have shown completelydifferent developments since 1989. 2 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
What can we learn from these crises?The first lesson is that crises will occur.Chart 5: Six large falls in 100 yearsIf we look at annual returns in global equity markets since 1900, the chart shows that negativereal equity market returns of the same magnitude as during the financial crisis have occurred infive periods: the Great Depression 1929–31, two world wars, the rise in oil prices at the beginningof the 1970s and the repercussions after the dotcom crash. Both the owner and the manager ofthe GPFG must be prepared for new crises.Chart 6: The fund is largerA larger fund also means more pronounced fluctuations compared with the wider economy.Chart 6 shows the same percentage decline in the value of equities and fixed incomeinstruments as in 2008, disregarding movements in the krone exchange rate. With today’s fund,the same decline would have resulted in a fall in the value of the GPFG of NOK 2700 billion. Thisis equivalent to more than 90 percent of annual mainland GDP, compared with just over 30percent in 2008.In previous periods of falling equity prices, petroleum revenue transfers to the GPFG have beensubstantial relative to the fund’s size. Thus, even with a return in equity and fixed income marketsof minus 19 percent measured in NOK, the capital in the GPFG only fell by approximately NOK 5billion in 2002. In 2008, the sum of the negative return, the change in the krone exchange rateand transfers of petroleum revenues was positive, and the value of the GPFG thereforeincreased between 2007 and 2008.The next time equity prices fall, the figures will be different. As the government’s oil and gasrevenues decline and the size of the GPFG increases, the cushioning impact of petroleumrevenues on any falls in the fund’s value will gradually decrease, making the fund’s value evenmore dependent on the return. In years of negative equity market returns, large absolute falls inthe GPFG’s value must be expected.A second lesson is that stock market crashes do not necessarily reverse quickly. The examples Ihave referred to, the financial crisis in the US, the dotcom crash, and Japan in the 1990s, showthat the crises we have observed in the past can vary in depth and duration. The path of therecovery since the dotcom crash has been somewhat U-shaped. Although the fall in marketvalues was not as steep as in 2008, the recovery was slower. Developments in Japan have beenmore L-shaped: the fall was rapid and the recovery has been slow. Developments since thefinancial crisis have been V-shaped: a steep fall and a rapid recovery. All these crisis scenarioscould occur again.The third lesson is that equity market returns have been high despite periods of substantial equitymarket declines. Estimates of the future return on the GPFG are highly uncertain, but a lowerequity allocation would have pulled down the fund’s expected return. The Ministry of Financeestimates an expected real rate of return on the GPFG of 3 percent.Underlying the decision to allocate 70 percent of the GPFG to equities is an acceptance ofexpected fluctuations in the fund’s return, in the short and longer term. The investment strategyhas enjoyed broad support since the fund’s inception. By adhering to the strategy throughturbulent periods, the GPFG achieved a return equivalent to NOK 4 300 billion at the end of thethird quarter. Historical developments since 1900 and since the GPFG’s inception underpin theexpectation of higher returns in equity markets than in fixed income markets over time.Broad diversification to reduce risk is a key element in the overall investment strategy. At the34 3 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
beginning of 2018, the GPFG was invested in more than 9000 companies in 72 countries. Animportant insight from financial theory is that the expected return on an investment is notdetermined by the risk associated with the investment in isolation, but by that investment’scontribution to systematic risk in a portfolio. An investor cannot be expected to be paid for theextra risk of pursuing a narrow investment strategy. Broad diversification can therefore reducethe total risk of a portfolio, without necessarily lowering the expected return.Systematic risk is risk that cannot be eliminated through diversification and is the risk associatedwith market returns that must be accepted when investing in global financial markets. This is therisk that an investor can expect to be compensated for and that delivers a higher expected return.For the GPFG as a long-term investor, short-term fluctuations are not the most important factor.Periods of weak economic growth occur in all countries. Investing in a broad range of assetsreduces the risk of the return being dominated by such a period.The objection could be raised that international capital markets have become increasinglyinterwoven. Equity markets in different countries are correlated to an increasing extent. Commonfactors will often dominate in acute crises.At the same time, it seems likely that the more fundamental features of an economy are moreimportant in the slightly longer term, as exemplified in the chart. The calculations are based on adata set for equities and ten-year government bonds in 42 countries through all or parts of theperiod 1950–2016. The lines show the five percent worst outcomes for the value of two differentportfolios for different time horizons. The light blue line shows a portfolio diversified across alarge number of markets. The dark blue line is a portfolio invested in a single country. Thediversified portfolio has posted considerably lower falls in value in crises, and the gain increaseswith the duration of the crisis.Chart 7: Increasing gains from diversification over timeIn addition, broad diversification reduces the portfolio’s vulnerability to extreme events, which canbe illustrated by examples from the history of global financial markets since 1900. We have datafor equity market returns in 23 countries for this period. Two of these markets were closed downlast century and the assets expropriated, ie Russia in 1917 and China in 1949. The markets didnot reopen until the beginning of the 1990s. While the Chinese market was small in 1900, theRussian market accounted for six percent of a market-weighted global index.Chart 8: Fifty years of negative real returns in individual countriesAlthough developments have been less dramatic in other countries, equity markets in France,Germany and Japan have all experienced periods of negative real returns of more than 50 years.The longest period of negative real returns for the global index has been just over 20 years.Diversification therefore provides some protection even against the most extreme outcomes,even though it will never be possible to completely shield the return on the GPFG from suchextreme events.The risk associated with being a shareholder in 9000 companiesChart 9: “Diversification is the only free lunch in finance”Harry Markowitz, the founder of modern portfolio theory, is reported to have said: “Diversificationis the only free lunch in finance”. Broad diversification of the GPFG’s investments is in line withMarkowitz’s theory. The GPFG’s investment strategy contributes to an acceptable risk-returnprofile for the fund.At the same time, with ownership shares in 9000 companies, the GPFG is also broadly exposed567 4 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
to conditions and events with dimensions other than the effect on financial risk, related to how acompany deals with a specific incident or more fundamental aspects of its operation. A globallisted company that is criticised for its activities will almost without exception include the GPFGas one of its shareholders. Questions will sometimes be asked about why the fund is invested inthe company and what action is being taken to follow up the fund’s investment.If questions are often raised about whether the GPFG is being managed in what is considered aresponsible manner, support for the investment strategy may be affected. This could in turnincrease the risk that we will not achieve our primary objective of enabling current and futuregenerations to benefit from Norway’s petroleum wealth.The number of questions related to individual investments cannot be reduced by diversification.On the contrary, the number will increase with the breadth of the GPFG’s investments. Theportfolio contains a large number of companies that could run into difficulties.A possible way of managing this type of risk is to exclude companies from the portfolio. Ethicalguidelines for the exclusion of companies from the GPFG were established by the Norwegianauthorities as early as in 2004.Under the guidelines, the GPFG must not be invested in companies producing tobacco or certaintypes of weapons, or with significant coal-related operations. Companies may also be excluded ifthere is an unacceptable risk that the company contributes to or is responsible for certain typesof behaviour.The GPFG’s guidelines for excluding companies show that there is some money Norway saysno to. There are some products and some types of behaviour the GPFG’s owners do not want tobe involved in, whether or not they contribute to financial return.In 2015, the Ministry of Finance decided that the responsibility for excluding companies, based oncriteria laid down by the political authorities, should be transferred to Norges Bank. The ExecutiveBoard’s decisions are based on recommendations and assessments provided by the Council onEthics, which is independent of both the Ministry and Norges Bank.Chart 10: Exclusions are not insignificantAt the beginning of 2018, 133 companies, corresponding to a market value of around NOK 200billion, had been excluded from the GPFG. This is a substantial amount, but only a small shareof the fund.There is an inherent paradox in using exclusion as a responsible investment instrument as ittransfers ownership shares to investors who do not regard the company as problematic in thesame way. Being invested in the company and at the same time exercising active ownership istherefore a possible alternative to exclusion.The ethical guidelines introduced in 2004 also contained guidelines for Norges Bank’s exercise ofownership rights. Ownership rights were to be used to promote a long-term financial return. Andsince then, the mandate has been based on the assumption that a long-term return is dependenton sustainable developments and well-functioning markets. This is particularly applicable to alarge, diversified fund with a long-term perspective such as the GPFG. The fund’s long-termreturn will reflect global value creation.Responsible investment in practice is today a key part of the investment management mandateissued by the Ministry of Finance to Norges Bank. Responsible investment is to a large extentabout promoting well-functioning markets and influencing the fund’s investee companies. NorgesBank complies with international standards and contributes to their further development. NorgesBank Investment Management (NBIM) votes at shareholder meetings at almost all the companies8 5 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
in the GPFG’s portfolio and is in regular dialogue with close to 1000 of the companies in whichwe are most heavily invested. As provided for in the management mandate, NBIM will in somecases divest from a company. In line with the mandate, Norges Bank performs this taskindependently. The Ministry of Finance is not involved in individual investments or the exercise ofownership rights.The GPFG pursues a responsible investment policy to increase the GPFG’s expected return orreduce the risk associated with the fund’s investments. We also consider that a systematicapproach to responsible investment will contribute to maintaining confidence in Norges Bank asmanager of the GPFG.ConclusionAfter 20 years, we have gained some experience of risk in our management of the fund. We havefor example experienced two of the worst periods in equity markets since 1900. This experiencewill be useful the next time financial markets fall sharply. But next time will also be different inmany ways.Norway, through the GPFG, owns a small part of listed companies’ share of global value added.Our investments have made solid gains. We have been willing to take on risk and have beencompensated for it.History has taught us that we must be prepared for falls in market value that are both deep andprolonged. In a crisis, there will be no place to hide for a large global fund. Managing a crisis isdemanding, but for a financial investor, it is essential.Although we must seek to limit the risks we encounter, we must at the same time reiterate thatsome risk is worth undertaking. Broad support for important principles in the management of theGPFG is a strength that will stand the fund in good stead the next time turbulence erupts infinancial markets.Dimson E., P. Marsh and M.

Luis de Guindos: Integration and convergence - from the peseta tothe euroRemarks by Mr Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, at an event inhonour of the 40th anniversary of the Spanish constitution, organised by the Spanish Ministry ofEconomy, Madrid, 18 December 2018.*   *   *This month marks 40 years since Spain began writing the most optimistic chapter of its history.On 6 December 1978 the Spanish people did more than just vote in favour of a democraticcountry that would uphold the values of the rule of law and equality. Our support for theconstitution also laid the foundations for Spain to modernise its economy and become anintegrated part of the European family.In addition to safeguarding fundamental rights and civil liberties, Section 38 of the constitutionstates that “free enterprise is recognised within the framework of a market economy” andconfirms that the public authorities guarantee its exercise. In practical terms, this meant Spainwould align itself with the western model of parliamentary democracy, based on a marketeconomy and free competition and underpinned by the social rule of law. A little more than a yearlater, negotiations began for Spain to join the European Economic Community, a historicmilestone that would be achieved in 1986.But this wasn’t an easy road to follow. The first years of our democracy were marked byeconomic difficulties, partly resulting from the international crises linked to sharp oil priceincreases and the lack of an anchor for inflation expectations in most developed countries.Nevertheless, this new Spain, democratic and integrated into Europe, never stopped lookingoutwards. Trade and financial flows and the movement of capital increased, and exports andimports rose from accounting for roughly 35% of GDP in 1986 to 66% in 2017.These steps towards modernisation would never have been possible without a society that wasconvinced of the fact that Europe represented prosperity and the future. The pro-Europeannature of civil society united Spaniards more strongly than their ideologies or political affiliations,and this sentiment has held firm despite the difficulties people experienced during the financialcrisis.A recent survey by the Elcano Royal Institute shows that eight out of ten Spaniards believe thatopening up markets provides Spanish businesses with good opportunities. This is resoundingproof that Spain benefits from the European Union in general, and the Economic and MonetaryUnion created by the euro area in particular.The annual growth in per capita income between 1977 and 1985, one year before Spain joinedthe EU, was 0.7%, well below the 1.8% enjoyed by the countries that would go on to form theeuro area. However, between 1986 and 1998, before the euro was introduced, Spain’s per capitaincome grew at an extraordinary annual rate of 2.7%, above the average for future euro areacountries of 2.1%.The arrival of the euro also had a positive effect on growth, in spite of the serious difficultiesduring the crisis. Since 1999, GDP per capita has been growing at 1.2%, which is 0.1% higherthan in the other euro area countries and much higher than during the early years of ourdemocracy.Recently, some people have tried to blame the euro for the length of the financial crisis in Spainand have advocated control over monetary policy interest rates and exchange rates. What they12 1 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
often forget is that being a member of the euro area enables Spanish households andbusinesses to benefit from lower real interest rates, lower inflation rates and reducedmacroeconomic volatility, all of which boost productive investments and make a vital contributionto the sustainability of public finances.Furthermore, it is not true that structural currency devaluations solve economic crises.Devaluations are short-term measures. In the long term, the competitive boost they provide iseroded by the higher inflation they cause. And, in a complex system of global production chainslike the one we have today, devaluations can make it harder for businesses to plan. The euro isalso the second-most important currency in the international monetary system, whichstrengthens Spain’s credibility in a global context.It’s true that the crisis revealed significant institutional shortcomings in the structure of themonetary union, but it’s equally true that European countries have taken this on board and carriedout substantial reforms. The banking union represents one of the greatest achievements ofEuropean integration. Banks are now supervised at the European level, which enables risks thattranscend national borders to be identified. Completing the banking union, in particular by settingup a European deposit insurance scheme, should be a priority for national governments.If we look back 40 years, it’s clear that Spain today is a more prosperous and modern country.However, we must not forget that much remains to be done. Improving the functioning of thelabour market is still an outstanding issue – more than 3 million people remain unemployed, andthe youth unemployment rate is still above 30%. But there are grounds for optimism.Following the collapse in GDP during the hard years of recession, Spain, supported by theEuropean Central Bank’s measures, has reached an annual growth rate of 2.8% over the lastfive years, well above the European average. Spurred by the need to search for new marketsduring the years in which domestic demand tightened, Spanish businesses have managed tofind opportunities overseas and many are now global leaders in their sectors.Spanish society has worked very hard to return to economic growth after almost a decademarked by the crisis, and it has done so while remaining true to its commitment to Europe. 40years ago the Spanish people voted for a better country – one that was democratic, open andmodern. The 1978 constitution and the process of European integration have enabled us to makethis better country a reality.The text was published as an op-ed in Expansión on 6 December 2018.See the survey entitled “Europe as seen from Spain and France” (Europa vista desde España y Francia), ElcanoRoyal Institute, March 2018.See “The international role of the euro”, ECB interim report, June 2018.See Almunia, Miguel, Pol Antràs, David Lopez-Rodriguez, and Eduardo Morales. 2018. “Venting Out: Exportsduring a Domestic Slump”.341234 2 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
Sabine Lautenschläger: The banking sector - where did we end upafter all the reforms?Opening statement by Ms Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of theEuropean Central Bank and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the European Central Bank,to panel 1 "After all the reforms: Where did we end up?" at the 6th Frankfurt Conference onFinancial Market Policy: "European Financial Markets – Too Much Variety?", Frankfurt am Main,14 December 2018.*   *   *It’s often said that in every crisis there is an opportunity. And in the case of the financial crisis, Ithink that regulators have seized that opportunity.The crisis prompted an overhaul of banking regulation. And it did so not just at the national orEuropean level. Through the G20 and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the reformsbecame a common project at the global level.So what was the general idea behind these reforms?The primary aim was to address specific issues that had been laid bare by the crisis. This wasthe first step. But regulators knew, of course, that the latest crisis is never a blueprint for the nextone. The next crisis might come in a completely different form.So the second step was to enhance the general resilience of banks, to make them strongenough to withstand any type of storm. This idea underpins the three main building blocks of thereforms: Capital, liquidity and governance.And much has been done on all three fronts. Banks not only have to hold more capital than theydid before the crisis; their capital also needs to be of higher quality. Banks can therefore suffermore losses before they actually fail.At the same time, banks have to fulfil much stricter liquidity standards than before, providingthem with a cushion in case trust evaporates and funding dries up. This allows banks to survivesuch a situation for longer than in the past.Reforms to improve governance and risk management have also come about, but these havereceived less attention. For too long, governance and risk management have taken a backseat inpublic or academic debates.But they are just as important as capital and liquidity – if not more important. After all, goodgovernance and sound risk management help to prevent a bank from getting into trouble in thefirst place. Capital and liquidity are merely backstops for bad management – or bad luck.New rules help banks to set up appropriate processes and integrate them into theirorganisational structures. In this context, one of the standards developed by the BaselCommittee is somewhat underappreciated in my view.I am referring to the BCBS 239 principles for effective risk data aggregation and risk reporting,which play a significant role in adequately managing the risks of a bank. In order to make sounddecisions, top management needs sound data.These are the basics. Where do we stand in turning them into actual policy?Well, it has taken some time to work through the long list of individual reforms. Some of them arealready in place; others are now being implemented – with some delays here and there. 1 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
The final part of Basel III was agreed a year ago, in December 2017. So, this is the major set ofreforms that still needs to be implemented. And while speed plays a role here, substance is alsoimportant.The reforms need to be turned into actual law, and this law has to reflect what was agreed inBasel. It is important that this happens in all of the relevant financial markets. And I fear that thismight not be the case.Not least in Europe, it seems that some of the Basel standards might not be implementedfaithfully. This affects important things such as the leverage ratio, the net stable funding ratio andthe fundamental review of the trading book.Other parts of the rulebook have also come under pressure.Pillar 2 capital is a recent example. Supervisors set the level of Pillar 2 capital to account for riskswhich are not, or are only partially, covered by regulatory capital requirements; it is thus animportant additional tool for making banks more resilient.So far, significant banks in the euro area have had to cover their Pillar 2 requirements withCommon Equity Tier 1, the highest quality of capital. This, however, might change. In the future,banks might generally be allowed to use lower-quality capital to build up their Pillar 2 buffers.Such a change will encourage banks and markets to come up with financial innovations withregard to additional tier 1 capital, or AT1 for short. And this is something we supervisors are notvery keen on, not least because we have already seen significant market volatility.On top of that, the playing field for large and small banks might become uneven. Unlike largebanks, smaller banks are often unable to access AT1 markets. So the opportunity to use AT1 inorder to meet Pillar 2 requirements would be of little benefit to them. Large banks, by contrast,would have an advantage, not least because AT1 coupons are tax-deductible in most MemberStates.To sum up: banks would become less resilient and the playing field less even.But let me come back to Basel.The reforms we agreed on in Basel do make sense, and they strengthen the resilience of banks.A key feature of the reforms is their global nature. They are designed to ensure not only safer andsounder banks but also a level playing field.So if reforms are not implemented as agreed, the playing field will become uneven, opening thedoor to regulatory arbitrage.But regulation is not the only game in town, of course. Supervision counts too. And althoughsupervisors need rules to guide their work, they see that not everything can be or should becaptured by rules. Global reforms such as those devised in Basel and their transposition intoEuropean law cannot be perfectly tailored to each and every business model that banks pursue.At best, rules can cover the average case. This is particularly true in a sector that is changing asquickly as banking.So it is up to the supervisor to adapt the capital requirements to a bank’s specific risk profile inorder to cater for deviations from the average case. To this end, the rules should be principle-based and leave sufficient discretion to the supervisors.In the European context, this need is even greater, as nowadays, we often have to deal with 19slightly different national rules applying to the same case. 2 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
Common principle-based regulation, applied to all 19 countries, would allow supervisors to caterfor bank-specific risks in their national environment, thus ensuring a level playing field.So, let me conclude.The overarching question is: have the reforms so far helped to make the banking sector a saferplace? My answer is: yes they have, but they still need to be finalised. The key point is toimplement the reforms, to turn them into actual law.So, we cannot stand still; we have to move on. And under no circumstances should we movebackwards.Thank you for your attention. 3 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
