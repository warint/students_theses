institutions' precautionary demand liquidity decline substantially. the year-on-year rate change cpi become slightly positive recently, therefore policy commitment significant extent lose influence formation longer-term interest rates. thus, stimulative effect quantitative ease policy economic activity price coincide effect short-term interest rate practically zero percent. the effect monetary ease amplify low interest rate maintain improvement economic price conditions. give situation, bank thoroughly examine economic activity prices, decide change policy framework appropriately accord commitment base cpi. conclusion japan's economy continue recover steadily. the current economic expansion last four years, since january 2002, base cabinet office's reference date business cycles.

e-economy, warsaw, 21 march 2006. * * * lady gentlemen, the first congress e-economy poland hold period enormous progress information communication technology (ict), accompany decline transport cost reduce commercial barriers, result radical acceleration globalization process. some u go even define process straightforwardly third industrial revolution1, create vision remote medical service as, instance, x-ray picture take unite state interpret physician india australia. new technology go beyond border reach human imagination. nearly half million american tax return complete tax consultant

labour efficiency, improve quality product services, reduce prices. even consumer satisfaction survey unite state often conduct call centre locate india. the progress ict also one main factor explain american economy develop far fast rate economy euro area past ten years. the research result available3 show labour efficiency retail wholesale trade unite state grow many time fast europe, inter alia due use ict sectors. the american wal-mart, big global supermarket network, implement new radio-frequency identification technology (rfid) purpose enhancement network performance reduction logistics-related costs. so wal-mart’s suppliers. the example demonstrate way progress e–economy facilitate global optimization manufacture process, contribute rapid growth efficiency, improve quality, reduce prices, thus offer far-reaching benefit consumers. it turn although poland bitter end come readiness implement e-economy, position polish economy high rank concern investment offshoring4 attractiveness, whereas chief advantage include favourable location, large market, well-qualified relatively cheap workforce. therefore, owe process globalization manufacture services, poland may stand chance rapid growth, provide chief shortcomings, include poor advancement e-economy e-administration, remedied. we cannot afford inertia country quickly build modern e-economy. 1

business activities, ability easily employ staff, command foreign language qualifications, social indices, e.g. rate unemployment) weight 30%, business environment (state’s conditions, infrastructure, ability adapt differ culture protection intellectual property) weight 30%. bi review 23/2006 1 in new global economy, public sector must active innovative, must support citizen business community. by way illustration, national bank poland, part statutory task cooperation partner financial sector, create modern payment infrastructure large-amount (the sorbnet system operate nbp) retail (the elixir system operate national clear house — kir s.a.) payment systems, thus ensure provision safe efficient service relate settlement type zloty payments. the scope service bank sector expand 2005 include two new type payment system settlement eurodenominated (domestic cross-border) transactions, namely: sorbnet-euro system, process mainly large-amount (interbank customer) payments, euroelixir system, provide cheap rapid settlement retail payment euro. the sorbnet-euro system facilitate transfer payment target system, thus ensure real-time process cross-border payment bank poland eu member states. apart poland, three eu member state outside euro area (i.e. denmark, sweden great britain) introduce similar change domestic payment system ensure link pan-european infrastructure. no new eu member state implement change to-date. the elixir system, operate kir s.a., one state-of-the-art payment system european union. it mark frequent settlement (three settlement session day national bank poland), ensure brief settlement cycle closure thereof within single work day. the exchange payment order bank effect electronically. in addition elixir system, kir s.a. recently launch euroelixir system (in january 2006, 34 bank include national bank poland nine ten large polish bank participate system), design settle euro-denominated transactions, domestic (with amount-related limitations) cross-border one (up 12,500 euro and, january 1, 2006, 50,000 euro). in case cross-border transactions, achieve due national bank poland’s participation step 2 euro 1 systems. despite relatively high level development polish payment infrastructure, hardly use individual consumers. poland witness significant progress development e-banking past years; however, compare eu member state neighbour countries, position still weak, take account number customer bank account number non-cash payment payment cards. for instance, term number transaction po terminal per one card issue poland, rank extremely low vis-à-vis eu member states. in 2004 poland, approx. 11 transaction execute use one payment card, whereas eu member states, 35 transaction per one card recorded. a detail discussion issue proposal potential activity aim spread non-cash payment deliver mr. adam tochmański, director payment system department, second part today’s session. there doubt, however, strong link exist development payment system e-economy. efficient modern payment infrastructure require settlement transaction e-economy, whereas volume transaction grow environment rapidly develop e-economy e-administration support one another. i mention previously economic transformation relate advance globalization. it crystal clear administration remain indifferent globalization forces. although function administration retain objective define traditional nation-state — create strategy conduct policy, establish law regulations, provide service citizen — scope already changed. to give example, determine strategy conduct policy cannot take place without participation specialist give field outside public sector, law condition operation must align trend bring globalization, provision public service must take account grow need citizens, efficiency maximization chance use practice private sector gives. hence, abovementioned service become decentralized, base public private partnership, privatized. the development information communication technology another factor impact function state. firstly, facilitate switch one-way communication channel interactive two-way communication, lead to, inter alia, great activity citizen business community good adjustment service provide public sector need citizens. secondly, growth ict sector contribute increase innovation demonstrate public 2 bi review 23/2006 sector worldwide, words, alter procedure employ public sector gradually cease reproductive nature, public sector become one leader innovation service sector. consequently, method function state performance function irreversibly head towards use technology assume form estrategy, e-policy, e-regulations e-services. therefore, face e-reality e-administration liability towards e-economy. in past, public sector use follow private sector apply best method organization management, customer relation maintenance management use technologies, lead increase efficiency activities. in contemporary global e-economy public sector much difficult demand role play. first foremost, role consist creation environment citizens, business community entire economy may succeed global market products, services, labour, capital knowledge. efficient performance role call significant change function e-administration, compare traditional public administration. e-administration must creatively use technology provide good service citizen business community, offer wide choice (e.g. way communicate public offices) option customization services, accompany mitigation costs. e-administration must alter organization work communication among public office public administration authorities. this achieve e.g. take burden information management customer (citizens business community). eadministration must set direction development e-economy creation strategies, regulation system incentives. the state, act regulate body, define standard operation impose citizen group “better prepared” citizen obligation use electronic medium communication. in unite state netherlands, instance, large enterprise oblige submit e-tax returns.5 in france, hand, student academic community view engine launch new standards. therefore, application scientific grant accept solely electronic format.6 the imposition obligation one method popularize interactive communication methods. however, limit efficiency must take account situation citizen ready reluctant change habits. research show even country high position rank access individual ict, certain restraint observe use e-administration service offer citizens. in denmark, instance, discover reason restraint lie lack common understand personal benefit user e-administration service may enjoy.7 it point need improvement relate education information campaigns. denmark exception respect. promotional campaign encourage use electronic medium communication public administration develop many countries; country already launch activities. in singapore, website launch enable payment almost every public office government agency country, user participate weekly monthly prize draws.8 in dubai another interest solution employed, whereby

necessity change way communication citizens, also force public office adjust internal process enhance cooperation. a consequence, project “any door good” launched, whereby office assume responsibility

passport photo-shop, immediately passport picture taken. another significant factor, stimulate growth e-administration e-economy, penetration innovation search new application technology use private public sectors. for instance, abovementioned rfid technology initially use mark good transport storage, technique advance bar code. china, implement rfid standard result effort wal-mart, world-largest retailer, currently consider use blood bank track location blood batches. another use rfid technology — also health care sector — currently test orthopaedic ward singapore general hospital. for

issing, member executive board european central bank, event organise bank finland, helsinki, 24 march 2006. * * * after seven years, euro firmly establish currency 300 million people. it internal stability evidence fact inflation steadily low start, despite sequence negative price shock (in particular continuous surge oil prices). a international currency, euro second u dollar. at time, euro represent unique experience history. on one hand, base clear supranational monetary order, whereby european central bank full sovereignty conduct single monetary policy euro area. on hand, political union still limit sovereignty remain predominantly national many policy areas. this asymmetry raise question sustainability institutional arrangement since well european monetary union start 1 january 1999. the “no” french dutch people treaty establish constitution europe trigger new interest prospect monetary union future course political union. this happen despite fact text european constitution imply change role ecb, significantly affect allocation responsibility policy areas. the continuous challenge europe find right balance political, economic monetary integration. this call “triangle” state (or states!), market currency. economic integration take lead in september 1946, winston churchill, memorable zurich speech, call re-creation “european family”. this include setting-up structure permit europe live peace, safety freedom. although political integration prove over-ambitious, visionary political leader decided, nevertheless, pursue path economic integration. this lead found european coal steel community 1952 establishment european economic community treaty rome 1957. the first step custom union among six found countries. at time, probably nobody could guess economic integration would advance various phase long period. but single european act follow 1986 “single market programme” 1992. in short, single market become reality. work remain imperfection single market also advancing. we must forget process require many decade continuous political support. why, last 50 years, economic integration face few obstacle actually keep motion process european integration? the main reason that, outset, economic integration remove barrier thereby secure material economic benefits. in fact, bring widespread benefit promote reciprocal trade. trade fact grow several multiples. economic integration also help establish competitive environment. we must also forget economic integration render eu country interdependent past. under circumstances, spillover national policy could significant. each country stake well-being and, let say, “good behaviour” partners. give circumstances, conviction underlie maastricht treaty nominal exchange rate irrevocably fix achieve maintain truly unify single european market. without single currency, felt achievement deepen single market could endangered. bi review 23/2006 1 it political decision launch european economic monetary union among group countries, form fully-fledged political union. take stock, may ask: move appropriate well found economic standpoint? for moment, i want go back research economic argument – create monetary union. in 1960s, group researcher – follow pioneer contribution mundell, kenen mckinnon start pose crucial question: purely economic point view, optimal area single currency? the optimum currency area (oca) theory ensue well-known i don’t say much it. it easy summarise many view euro area oca, sum vast volume empirical study oca criterion european countries. the euro area may yet optimum currency area respect extent that, example, unite state is. on hand, score quite highly several oca criterion – economic openness, diversification production consumption, degree price stability, several element financial integration. in area score le well – price wage flexibility, facet financial integration – remedy sought. how could emu affect optimality euro currency area time? andrew rise jeffrey frankel offer important new forward-looking perspective strengthen oca argument euro area. by study effect several currency union occur past, show monetary integration lead significant deepen reciprocal trade. the implication emu euro area may turn optimum currency area launch monetary integration, even oca before. in words, quote rise frankel: “countries join emu, matter motivation may be, may satisfy oca property ex-post even ex-ante!” this term “endogeneity optimum currency area” effect. several author bring forward concept similar hypothesis “endogeneity oca”, area trade. artis zhang discuss endogeneity symmetry shocks. blanchard wolfers, saint paul bentolila, discuss endogeneity labour market institutions. kalemli-ozcan, sørensen yosha discus effect share single currency financial market insurance schemes. therefore, may diverse source “endogeneities oca.” such endogeneities see set process trigger start monetary union. hence, monetary union may help set motion force bring country close together, force present (or strong enough) before. to fair, various issue may arise year ahead could render verdict complex. some authors, krugman “lessons massachusetts”, postulate “concentration” hypothesis: euro, together strong trade financial ties, result great specialisation euro area countries. this may gradually intensify inter-industry trade, cause country become sensitive industry-specific shocks. in turn, idiosyncratic business cycle would result. hence, force concentration prevail, euro area country may witness pronounce growth, employment inflation differential past. this could concern view generally limit price wage flexibility, low labour mobility lack risk-sharing mechanism due still incipient financial integration. time judge severity potential effect. montary union with completion single market european monetary union economic monetary side “triangle” completed. this raise fundamental question: can monetary union work survive without third side triangle, without fully-fledged political union? the answer clear: yes, can. it possible that, long term, strong element political union may (need to) emerge, time economic monetary union (emu) proceed perfectly well without political union form understand today. here main arguments: 2 bi review 23/2006 first, monetary union clear political dimension. it entail transfer national monetary policy decision-making power supranational entity, european central bank. relinquish national sovereignty important field substantive contribution political integration. a central bank is, all, element statehood. the maastricht treaty make ecb independent political influence able fulfil clear mandate preserve price stability. monetary policy-making hence centralise also depoliticised. this step possible euro area member achieve high degree convergence monetary policy attitude preference run-up monetary union. moreover, way participate country see role nation state change profoundly. in respect, launch euro mark recent far-reaching step. national sovereignty transfer area monetary exchange rate policy also key policy areas, competition trade. finally, single market established. a result, euro area country already share important element state formation also key function monetary union. flexibility second, purely economic perspective, else need make single monetary policy work? most importantly, flexible market need enhance ability individual country respond specific circumstance economic shocks. wage price particular may need adapt quickly strongly. the mobility capital become increasingly important adjustment mechanism. in order market flexible send proper signals, policy-makers must ensure institutional framework set right incentives. substantial progress make lot still need done. in particular, labour market reform still lag many countries. a result, ability economy adapt quickly generate employment still limited. the lisbon agenda, “pro-employment growth blueprint” europe, set right priorities. however, need implement forcefully. this would go long way towards create dynamic flexible environment europe needs, proper function monetary union also attainment growth employment objective lisbon agenda. the stability growth pact sound fiscal policy another prerequisite monetary union work. a sovereignty fiscal policy remain national level, eu member country decide introduce fiscal rule help prevent imprudent fiscal policy adverse effect inflation expectations. these rule enshrine maastricht treaty operationalised stability growth pact. in set deficit debt target (most notably 3% deficit limit) establish procedure budgetary surveillance control, fundamentally different appropriate rule national level. compliance rule member state keep deficit low enough ensure government solvency provide government necessary room smoothen economic fluctuation operation automatic fiscal stabilisers. this also generate appropriate fiscal environment monetary policy-making euro area level. the growth stability pact fundamental pillar european monetary union. past problem implementation cannot denied, recent reform pact aim remedy this. in order foster fiscal discipline, government member states, together commission, need implement revise rule rigorous consistent manner. the current excessive deficit procedures, case germany large economy also “source” pact real test. in way, confidence credibility rule prudent fiscal policy reinforced. this easy task, admittedly, serious concern expressed. sound fiscal policy remain priority many year come. the final stage what imply future europe? give achievement economic political integration europe past 50 years, remain confident also find answer current problems. many problem emerge mastered, although solution bi review 23/2006 3 typically take time rarely come overnight. doe mean trust past record achievement? obviously not. current future challenge need address action current future political leaders. we doubt see new challenge ongoing discussion debate appropriate policy approach consolidate extend success emu. however, expect challenge debate threaten emu underestimate strength european institutions, willingness make project work ability knock head together tough solution required. on final stage integration process, steady state political union europe, one speculate. none example history, federation state union nations, serve blueprint shape political union. the eu always been, remain, unique undertake model easily adopted. it important allow evolutionary process, open step integration, yet safeguard already place work well, assign competency nation state even region appropriate. in fact, midst process quite time, monetary union remain one major success stories. 4 bi review 23/2006 zeti akhtar aziz: the international centre education islamic finance governor's luncheon address dr zeti akhtar aziz, governor central bank

norge bank, seminar host swedbank market oslo/first securities, gardermoen, 23 march 2006. the chart find norge bank’s website. the address base assessment present norge bank’s press conference follow executive board’s monetary policy meet 16 march, inflation report 1/06 previous speeches. * * * the interest rate variable affect us, whether investor borrowers. and even don’t debt assets, influence interest rate economy affect u indirectly. in presentation, i would like first discus briefly various role play interest rate theoretical framework instrument monetary policy. with background, i go present norge bank’s view norwegian economy monetary policy assessment, publish inflation report 16 march. the interest rate several function interest rate term money good today may trade money good future date - price pay bring consumption forward time compensation receive postpone consumption. the interest rate also price money – price pay order liquid hold compensation receive store save le liquid forms. the interest rate also use instrument economic policy. set interest rate achieve monetary policy objective, often price stability low stable inflation, usually responsibility central bank. this also case norway. low stable inflation provide economy nominal anchor, important contribution monetary policy make sound economic development long term. this contribute increase predictability take decision save investment today, although result decision also depend economy develop future. in conduct monetary policy, norge bank operate flexible inflation target regime, weight give variability inflation variability output employment. flexible inflation target build bridge long-term objective monetary policy, keep inflation target provide anchor inflation expectations, short-term objective stability real economy. monetary policy influence economy long variable lags. norge bank set interest rate view stabilise inflation target within reasonable time horizon, normally 1–3 years. the relevant horizon depend disturbance economy expose affect path inflation real economy period ahead. the primary instrument monetary policy norge bank’s sight deposit rate. this rate determine short interest rate money market maturity one day upwards, normally norge bank’s next monetary policy meeting. longer-term rate determine expectation concern norge bank’s use instrument future degree confidence monetary policy. it may useful distinguish three channel real interest rate influence inflation: the demand channel: a interest rate increase, household municipal consumption investment tend slow down. this le money leave service debt borrow expensive. corporate finance weaken investment may become le attractive. low demand lead low output employment. wage growth may bi review 22/2006 1 slow down. low wage growth combine reduce profit margin result decrease inflation. the exchange rate channel: the effect interest rate change may amplify interest rate also affect krone exchange rate. when interest rate higher, people invest few borrow nok. high interest rate thus normally lead appreciation krone. import good become le expensive inflation decelerate. a strong krone also dampen export reduce profitability norwegian business industry. the effect exchange rate change interest rate vary theme sentiment shift foreign exchange market. the expectation channel: we believe expectation play important role price wage set. expectation concern future inflation economic stability considerable impact, least foreign exchange market. inflation expectation also influence wage demand effect company adjust prices. it difficult precise expectation formed. confidence inflation target may provide anchor. past inflation rate may also influence think inflation future. there thus interaction inflation expectation inflation. if confidence monetary policy, expect inflation medium term close inflation target. this contribute stabilise inflation around target. it thus important central bank ensure households, companies, social partner financial market participant confident inflation remain low stable. let introduce concept “neutral rate” “long-term equilibrium rate”. both see real rates, nominal interest rate adjust expect inflation. the neutral real interest rate define rate result increase reduction price cost inflation economy course business cycle. an assessment whether interest rate set expansionary contractionary involve compare actual short-term market rate neutral rate. i revert quantification neutral rate later. the interest rate influence save investment. in long term, real interest rate level determine capital accumulation economy potential economic growth. the long term equilibrium real interest rate rate ensure capital accumulation correspond save decision economy. this rate result path potential output satisfy preference distribute demand time without generate pressure slump economy. the equilibrium rate determine long-term phenomenon associate structure economy, like consumer impatience, population growth technological progress. the neutral rate define basis impact capacity utilisation inflationary pressure economy. in long term, neutral interest rate correspond long-term equilibrium interest rate economy. there also limit much long-term equilibrium interest rate deviate country time world liberalise capital markets. the interest rate therefore several role play economy role fairly closely linked. the interest rate shall short medium term contribute stable inflation stable development production. this require active use interest rate policy instrument. but interest rate also contribute equilibrium market real capital long run. to achieve this, real interest rate must time deviate much return real capital. substantial deviation give rise undesirable fluctuation market real capital basis economic fundamentals. in norway, short- long-term real interest rate moment low level, compare past decades. this also case many countries. how large deviation neutral equilibrium rate are, hand, le clear. neither neutral rate equilibrium rate variable observed. economic theory contribute insight factor determine equilibrium rate, attempt quantify base theory yield uncomfortably broad interval. an alternative use historical average interest rate basis assumption actual real interest rate vary around equilibrium rate. this method also pose problems, however. 2 bi review 22/2006 throughout period 1870-2005, average long-term real interest rate norway remain close average uk us: norway 2.2 per cent, uk 2.0 per cent u 2.8 per cent. in countries, fluctuation real interest rate substantial periods. the real interest rate fall markedly since begin 1990s. there ongoing debate reason decline long-term real interest rate last years. i elaborate debate here; subject worthy seminar itself. one particular possibility, pertain discussion role real interest rate, fall long-term interest rate may partly reflect market participants’ assessment neutral real interest rate fallen. during business cycle, real interest rate’s deviation neutral real interest rate – real interest rate gap – indicate whether monetary policy expansionary contractionary. the neutral real interest rate difficult estimate may change time. nevertheless, tried. on uncertain basis estimate neutral real interest rate norway may close 2½ per cent, come approximately 1½ percentage point since mid-1990s. forecast late inflation report indicate short term real interest rate norway close neutral level four years. accord this, real interest rate gap (the difference neutral rate actual rate) negative since 2004. there evidence monetary policy desire impact real economy inflation. monetary policy present phase cycle growth norwegian economy high since summer 2003. the expansion gradually broadened. low interest rate contribute relatively sharp rise household demand throughout upturn. at time, solid global growth lead increase demand many norwegian export good high prices. fix investment petroleum sector increase sharply, result grow demand good service supply mainland enterprises. mainland fix investment also pick gradually. so far economic upturn, mainland economy grow average 3.5 per cent quarterly, measure annualised rate. the output gap measure express assessment total capacity utilisation economy. the output gap define percentage difference actual output potential output. potential output indicate level output consistent price cost stability. the estimate output gap uncertain partly level potential output unobservable. since official statistic overall activity economy available immediately subsequently revised, level actual output uncertain. in assess size output gap, technical calculation compare information capacity utilisation economy. a information come light, output gap revise downwards 2005, time growth rate towards end year estimate higher. output increase rapidly potential output 2-3 years. much available capacity put use. we estimate capacity utilisation approximately ½ per cent normal end-2005. despite strong economic growth, inflation still low. a recovery become broadly based, inflation gradually begin edge higher. in second half 2005, 12-month rise consumer price adjust tax change exclude energy product (cpi-ate) vary 1 1½ per cent, surprise downside december january. in february, inflation edge again. monthly variation cpi-ate fairly pronounce recently. there little prospect inflation increase substantially near term. if adjust effect reduce maximum day-care rates, year-on-year rise cpi-ate project 1¼ per cent second quarter 2006. inflation dampen continue low external price impulse appreciation krone 2004 2005. after period, unwind sharp rise petrol price 2005 probably lead decline year-on-year rise cpi. growth among trade partner still solid, appear whole somewhat strong assume month ago. high commodity price contribute somewhat high bi review 22/2006 3 inflation, far underlie inflation push up. key rate raise number countries, market participant expect interest rate increases. key rate remain low among many trade partners. market participant expect gradual increase key rate period ahead, sweden euro area. in us, key rate expect increase 50 basis point peaking. in uk, key rate expect remain virtually unchanged period ahead. long-term interest rate also low countries. oil price rise markedly last couple years. growth global oil demand expect approach 2 per cent 2006. this line expect growth supply non-opec countries. on whole, support view price oil remain high. future price indicate price oil may remain usd 60 per barrel next years. high growth global economy also contribute rise price commodities. this increase continue 2006. in spite slight decline recently, metal price increase substantially recent months. there also pronounce increase future prices, indicate expectation sustain upward movement metal price similar oil prices. high commodity price contribute somewhat high head-line inflation, far underlie inflation risen. rise commodity price buoyant activity market important norway fuel growth norwegian economy. we assume upturn continue trade partner whole. growth project somewhat strong 2006 2005. nevertheless, still idle resources, especially number european countries, imply continue low inflation. in recent years, investment petroleum sector increase sharply. investment growth generate substantial impulse mainland economy. the large development project relate snøhvit outside hammerfest ormen lange aukra make large contribution high level investment. both project also involve considerable onshore development, may generate strong impulse business sector locally pure offshore projects. investment activity associate snøhvit ormen lange probably decline period completion 2007. high oil price lead strong increase activity norwegian continental shelf. many project launch increase recovery field operation. a number oil company revise upwards long-term oil price use basis investment decisions, although still moderate compare future prices. further projection period, development petroleum-related investment highly uncertain. it assume overall activity decline somewhat snøhvit ormen lange completed, high oil price contribute maintain investment relatively high level throughout projection period. the fiscal rule imply gradual phasing-in petroleum revenue economy, approximately pace expect real return government pension fund – global, formerly know petroleum fund. the government pension fund – global likely expand sharply year ahead. on basis assumption development oil price ahead (oil future prices), mechanical application 4 per cent rule imply use petroleum revenue increase nok 31 billion 2006 2009. this somewhat high expect government’s supplement budget 2006. the difference partly explain fact end-2005 fund’s capital high estimate government, partly government assume oil price ahead would low current oil futures. for 2007, assume approximately unchanged structural non-oil deficit. with continue solid growth norwegian economy, would line fiscal rule use petroleum revenue low expect real return government pension fund – global years. our projection base assumption fiscal policy provide stimulus aggregate demand output 2008 2009, somewhat le mechanical application fiscal rule base oil price assumption would imply. 4 bi review 22/2006 norge bank operate flexible inflation target regime seek achieve interest rate path provide reasonable balance objective bring inflation towards 2.5 per cent time stabilise development output employment. norge bank’s projection baseline scenario base interest rate path find strike reasonable balance two objectives. in baseline scenario, interest rate norway abroad assume rise somewhat fast long term current forward rate may imply. exchange rate movement difficult project. the interest rate path home abroad may consistent approximately unchanged krone exchange rate. the high growth rate economy imply gradual pick-up price cost inflation. with interest rate development outline above, cpi-ate inflation project increase 1¼ per cent today 2 per cent end 2007. there prospect increase inflation, inflation project close target 2.5 per cent three year ahead. accord estimates, capacity utilisation slightly high normal level. mainland gdp project show sustain strong growth 2006. the output gap expect increase next two years, peak fairly moderate level gradual increase interest rate dampen demand growth. growth global economy project remain high, result high demand favourable price norwegian export sector. there prospect high petroleum investment contribute sustain high level activity norwegian economy. in 2008 2009, continue high level petroleum revenue may imply expansionary fiscal policy. interest-rate set since last summer orient towards gradual increase interest rate – small, frequent step – towards normal level. base norge bank’s assessment drive force economy, strategy appear robust. output growth strong labour market become tight quickly expected. high growth economy may isolation suggest fast increase interest rate ahead. this would reduce risk bottleneck economy, rise cost inflation continue debt build-up. on hand, objective bring inflation towards target anchor inflation expectation argue restraint upward movement interest rates. on balance, imply interest rate outlook remain virtually unchanged compare previous report. thus current assessment indicate interest rate path interest rate raise 1 percentage point year, line expectation market. the two previous inflation report underline risk low interest rate long period may result strong pressure economy, risk bottlenecks, accelerate cost inflation debt accumulation. on hand, report also point risk continue trade shift increase competition labour product market might result low price wage inflation weak pressure economy. through autumn, statistic favour either alternative, see sign both. this may increase uncertainty surround state norwegian economy. monetary policy must strike balance various objectives. strong growth norwegian economy, tight labour market, pronounce rise equity price high credit growth must weigh unexpectedly low inflation. we illustrate uncertainty surround forecast interest rate, inflation output gap fan charts. the width fan chart base historical disturbances. however, certainty future disturbance nature scale. the wide fan chart are, uncertain projections. uncertainty surround interest rate reflect monetary policy response unexpected disturbance inflation, output exchange rate. on basis analysis inflation reports, norge bank’s executive board ass consequence future interest rate development adopt monetary policy strategy period next report. the executive board’s assessment meet 16 march interest rate may gradually – small, frequent step – bring back towards normal level. the objective bring inflation back target anchor inflation expectation nevertheless imply monetary policy remain expansionary. the sight deposit rate interval 2¼ – 3¼ per cent period publication next inflation report 29 june 2006, conditional economic development broadly line projections. norge bank’s executive board also decide meet 16 march raise sight deposit rate 0.25 percentage point 2.50 per cent. bi review 22/2006 5 ben s bernanke: reflection yield curve monetary policy remark ben s bernanke, chairman board governor u federal reserve system, economic club new york, new york, 20 march 2006. * * * i would like thank economic club new york invite speak evening. i intend take opportunity afford audience expert global financial market address intrigue financial phenomenon: fact that, past seven quarter so, tighten monetary policy accompany long-term yield move little net. why long-term interest rate rise more, do previous policy tighten cycles? and implication pattern long-term interest rate monetary policy economic outlook? a see, remark i good job raise question answer them. in particular, i conclude implication monetary policy recent behavior long-term yield clear-cut. i hope agree question nevertheless worthwhile posing, intertwine number important economic financial issues. i say outset view i express necessarily share colleague federal open market committee (fomc). the federal reserve's tighten cycle the tighten cycle begin end june 2004 notable least four respects. first, onset delay long many observer expected. the fomc keep policy unusually accommodative extended, i say considerable, period. the goal, know, help ensure economic expansion would self-sustaining protect remote risk fall inflation observe 2003 might culminate outright deflation--an outcome could potentially serious consequence economy efficacy monetary policy. indeed, concern mind, 2003 federal reserve make explicit first time price stability symmetric objective: it important avoid inflation low well inflation high. a second way recent experience unusual extent policy action signal advance. both month lead initiation tighten cycle cycle itself, statement issue meet fomc provide qualitative guidance likely future path policy dependence economic events. provide information expect path policy help ensure long-term interest rate asset price build project pace tighten rapid committee anticipated, statement's focus conditionality future policy action emphasize ongoing need policymakers financial market participant respond economic news. in retrospect, clear communication policy provide notable benefits, view, increase effectiveness monetary policy minimize unnecessary volatility financial markets. third, policy move gradually, tighten one-quarter point increment fourteen successive meetings. together expand communication, gradual approach serve stabilize policy expectation damp market volatility. in addition, measure pace rate increase give committee time observe progress economy adjust plan communication strategy accordingly.1 to sure, gradualism possible inflation expectation remain contained--testimony importance central bank's retain credibility financial market among business households. a fourth interest aspect late tighten cycle, principal focus evening, behavior long-term interest rates. since june 30, 2004, overnight interest rate move 3-1/2 percentage points, ten-year nominal treasury yield edge higher. at le 4- 1 i speak detail "gradualism," speech deliver economics luncheon co-sponsored federal reserve bank san francisco (seattle branch) university washington, seattle, may 20, 2004. bi review 21/2006 1 3/4 percent, yield much target federal fund rate 4-1/2 percent and, indeed, even yield maturity one three years. in remainder remark i speculate reason consequence historically unusual behavior long-term rates. the recent behavior longer-term yield some discussion arithmetic longer-term yield provide useful perspective recent development bond markets. the ten-year treasury yield, example, view weight average current one-year rate nine one-year forward rates, weight depend coupon yield security. a i discuss, forward rate split (1) portion equal one-year spot rate market participant currently expect prevail correspond date future, (2) portion reflect additional compensation bondholder risk hold longer-dated instruments. current near-term forward rate particularly sensitive monetary policy actions, directly affect spot short-term interest rate strongly influence market expectation spot rate likely stand next year two. indeed, would expect, recent tighten policy accompany increase current one-year rate next years' forward rates. for example, since june 2004, one-year forward rate period two three year future rise almost 1-1/2 percentage points. a ten-year yield unchanged even near-term component rise appreciably, follow matter arithmetic component represent return distant time must fallen. in fact, one-year forward rate nine year ahead decline 1-1/2 percentage point tighten cycle. incidentally, compare forward rate imply yield nominal treasury imply treasury security index inflation, infer two-thirds overall decline far-distant nominal forward rate tighten cycle associate drop real yields, remainder reflect drop inflation compensation. it important note mark decline far-forward interest rate confine u.s. treasury securities. the spread yield treasury longer-term private security corporate bond little change net since june 2004, imply essentially fall forward rate see treasury market occur private yield well. these pattern also appear security denominate dollars. for example, period, longer-term government swap yield unite kingdom euro area move appreciably lower. indeed, long-term nominal yield drop number countries, often unite states, yield curve many country also rather flat even slightly inverted. some reason decline far-forward rate why far-forward rate imply term structure interest rate decline recent years? observer offer two broad (and mutually exclusive) class explanations. one set explanation hold bond yield react current prospective macroeconomic conditions. another set focus special factor may influence market demand long-term security per se, independent economic outlook. i first consider explanation emphasize possible change net demand long-term security late return explanation focus link bond yield economic outlook. a i noted, forward interest rate implicit term structure usefully decompose two parts: (1) spot interest rate market participant currently expect prevail correspond date future (2) additional compensation investor require risk hold longer-term instruments, know term premium. with economic outlook hold constant, change net demand long-term security large effect term premium. in particular, demand long-dated security rise relative supply, investor generally accept le compensation hold longer-term instruments--that is, term premium decline. to quantify importance shift balance demand supply consequent change term premium, appeal research literature term structure interest rates. in modern model term structure, yield horizon explain small number 2 bi review 21/2006 factors. in models, factor explicitly tie observable economic variables, inflation; models, factor represent statistical summary data explicit economic interpretations. these factors, turn, use estimate term premium point time, although one clearly acknowledge result sensitive various statistical model assumptions. accord several popular models, substantial portion decline distant-horizon forward rate recent quarter attribute drop term premiums.2 use models, divide term premium two parts--a premium bear real interest rate risk premium bear inflation risk. both component trend low time well, accord standard models, decline premium since last june 2004 appear associate mainly drop compensation bear real interest rate risk. at least four possible explanation put forth net demand long-term issue may increased, low term premium. first, longer-maturity obligation may attractive stable inflation, better-anchored inflation expectations, reduction economic volatility generally. with benefit hindsight, recognize important change occur u.s. economy (and, indeed, major industrial economy well) sometime mid-1980s. since time, volatility real gdp growth inflation decline significantly, phenomenon economist dub "great moderation." i argue elsewhere improve monetary policies, stabilize inflation good anchor inflation expectations, important reason positive development; doubt, structural change economy deregulation, improve inventory control methods, good risk-sharing financial market also contributed.3 whatever reason fall macroeconomic volatility, investor come expect past performance continue, might believe le compensation risk--and thus low term premium--is require justify hold longer-term bonds. in regard, interest observe long-term forward rate also low 1950s 1960s. with long-term inflation expectation apparently anchor low level prospect continue economic stability, market participant may believe appropriate price bond environment like prevail four five decade ago. a second possible explanation evident decline term premium link increase intervention currency market number governments, particularly asia. accord explanation, foreign official institutions, primarily central banks, invest bulk greatly expand dollar hold u.s. treasury closely substitutable securities, demand official sector put downward pressure yields. this interpretation support, include research i two coauthor find longer-term yield come significant downward pressure episode heavy official purchase dollar 2004.4 and financial-market participant appear especially sensitive suggestion foreign official entity may alter portfolio preferences. however, observation speak existence short-term impact large purchase sales--the result limit liquidity short run--than perhaps important question whether transaction last effect yields. on latter issue, clear evidence hard come by. several piece indirect evidence suggest long-term effect foreign purchase yield may moderate. notably, global market dollar-denominated bond enormous--perhaps around $25 trillion, include dollar-denominated debt issue country well debt issue abroad u.s. residents. in long run, therefore, market able absorb purchase sale large absolute magnitude relatively modest change yields. indeed, long-term yield continue fall recent quarter even foreign official hold treasury security increase slow pace previously. 2 don h. kim jonathan h. wright (2005), "an arbitrage-free three-factor term structure model recent behavior long-term yield distant-horizon forward rates," finance economics discussion series 2005-33 (washington: board governor federal reserve system, august). 3 ben s. bernanke (2004), "the great moderation," speech deliver meet eastern economic association, washington, d.c., february 20. 4 ben s. bernanke, brian p. sack, vincent r. reinhart (2004), "monetary policy alternative zero bound: an empirical assessment," brook paper economic analysis (2), pp. 1-100. bi review 21/2006 3 the performance treasury relative fixed-income instrument also argue dominant influence foreign official portfolio decision long-term rates. if foreign official hold treasury source decline yields, would expect observe increase spread yield treasury security return type debt le favor foreign official holders. but see significant widen private yield spread relative treasuries--quite contrary--and, i note earlier, yield industrial economy fall well, many case u.s. yields. a reasonable conclusion accumulation dollar reserve abroad influence u.s. yields, reserve accumulation abroad only, even dominant, explanation recent behavior. change management account pension fund third possible source decline term premium. reform propose unite states, europe, elsewhere widely expect encourage pension fund fully fund take step good match duration asset liabilities. together increase need age population industrial country prepare retirement, change may increase demand longer-maturity securities. we see little direct evidence date sizable pension-fund portfolio shift toward long-duration bonds, least unite states. but judge anecdotal reports, bond investor might attach significant odds scenario pension fund tilt composition portfolio toward asset substantially time. fourth finally, investors' demand long-duration security may increase past years, supply security seem keep pace. the average maturity outstanding treasury debt, example, drop 1-1/2 year since peak 2001, trend begin turn treasury's reissuance thirty-year bond. corporation households, however, take advantage low long-term rate lengthen duration debt recent years, compensate extent reduce duration available treasury debt. long-term yield monetary policy what historically unusual behavior long-term yield imply conduct monetary policy? the answer, turn out, depend critically source behavior. to extent decline forward rate trace decline term premium, perhaps one reason i suggested, effect financially stimulative argue great monetary policy restraint, else equal. specifically, spend depend long-term interest rates, special factor low spread short-term long-term rate stimulate aggregate demand. thus, term premium declines, high short-term rate require obtain long-term rate overall mix financial condition consistent maximum sustainable employment stable prices. however, behavior long-term yield reflect current prospective economic conditions, implication policy may quite different--indeed, quite opposite. the simple case point low fall long-term yield reflect investor expectation future economic weakness. suppose, example, investor expect economic activity slow point future. if investor expect weakness require policy ease medium term, mark project path future spot interest rates, low far-forward rate cause yield curve flatten even invert. indeed, historically, slope yield curve tend decline significantly advance recessions. what relevance scenario today? although macroeconomic forecast fraught hazards, i would interpret currently flat yield curve indicate significant economic slowdown come, several reasons. first, previous episode invert yield curve follow recession, level interest rate quite high, consistent considerable financial restraint. this time, short- long-term interest rates--in nominal real terms--are relatively low historical standards.5 second, i already discussed, extent flatten inversion yield curve result small term premium, implication future 5 this consistent empirical work ben s. bernanke alan s. blind 1992), "the federal fund rate channel monetary transmission," american economic review, vol. 82 (september), pp. 901-21. in paper, find level federal fund rate extremely informative future movement real macroeconomic variables. 4 bi review 21/2006 economic activity positive rather negative.6 finally, yield curve one financial indicator researcher find useful predict swing economic activity. other indicator empirical success past, include corporate risk spreads, would seem consistent continue solid economic growth. in regard, fact actual imply volatility financial price remain subdue suggest market participant harbor significant reservation economic outlook. an alternative perspective hold recent behavior interest rate presage economic slowdown suggest instead level real interest rate consistent full employment long run--the natural interest rate, will--has declined. for example, observer point factor may create longer-term drag growth household spending, include high energy costs, likelihood slow growth house prices, possible reversal recent decline save rates. if drag growth spend materialize, low real interest rate need sustain aggregate demand keep economy near full employment. to consistent low long-term real rate, short-term policy rate might low would otherwise well. give global nature decline yields, explanation le center unite state might required. about year ago, i offer thesis "global save glut"--an excess, historically normal real interest rates, desire global save desire global investment--was contribute decline interest rates.7 in brief, i argue shift reflect confluence several forces. on save side, factor include rapid growth high-saving country pacific rim, export-focused economic development strategy directly indirectly hold back growth domestic demand, surge revenue enjoy oil producers. on investment side, notable factor restrain global demand capital include legacy asian financial crisis late 1990s, lead continue sluggishness investment economies, slow growth workforce many industrial countries. so long factor persist, global equilibrium interest rate (and, consequently, neutral policy rate) low otherwise would be. conclusion what conclusion draw? clearly, bond prices, like asset prices, incorporate great deal information potentially relevant policymakers. however, information always easy extract and--as current situation--the bottom line policy appear ambiguous. in particular, extent recent behavior long-term rate reflect decline term premium, policy rate associate give degree financial stimulus high usual. but extent long-term rate influence macroeconomic conditions, include factor trend global save investment, require policy rate lower. give reality, policymakers well advise follow two principle familiar navigator throughout ages: first, determine position frequently. second, use many guide landmark available. in context monetary policy, principle suggest policymakers monitor bond yield carefully judge current state economy--but tandem signal important financial variables; direct read spending, production, prices; goodly help qualitative information. ultimately, robust approach policymaking require use multiple source information multiple method analysis, combine frequent reality checks. by tie policy small set forecast indicators, may sacrifice degree simplicity, le likely mislead favor variable behave unusual manner. 6 see discussion jonathan h. wright (2006), "the yield curve predict recessions," finance economics discussion series 2006-7 (washington, d.c.: board governor federal reserve system, march). 7

comment late--namely, proper role asset price determination monetary policy. otmar i debate issue many occasions, discussions--together recent research carry european central bank, bank international settlements, elsewhere--have challenge stimulating. the preparation talk afford welcome opportunity reexamine think subject. so, today, i review argument evidence i see draw conclusion i currently led. at outset, let stress i express opinions, necessarily share colleague federal open market committee.1 two strategy deal market bubble most fluctuation stock prices, real estate values, asset price pose particular challenge central banks, usual factor influence outlook real activity inflation. but many argue pronounce boom bust asset market another matter, especially actual valuation appear misalign fundamentals. what central bank suspect face major speculative event--one might large enough threaten economic stability unwinds? to help frame discussion, i focus two different strategy propose deal market bubbles. the first approach--which i label conventional strategy--calls central bank focus exclusively stability price economic activity next several years. under policy, central bank respond stock prices, home values, asset price insofar implication future output inflation medium term. importantly, strategy eschew attempt influence speculative component asset prices, treat perceive mis-pricing as, rightly wrongly, essentially exogenous process. follow strategy imply policymakers ignore expect future evolution speculative activity. if policymakers suspect bubble likely, say, expand time collapsing, implication possibility future output inflation need fold deliberations. practically speaking, however, i view ability act suspicion limit give little know dynamic speculative episodes. despite approach perceive speculative activity, conventional strategy recognize monetary policy important influence asset prices--indeed, influence heart transmission policy decision real activity inflation. it occur standard arbitrage channels, link interest rate discount factor use value expect future earnings. 1 david reifschneider, federal reserve board's staff, contribute substantially preparation remarks. bi review 21/2006 1 the second strategy, comparison, activist attempt damp speculative activity directly. it describe length "asset price bubble monetary policy," article publish ecb last year. i quote article: "this approach amount cautious policy 'leaning wind' incipient bubble. the central bank would adopt somewhat tight policy stance face inflate asset market would otherwise allow confront similar macroeconomic outlook normal market conditions. . . . it would thus possibly tolerate certain deviation price stability objective short term exchange enhance prospect preserve price economic stability future."2 i label second approach extra action, call step would take ordinary circumstances.3 compare first approach, extra-action strategy respond perceive speculative boom tight monetary policy--and thus low output inflation near term--with expectation significantly mitigate potential fallout possible future burst bubble. thus, strategy seek trade near-certainty bad macroeconomic performance today chance disproportionally good performance future, theory repercussion major market correction could highly nonlinear. but extra-action proposal mean bold call central bank prick market bubbles. a ecb article stresses, attempt would extremely dangerous give risk concert effort stamp speculative boom would lead outsized interest rate hike recession. rather, extra-action strategy intend provide limit insurance possibility highly adverse event occur road. common grind i talk length difference two strategies, i must stress front much common. both policy aim achieve general objective monetary policy, use broad analytic framework. most central banks, i believe, share basic feature monetary policymaking, notwithstanding important difference official mandate nature economies. at risk considerable oversimplification, policymakers describe seek set policy time minimize present value future deviation output potential inflation desire level. of course, may prepare write specific loss function say, "there, that's i'm minimizing." but deliberative process action seem broadly consistent characterization general problem. this statement true whether institution specific mandate keep inflation low stable output close potential, unite states, whether mandate define primarily term stabilize inflation, euro area. stabilize output complement maintain price stability medium long run, often short run well. we also agree asset price play critical complicate role determine real activity inflation--roles may change time increase share wealth market-determined easily liquified. movement stock price real estate value affect household wealth thus consumer spending. change bond prices, stock prices, exchange rate imply movement cost capital relative price influence investment foreign trade; exchange rate movement also directly affect price good services. finally, asset price affect value collateral thus provision credit, thereby influence aggregate spending. in case sharply fall market valuations, adverse credit-channel effect may even exacerbate deteriorate health bank financial institutions. in sum, asset price influence economy complex subtle way potentially extend period time. finally, i think fair say central banks, face limit understand asset price interaction full economy, engage form risk management deal market boom busts. in part, particular policy consideration never associate single forecast future path output inflation but, instead, large set possible scenario differ odds come pass. while one us formal 2 european central bank (2005), "asset price bubble monetary policy" (1.7 mb pdf), monthly bulletin (april), p. 58. 3 the article's label strategy--leaning wind--has use many year describe standard behavior central banks. give history, i think use term extra action le confusing. 2 bi review 21/2006 bayesian method solve difficult problem, i think policymakers engage least informal weigh various possibility implication set policy. three condition extra action lead good outcome now let turn area agreement contentious issues, one strong bear relative merit two strategies. a ecb article notes, extra action often see type insurance. and insurance policy, buy ask whether expect benefit outweigh costs. a i see it, extra action pay three tough condition met. first, policymakers must able identify bubble timely fashion reasonable confidence. second, must fairly high probability modestly tight policy help check expansion speculative activity. and finally, expect improvement future economic performance would result le expansive bubble must sizable. you may think that, state three conditions, i slant case phrase "reasonable confidence" "fairly high probability." but stick me, i hope persuade probabilistic qualifier need judge merit extra action. for moment, let set aside first condition assume central bank distinguish emerge bubble improve fundamental early stage. what two conditions? should presume limit application restrictive policy would materially restrain speculative boom make eventual unwind le disruptive overall economy? consider u.s. stock market boom mid-to-late 1990s. the boom fuel sustain acceleration productivity accompany rise corporate profits--fundamental change justify major rise equity prices. how high price rise difficult judge real time one, investor central bankers, could sure fast profit would grow future. in event, share price increase justify improve fundamentals. but overly optimistic expectation long-run earn growth drive easy money, i see reason believe extra 50 even 100 basis point fund rate would much damp effect investor belief potential profitability emerge technologies. at present, empirical evidence link interest rate corporate equity valuation errors, oppose standard arbitrage effects. in general, poor understand force drive speculative bubble role play monetary policy. in fact, cannot rule perverse effects.4 again, consider u.s. experience late 1990s. when fomc tighten 1999 early 2000, trajectory stock price actually steepened, equity premium fell--perhaps investor become confident good macroeconomic performance would sustained. since mid-2004, see mark decline bond-term premiums, even fund rate rise steadily. these episode illustrate risk premium often move mysterious ways, count ability monetary policy nudge intend direction. perhaps house market differ equity bond markets. for example, homeowners, may le sophisticate understand economy professional investors, might mistakenly view one-time rise home prices--resulting, say, decline interest rates--as evidence persistent upward trend. if so, monetary ease direct stabilize output inflation might, conceivably, drive real estate value fundamental alone would merit. still, would expect mis-pricing source reverse time interest rate return normal. in event, empirical evidence issue scanty. more broadly, research causal connections, any, monetary policy bubble would seem need would know enough able act linkage much confidence.5 4 from theoretical standpoint, "rational bubble" literature demonstrate rise interest rate might lead rational agent boost growth rate asset price speculative episode. 5 recently, ecb staff economist carsten detken frank smets take laudable first step address issue paper establish basic empirical fact correlation among interest rates, money, credit, asset prices, financial distress, macroeconomic performance. see carsten detken frank smets (2004) "asset price boom monetary policy" (882 kb pdf), european central bank work paper series 364, (frankfurt: ecb, may). bi review 21/2006 3 however, let u suppose situation arise convince tight policy would check future expansion emerge speculative bubble. even then, second condition met, third condition might hold: the expect improvement future macroeconomic performance moderate bubble's expansion may enough offset up-front cost extra action. to explain statement, i note extra action near-certainty weaken economy reduce inflation bubble burst exchange chance good macroeconomic performance future. admittedly, worst-outcome scenario associate unchecked bubble judge sufficiently dire scenario see improbable, risk-averse policymaker might regard expect return extra action insurance worth upfront cost. however, confidence assessment would seem hinge believe effect market correction could markedly nonlinear. proponent extra action often cite increase risk severe financial distress potential source effects. however, without onset deflation, large risk? in recent history, health u.s. financial system remain solid collapse high-tech boom, despite bankruptcy dozen telecom dot-com firms, loss $8 trillion stock market wealth, stress nonfinancial corporate sector. moreover, financial sector develop economy also weather worldwide drop corporate equity value fairly well. of course, nonlinear risk associate collapse bubble may depend initial health financial system, circumstance could worry potential significant financial distress accompany burst bubble, bubble expand further. even cases, however, i wonder whether good prudential supervision advance prompt action clean linger structural problem afterward would good way deal possibility. certainly, close oversight bank system 1980s, include unite states, would leave many economy strong position early 1990s. this lesson absorb supervisory authority around world, evidence successful effort strengthen bank capital financial systems. i agree market correction profoundly adverse consequence lead deflation, illustrate unite state 1929 stock market crash recent experience japan. but follow conventional monetary policy cannot adequately deal threat deflation expeditiously mop bubble collapses. in japan, deflation could probably avoid initial monetary response slump real estate stock market value aggressive; addition, macroeconomic performance would good government deal promptly structural problem bank sector.6 a great depression, federal reserve actually worsen situation allow money supply contract sharply 1930 1931, unwisely attempt prick stock market bubble first place. rather demonstrate need preemptive extra action restrain emerge bubbles, example object lesson concern wisdom central banks' ease promptly aggressively follow market slump inflation already low, head threat pose zero low bound. by so, policymakers able avoid severe nonlinear dynamic deflation. proponent extra action often argue reduce risk hit zero bound, recognize circumstance extra action may actually exacerbate problem. to see this, suppose speculative bubble emerge central bank, operate conventional strategy, raise interest rate keep project output gap close expect inflation desire level bubble bursts. now central bank contemplate take extra action. in low-inflation environment, step would bad idea if, average across possible outcome weight likelihoods, predict moderation bubble tight policy small. in case, expect weaken real activity bubble burst would marginally le severe extra action, inflation would substantially low extra action policy would generate persistent economic slack beforehand. with inflation already start low level, decline would extremely dangerous zero bind would much likely constrain monetary policy bubble 6 see alan g. ahearne, joseph e. gagnon, jane haltmaier, steven b. kamin (2002), "preventing deflation: lesson japan's experience 1990s," international finance discussion paper series 2002-729 (washington: board governor federal reserve system, june). 4 bi review 21/2006 bursts. under conditions, extra action would therefore worsen expect economic performance, improve it. another purport benefit extra action that, raise cost capital firm households, help reduce overinvestment foster speculative booms, thereby make easy economy recover bubble collapses. however, careful exaggerate macroeconomic importance capital mis-allocation. true, u.s. high-tech boom lead overinvestment sectors, waste resource create linger difficulty capital overhang eliminated. but hard see much cost term diminish aggregate productivity, give robust growth output per hour past years. furthermore, even tight monetary policy would damp enthusiasm dot-com firm late 1990s, high interest rate would also lead le house le business investment outside high-tech sector, valuation obviously line fundamentals. thus, mitigate capital misallocation one sector would create capital misallocations elsewhere, make assessment net gain extra action difficult. and, i point out, extra action would idle capital entirely time economic activity fell short level consistent stable inflation. now i would like return first condition, one i sidestep minute ago--the question identify market bubble timely fashion. the ecb article stress identification tricky proposition fundamental factor drive asset price directly observable, productivity acceleration stock market boom 1990s illustrate. for reason, judgment central bank stock home overprice inherently highly uncertain. under extra action, mistakenly identify bubble significant costs. by act mitigate nonexistent problem, central bank reduce real economic activity inflation desire level purpose. admittedly, policymakers, recognize mistake, would presumably want economy run hot time restore previous rate inflation would thereby make initial output losses. but come realization original assessment mistake asset price line fundamental likely take time. and mistake call would reduce welfare needlessly induce fluctuation macroeconomy. time also issue. let u suppose evidence compel policymakers become fairly confident valuation excessively rich. unfortunately, i suspect call would often come late day that, give lag monetary transmission mechanism uncertainty duration bubbles, raise interest rate might actually risk exacerbate instability. the market correction could occur policy tight position extra action enough time materially influence speculative activity. notwithstanding controversial aspect identify bubbles, policymakers may still want warn public possibility asset price misalignment evidence merits. such talk might good prompt investor stop rethink assumptions. and talk much last harm even valuation turn justified--provided, however, word see precursor action circumstance conventional policy would still best approach. to wrap critique, i summarize follows: if identify bubble quickly accurately, reasonably confident tight policy would materially check expansion, believe severe market correction significant non-linear adverse effect economy, extra action may well merited. but even one tough condition met, extra action would likely lead bad macroeconomic performance time achievable conventional policy deal expeditiously effect unwind bubble occur. for part, i dubious central banker know enough economy overcome hurdles. however, i would want rule possibility circumstances, perhaps point future understand asset market economy increased, course action would appropriate. asymmetry moral hazard proponent extra action bone pick conventional strategy, especially relate allege asymmetric nature policy's response asset market boom busts. in particular, claim often make that, base fomc's action past twenty years, bi review 21/2006 5 feed actively work support economy event sharp decline asset market little nothing restrain market price rising, thereby create moral hazard problems. this argument strike misread history. u.s. monetary policy respond symmetrically implication asset-price movement actual project development output inflation, consistent mandate. the convince evidence statement find results: interest rate consistent underlie inflation remain reasonably stable time now, accompany relatively mild fluctuation real activity.7 conventional policy practice federal reserve insulate investor downside risk. whatever might think existence "greenspan put," stock market investor could endure experience last five year unite state conclude hedge downside asymmetric monetary policy. nor, matter, conclude federal reserve act upside: if asset price closely align fundamental late 1990s, policy would almost certainly easier, else equal, aggregate demand would weak hence inflation pressure even mute were. the consideration apply homeowners: all else equal, interest rate high would real estate valuation le lofty; real estate price begin erode, homeowner expect see gain recent year preserve monetary policy actions. our action continue key macroeconomic stability, stability asset price themselves. ironically, one argue extra action may pose significant risk moral hazard. it one thing policymakers raise question relationship asset price fundamental another central bank take action influence valuation direction "appropriate" level. how strategy play central bank take extra action speculative activity continue unabated even intensifies? do policymakers raise rate even level consistent conventional policy and, so, consequence economy? and risk that, take steps, central bank would see investor take partial responsibility asset prices? if so, would pressure central bank support asset price market downturn increase? conclusion my remark today intend salute otmar valuable contribution make year think policymakers around world. otmar, teach much intellectual rigor support central bank contribution economic welfare--and friendship. weigh relative merit extra action conventional policy easy require nuanced interpretation argument evidence, well hard thinking. otmar colleague do advance case extra action, give good intellectual workout--and otmar, i thank that. i hope response provide good workout return. i look forward continue debate especially friendship many year come. 7 a evidence asymmetry, observer often cite claudio e.v. borio philip lowe (2004), "securing sustainable price stability: should credit come back wilderness?" bank international settlement work paper 157 (basel: bis, july). the author purport show federal fund rate unusually low headwind period early 1990s correspondingly high onset 1990 recession. but assessment make relation taylor rule, particularly good description monetary policy period opportunistic disinflation. in event, inflation unite state come steadily first half 1990s, accompany significant economic slack--results seem belie claim policy overly easy. 6 bi review 21/2006 svante öberg: sweden – low inflation economy speech mr svante öberg, deputy governor sverige riksbank, stockholm university, stockholm, 21 march 2006. diagram speech find sverige riksbank’s website. * * * introduction i shall begin thank invitation. it always pleasure come back stockholm university, i student. i work economics professional life. prior take post riksbank i had, instance, under-secretary state ministry finance, director general national institute economic research adviser international monetary fund (imf) washington. i intend use experience give provide long-term perspective current economic situation. my theory day "things good now". i shall cover follow area speech: the first part deal swedish economy slightly long term perspective go back 1960s. there i shall discus episode past 30 year colour perception swedish economy important monetary policy. the second part deal current economic situation current monetary policy. swedish economy 1960-2005 i shall begin description swedish economy period 1960-2005 start picture inflation sweden germany period. inflation high sweden germany long period time. during 1960s le keep pace germany. however, second half 1970s 1980s, inflation sweden several percentage point high germany year. since begin 1990s, inflation sweden roughly germany. sweden become low inflation economy. what, whole, happen since 1960s? to illustrate this, i shall talk episode past 30 year great significance economic development view swedish economy. i able follow economic policy decision-making process connect episode close quarter various post public administration. i would like emphasise personal view development riksbank’s official view. the episode i talk include cost crisis 1970s overheat 1980s, change exchange rate monetary policy, wage formation reform budget consolidation 1990s. the cost crisis 1970s during 1960s, economic growth sweden wad good. gdp growth high level, inflation moderate, unemployment low, foreign trade largely balance public finance strong. i usually look five economic variable try gain impression country’s overall macroeconomic development i return often speech. during 1970s number event occur serious consequence swedish economy. oil price rise substantially 1973, lead much high inflation could consider justify actual oil price. internationally, become start long period low growth. in sweden government invest economic stimulation bridge come economic recession. the central wage agreement sign 1975-76 therefore high level, together wage drift increase employer contribution mean wage cost per hour bi review 21/2006 1 rise total 38 per cent. sweden’s competitiveness thus deteriorate substantially. our labour cost per unit produce industry relation correspond cost country rise around 25 per cent 1974 1977. at time, sweden exchange rate regime fix exchange rate. after world war two, almost western countries’ currency peg unite state dollar, turn fix price gold. the system come force 1944 call bretton wood system. when system break 1973, currency collaboration start number european countries, know currency snake, krona peg currency basket dominate german d-mark. in 1977 sweden leave currency snake krona peg currency basket dollar double weight relation trade exchange. in 1991 krona instead peg european currency unit, ecu. during 1970s, sweden still apply credit foreign exchange regulations. the credit regulation limit banks’ lend foreign exchange regulation limit opportunity move currency, security capital across borders. both type regulation entail limit opportunity efficient allocation capital become increasingly difficult maintain time go by. the credit market deregulate 1985 final part foreign exchange regulation abolish 1989. the idea behind exchange rate regime fix exchange rate inflation sweden adapt inflation countries. economist usually call international inflation function nominal anchor. however, succeed, sweden manage stay even country regard inflation cost developments. the economic policy conduct way economy function 1970s compatible fix exchange rate. this result series devaluations, small one 3 per cent 1976, two them, 6 per cent 10 per cent, 1977, one 10 per cent 1981 large devaluation 16 per cent 1982. overheat 1980s the 1980s thus begin two devaluation 1981 1982. the background end 1970s begin 1980s problematic. gdp growth poor, production actually fell couple years. unemployment rise 3-4 per cent, regard high level. inflation soar level 15 per cent. the current account public finance show substantial deficit. sweden find situation weak real growth twin financial deficits. i take part preparation devaluation 1982, connection change government year. the preparation lead kjell-olof feldt, erik åsbrink michael sohlman. i task make calculation economic development come years, base different economic policy alternatives. two alternative concern expansionary fiscal policy bring unemployment strongly contractionary fiscal monetary policy eliminate twin deficits. in cases, substantial problem remain swedish economy. the third alternative concern devaluation 20 per cent autumn 1982, combine price stoppage peg krona d-mark. the calculation indicate industrial production investment would increase, public finance would improve, current account deficit would disappear, employment would increase unemployment would keep down. after kjell-olof feldt make contact nordic finance minister central bank governors, well german central bank governor, size devaluation alter 16 per cent plan peg krona german d-mark postpone indefinitely. i reason return calculation late 1980s i could observe pretty accurate points, except regard price wage developments. i assume inflation wage increase would adjust downwards international level. for devaluation successful, price wage development must keep devaluation. however, case. sweden inflation rate much high germany every year 1980s. economic policy sufficiently strict 1980s keep price wage increase devaluation 1981 1982. although public sector finance improve substantially, primarily due automatic improvement result number year good growth. while monetary policy strict sense nominal real interest rate keep high 2 bi review 21/2006 level protect krona, time credit regulation abolish 1985, lead huge credit boom increase demand push property prices. the excessive price wage increase lead sweden's cost level deteriorate substantially relation countries. at end 1980s, relative cost per produce unit increase level prevail prior devaluation begin 1980s problem twin deficit current account public finances. the problem aggravate international economic downswing begin 1990s fact household save increase considerably tax reform implement begin 1990s. the property bubble arise wake deregulation credit market burst, result whole swedish bank system verge bankruptcy 1992. large currency flow autumn 1992 make fiscal policy spend cut necessary lead powerful defence swedish krona riksbank interest rate creep stages. in end, necessary give up. the krona allow float, leave peg ecu november 1992, depreciate 20-25 per cent. the conclusion i draw development 1970s 1980s economic policy conduct together function economy period could lay foundation macroeconomic stability good economic growth. price wage formation get hand 1970s, series devaluation create considerable pressure economy 1980s, deregulation credit market trigger large credit boom, could counteract monetary policy detail defend krona’s fix exchange rate, fiscal policy could withstand inflationary pressures. all all, lead repeat crisis finally economic collapse. this lead next three episodes. the reform wage formation before i get changeover exchange rate monetary policy begin 1990s, i want mention two episode contribute make changeover exchange rate monetary policy successful regard bring inflation level comparable countries. these reform wage formation budget consolidation 1990s. at end 1980s become increasingly evident swedish wage formation function manner compatible macroeconomic balance. it common central wage agreement sign 1980s contain price trend guarantees, wage development guarantees, earn guarantees, checkpoint etc., lead price wage push one another upwards increase spiral. on 1 march 1990, government appoint rehnberg commission follow negotiation new central wage agreement labour market act achieve new agreement would contain price clause replace agreement 1990 new agreement 1991 lead radical reduction total wage increases, include wage drift, 1991. base commission’s proposals, stabilisation agreement sign period 1 january 1991 – 31 march 1993 75 per cent labour market, contribute rate wage increase fall around 10 per cent 1990 3 – 4 per cent year 1992 – 1993. after that, however, rate wage increase rise around 6 per cent 1996. in april 1997 i give task deputy labour minister ulrika mess make inquiry wage formation mediation. when i give task, social partner industrial sector recently (in march 1997) sign new cooperation agreement, know industrial agreement, whereby party take joint responsibility wage formation part labour market agree regulatory framework negotiate wage agreements. the agreement follow similar, far-reaching, agreement sectors. at time, substantial part labour market type agreement. the inquiry lead new national mediation office established, task mediate labour dispute act promote efficient wage formation process. the important change opinion third, independent, party establish labour market promote efficient wage formation. the national mediation office task keep up-to-date situation central wage negotiation act ensure macroeconomic consideration take account wage negotiations. the office also give increase power authority act connection central agreement negotiations, instance, bi review 21/2006 3 possibility call party talks, provide mediation even one party oppose mediation postpone industrial action. the wage statistic improved. the national institute economic research give task annually produce report economic condition wage formation. over past 10 year wage formation function much efficiently. nominal wage increase around 4 per cent year average, compare 8 per cent year 1980s. the agreement long contain clause regard inflation wage drift much limited. real wage increase average 3 per cent year average, compare 0 per cent year 1980s. of course, one discus much regulatory framework institutional condition surround wage negotiation mean development relation general condition increase understand inflation target importance low, stable inflation. my belief improve condition succeed monetary policy’s objective maintain price stability. budget consolidation follow change government october 1994, i return ministry finance couple year adviser international monetary fund washington become under-secretary state göran persson. there basically one task agenda; eliminate large budget deficit. the deficit public sector finance amount around 11 per cent gdp 1993. after majority swedish population express support sweden join european union referendum hold autumn 1994, become additional task, well finance sweden's membership eu, cost order sek 20 billion year. the time deal deficit ideal political economic viewpoint. study make oecd indicate powerful budget consolidation process carry connection serious crises, 1990s begin serious recession sweden since depression 1930s. gdp fell three year row, 1991-1993, employment fell 500,000 person three years. at time, let krona float free 1992 lead depreciation krona around 20-25 per cent large increase exports. there thus strong growth demand abroad make easy constrict domestic demand. the budget consolidation succeed beyond expectation. public finance improve deficit around 11 per cent gdp 1993 surplus around 2 per cent gdp 1998. the target aim achieve balance public finance 1998. the major part budget consolidation achieve reduce public expenditure percentage gdp. there considerable similarity problem begin 1980s 1990s. in cases, sweden’s international competitiveness deteriorate large deficit current account public finances. however, major difference development 1980s development 1990s fiscal policy much strict 1990s inflation bring level comparable countries. i since reason go happen confidence restore swedish economy economic policy. despite decision budget consolidation essentially take government parliament autumn 1994, take time various figure believe would succeed. the first international recognition policy come european commission spring 1995. i accompany göran persson brussels give account sweden’s convergence programme giovanni ravasio, one lead economist commission. each member state eu draw convergence programme would show policy intend conduct achieve stable public finances, low inflation low interest rates. the swedish convergence programme aim achieve balance public finance 1998, broad support party parliament exception leave party. ravasio convince programme sustainable. 4 bi review 21/2006 it possible see financial market interest rate differential swedish german long-term bond begin decline spring 1995 swedish convergence programme decide even autumn 1995, approve eu’s finance ministers. for riksbank take begin 1996 short-term interest rate begin cut. the krona still weak 1995 inflation close 3 per cent. i also reason go fiscal policy managed, since leave ministry finance 1997 become head national institute economic research late general director statistic sweden 1999. in june 1999, finance minister bo ringholm appoint ass reform budget process. the budget process reform stage since end 1980s. follow assessment broad political agreement, budget act come force 1 january 1997. it contain regulation on, instance, expenditure ceiling guideline public expenditure. the main conclusion assessment new budget process function well. it contribute public expenditure percentage gdp reduce significantly public sector financial save turn around large deficit surplus. of course, creative account bring public expenditure ceiling, relatively small scale. the changeover exchange rate monetary policy in 1992, fix exchange rate krona could long defended, change float exchange rate, sweden find situation since 1930s. the krona float fix exchange rate could long function nominal anchor monetary policy. in 1993, riksbank specify objective monetary policy inflation measure consumer price index (cpi) effect 1995 2 per cent year, tolerate deviation one percentage point this. the exchange rate monetary policy regime thereby change fix exchange rate regime monetary policy aim maintain fix exchange rate float exchange rate monetary policy aim keep inflation low. the inflation target become new nominal anchor. however, necessary build credibility around new monetary policy inflation target. part work strengthen confidence monetary policy make riksbank independent. at begin 1990s, riksbank begin independent. in 1990 change principle under-secretary ministry finance would chairman riksbank’s general council. during change government 1991 1994 riksbank governor replaced, previously accept rule. membership eu 1995 carry requirement adapt swedish legislation eu’s regulatory framework. during year 1996-97 commission inquiry investigate grant riksbank formal independence 1998 broad political agreement would granted. in 1999 riksbank formally receive independence, executive board make monetary policy decision statutory inflation target. the changeover exchange rate monetary policy riksbank’s increase independence important condition bring inflation level correspond countries. this development support budget consolidation wage formation reform. sweden low inflation economy, cost crisis overheating. over past 10 years, inflation vary zero three per cent annual rate inflation expectation stabilise around 2 per cent year. international inflation also low now. both eu oecd area, inflation close 2 per cent year. the major distinction difference inflation sweden country declined. we inflation rate comparable germany. thing also look good regard 1970s 1980s. during 1960s mid-1970s, sweden enjoy high growth, exception individual years. this follow period early 1990s growth low vary considerably. some year even negative. over past ten year enjoy good relatively stable growth. if compare period 1970-1993 past twelve years, observe bi review 21/2006 5 growth much high latter period low inflation (almost 3 per cent year) early period high inflation (almost 2 per cent year). real wage also develop good past ten year interim period high inflation, despite fact nominal wage increase lower. during 1960s mid-1970s, real wage rise every year, i.e. wage rise rapidly prices. then follow period 20 year real wage rise average. since mid-1990s, enjoy period rise real wages. high productivity growth contribute this. the current account show large surplus. public finance also show surplus, although reach target 2 per cent economic cycle. on hand, unemployment high before. during long period begin 1990s, unemployment low sweden. open unemployment vary 1 4 per cent. in recent years, vary 4 6 per cent, follow peak 9 per cent 1997. when i study economics university, teach low inflation link high unemployment. this relationship illustrate phillips curve. however, late research show long term connection inflation unemployment. at time, i believe problem 1970s 1980s could partly explain swedish economy unable manage low unemployment without excessive price wage increase ensuing. for me, one important task economic policy come year bring unemployment. however, riksbank unable much this. the riksbank’s contribution safeguard inflation target way create favourable condition growth employment. all all, picture still swedish economy function much good past ten year 1970s 1980s. thing good now. current monetary policy the part presentation concern economic development current monetary policy reason executive board riksbank decide recent monetary policy meet 22 february 2006 raise repo rate 0.25 percentage point 2 per cent. the riksbank’s view economic development come year present inflation report, publish time interest rate decision. this part presentation contain new information new assessment relation february inflation report separate minute executive board meeting. in light picture economic development outline february inflation report, riksbank conclude reason gradually move towards neutral monetary policy. although inflation currently low, development real economy strong capacity utilisation increases, inflation expect approach target 2 per cent. raise repo rate 0.25 percentage point therefore appear reasonable. the rate continue adjustment monetary policy depend usual information received. to understand aim monetary policy, necessary aware monetary policy normally impact relatively long time lag. it aim current low inflation rate, expect inflation rate couple year ahead. one must also take account fact even raise repo rate 2 per cent, monetary policy still expansionary. during entire forecast period, repo rate expect low consider average key rate long term, lend expect continue increase relatively strongly, even interest rate rise. in opinion, information receive recently significantly change picture outline inflation report. the national account fourth quarter last year slightly weak expected, time, outcome previous quarter revise up, gdp growth year 2005 whole expected. inflation slightly low expect january, february inflation slightly high expected. the move three-month average labour force survey february show largely picture labour market development interest rate decision based. 6 bi review 21/2006 conclusion in conclusion, i would like return theme talk, namely thing good now. of course problem now, course one discus whether monetary policy provide little le stimulation. however, long-term perspective i try provide today, i believe sweden much good economic situation problem year mid-1970s mid-1990s. we regulatory framework exchange rate monetary policy, fiscal policy, promote macroeconomic stability good economic growth. it important safeguard regulations. bi review 21/2006 7 mark w olson: be bank still special? remark mr mark w olson, member board governor u federal reserve system, annual washington conference institute international bankers, washington, dc, 13 march 2006. * * * thank invite speak today. over past twenty years, i attend many institute international banker (iib) spring conference washington, d.c., either speaker participant. these meet continue address interest pertinent issues. the consistently large number attendee meet washington, oppose meet one dynamic international financial center like new york los angeles, reflect group's clear recognition public policy direct impact viability respective institutions. appropriately, topic present two day cover legislative regulatory issue intermix critical strategic issues. for presentation, i revisit topic initially raise twenty-four year ago former president new york federal reserve bank, e. gerald corrigan. in 1982, jerry corrigan, president minneapolis federal reserve bank, write essay entitle "are bank special?" bank's annual report. today i would like revisit issue ponder question "are bank still special?" i realize may wonder focus specialness domestic u.s. bank industry would appropriate topic meet foreign bank representatives. there several reason subject relevant group. first, u.s. law regulation foreign bank adhere fundamental principle national treatment. that is, regulation allow foreign bank range product authority domestic banks. therefore, change policy affect domestic bank also potentially affect range product foreign bank may offer. another reason issue likely interest audience that, discussion product authority regulatory structure, experience nation often use examples. these example often present policy practice avoid emulated. but accuracy fact present support oppose countries' experience always clear. at times, "facts" may undocumented generality even wild speculation. let return corrigan's essay. in 1982, bank industry face identity crisis unlike face since depression era fifty year earlier. within period month mid-1930s, congress (1) require separation bank many security function pass glass-steagall act, (2) provide protection bank depositor pass federal deposit insurance act, (3) authorize creation dedicate home mortgage lender pass home owners' loan act. through laws, congress establish legal framework clearly delineate competitive relationship securities, banking, thrift industry close fifty years. this delineation extend marketplace bank security industries. during period, issue controversy bank security firms, notable exception narrowly focus heat disagreement whether bank allow underwrite revenue bonds. the glass-steagall act specifically authorize bank underwrite general obligation bonds, act silent issue revenue bonds. the bank industry view oversight; security industry view purposeful exclusion. this debate go unresolved 1999, gramm-leach-bliley act specifically authorize revenue bond underwrite banks. in contrast relative peace bank security firms, competition deposit bank thrift quite strong intensify imposition regulation q. not regulation q establish ceiling interest rate passbook save account certificate deposit (cds), regulation give thrift interest rate advantage initially 50, 25, basis point interest-bearing products. the intense marketplace competition bank thrift match level competition hall congress. banker aggressively work eliminate quarter-point rate differential, thrift work equally hard preserve it. such widespread competition nonexistent security bank industries. from 1930s late 1970s, seem clear distinction investment save least investment dollar save dollars. save dollar hold passbook account cds, insure certain limit federal deposit insurance corporation (fdic) federal save loan insurance corporation (fslic) insurance. investment dollar bi review 20/2006 1 equity bonds. bank thrift wag turf war other, neither industry aim market gun lobby effort security industry. then along come money market mutual funds, money funds. high interest rate late 1970s early 1980s stun effect flow deposit bank thrifts. money fund share issue investment firm offer market interest rate high level liquidity, either immediate withdrawal ability effect transaction use

many banker last response marketplace change would require removal regulation q. banker seek answer basic question "what bank?" "what public purpose banking?" jerry corrigan's essay prove beacon rationality discussion. be bank special? corrigan identify three characteristic make bank special: - bank bank offer transaction accounts. that is, "they incur liability payable demand par readily transferable owner third parties." that transaction account authority help "to insure financial disruption spread." back also deposit insurance access discount window, bank "reinforced public confidence essential healthy economy." - corrigan's second criterion identify bank critical backup source liquidity. in fact essay state "banks primary source liquidity class size institutions, financial nonfinancial." - the third characteristic corrigan identify bank "are transmission belt monetary policy. that role combine operate payment mechanism permit highly efficient financial market function effect orderly end day settlement." corrigan go address question "what bank," question complicate different definition different laws. the federal deposit insurance act define "bank" differently bank hold company act did, distinction allow commercial entity fdic-insured bank narrow product offer meet bhc act test. (the competitive equality bank act reconcile definition 1987.) if bank special, corrigan stated, limitation service line business bank could offer justified. further, service business allow owner bank reflect nearly symmetric way, service bank allow offer. corrigan make remarkably prescient observation, gramm-leach-bliley act would pass seventeen year late essentially adopt last criterion determine type corporation could banks, activity could conduct corporations. between publication corrigan's essay passage gramm-leach-bliley act, market forces, support either regulatory interpretation court challenges, continue blur line banking, securities, insurance industries. a capital market expanded, mutual fund put pressure bank deposits. in europe, foreign bank success security activity suggest bank conduct activity safe sound 2 bi review 20/2006 manner. but 1999, legislative response basic marketplace change broad question separation bank commerce. separation bank commerce the appropriate separation bank commerce delicate proposition historical philosophical underpinnings. the term "separation bank commerce" mean different things, depend perspective person use term. at time corrigan's essay--the early 1980s--the statutory authority separation largely contain two laws: glass-steagall act, separate commercial bank certain investment security activities, bank hold company act (with amendments), narrowly limit activity corporation allow banks. when pass 1956, bank hold company act think response one company's aggressive expansion bank activities. that company, transamerica insurance, expand several western state concern raise result concentration financial resources. therefore, ensue body law commerce bank issue concentrate significantly separating, inspire desire separate, bank security bank insurance. from time corrigan's essay passage gramm-leach-bliley, bank industry expand substantially security insurance agency fields, though significant restriction still remained. much industry's expand security authority gain federal reserve's approval security underwrite banks, section 20 glass-steagall act. under federal reserve's rule, bank subsidiary "not engage principally" security underwrite first 5 percent, 10 percent, ultimately 25 percent revenue come underwriting. this expand authority allow many bank organizations, though almost exclusively large banks, significantly expand domestic security activities. these power extend foreign bank operate unite states. in insurance, gain bank industry largely result court determination annuity could underwrite sell banks. court determination also expand national banks' ability market insurance products. consequently, bank size expand involvement insurance annuity activities. by 1999, bank bank hold company gain significant additional product authority security insurance, area perceive side bank commerce wall time corrigan write essay. a number factor persuade congress federal action appropriate, gramm-leach-bliley act passed. congress learn security insurance experience foreign banks, high point low points. on one hand, institution european country successfully broaden security insurance activities. on hand, linger question whether pacific rim bank closely link certain commercial enterprise region, thus facilitate asian financial crisis late 1990s. however, u.s. bank industry also develop improve way manage risk, bank supervision become effective. in addition, improve analytical capacity offer new technology, good coordination among domestic international bank supervisors, healthy track record u.s. banks, growth consolidate home-country supervision across world help u.s. bank affiliate expand commercial activities. the response congress essentially threefold. first, move separation wall bank commerce reflect already occur marketplace: gramm-leach-bliley also address broad question type business could affiliate bank allow company banking, securities, insurance entity within structure know financial hold company. second, congress provide way bank gain new-product authority new product determine financial nature, incidental banking, complimentary exist bank authority. third, clearly separate federally insure entity--either bank thrifts--from new potentially higher-risk new-product authorities, gramm-leach-bliley reaffirm matter public policy bank continue regard special. but act offer clear acknowledgment separation bank commerce bright line instead negotiate compromise--one continue move market change product refined. the guide consideration compromise protection federal deposit insurance fund. bi review 20/2006 3 be bank still special? much change bank landscape since corrigan write essay twenty-four year ago. significant increase international capital flow among bank nonbank entities, addition broad range specialize financial instrument mean bank long consider source transaction accounts. except access federal reserve discount window, bank long dominant provider liquidity financial industries. but bank remain key access point dominant wholesale payment network, still provide federally insure check save deposits. with rise new financial services, products, techniques, moreover, bank expand role provide liquidity indirect ways, example, securitization loan backup commitment securitization vehicle capital-markets instruments. even bank may "special" unique provider particular market, bank prove formidable competitor innovators--which reinforce banks' importance proper function financial system. in short, public's trust confidence bank continue vital financial well-being. bank provide considerable credit aftermath september 11 attacks, financial flow slow operational problems. to sure, bank able provide credit part huge injection liquidity provide federal reserve. but key role bank crisis: obtain funds--through discount window open market operations, necessary--and channel need funds, base assessment creditworthiness. banks' access discount window payment system, well ongoing relationship customer credit-evaluation skills, allow play role. during crisis, bank play critical role payment system especially important. a result, bank expect resilient. though bank small role transmit monetary policy, still help transmit policy action arbitrage federal fund market money markets. conclusion a strong case make bank continue special. and special, we, regulators, continue apply high standard company seek bank charter. we must also continue examine supervise bank safety soundness. likewise, appear congress take cautious approach determine type company may affiliate banks. but bank must also compete marketplace. consequently, expect time see adjustment direct activity bank line separate bank commerce. history is, sense, drawing, re-evaluation, re-drawing lines. a matter public policy, change trail rather lead marketplace, change must inform careful study role want bank play economy need marketplace. 4 bi review 20/2006 jean-claude trichet: interview d standard, de standaard, la tribune, süddeutsche zeitung l'echo an interview mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank, conduct m birgit baumann (der standard), mr luc coppens (de standaard), m isabelle croizard (la tribune), m helga einecke (süddeutsche zeitung) m catherine mommaerts (l'echo), publish 15 march 2006. * * * after second ecb rate hike, repeat monetary policy still accommodating. at level interest rate become neutral, i.e. neither stimulate brake economic activity. when i report decision ecb’s govern council raise interest rate i say decision reflect assessment time. it still assessment. our assessment clear. we decide ex ante series monthly increase rate do central banks. the govern council ass risk price stability necessary counter risk increase. we refer notion theoretical “neutral rate”. we refer mandate, deliver price stability credible deliver price stability time. it treaty call u people europe clearly ask u do. by so, also contribute financial environment favourable growth job creation euro area. when i say monetary policy stance accommodating, confirm number observations: real short-term interest rate close zero; nominal short-term interest rate low euro area since second world war, example german bundesbank never go low 2.5%; abundant liquidity euro area monetary aggregate grow twice fast growth gdp. businessmen complain ecb’s rate hike come early might put economic recovery euro area risk. how ecb cope criticism? what mandate command u do. but mandate contradiction growth job creation. i tell why: order preserve level medium long-term market interest rate exceptionally favourable growth job creation, solidly anchor inflation expectation level fully line definition price stability. we precisely demonstrate observers, investors, saver 313 million fellow citizen euro area whatever necessary deliver price stability. if credible so, medium long-term market interest rate would much higher. this well understand european global observers. by deliver price stability also contribute reinforce consumer confidence. we tell consumers: “look, protect preserve present future purchase power’’. to sum up, doing, i.e. faithful mandate, allow present euro area recovery sustainable medium long run. the growth rate europe seem unable reach potential. should ecb therefore become financial watchdog? our present assessment current trend growth rate euro area around potential growth rate, take account volatility quarterly figures. we see whether economic growth accelerate, whether cope other, new shocks. we constantly assess situation pragmatic way, base fact new information receive. let add something important: good monetary policy necessary condition growth job creation, sufficient itself. we also need sound fiscal policy, bold structural reform appropriate monitor competitive indicators. this responsibility stakeholder part overall result. the political leader give sharp reaction first rate hike december, second march. do convince meantime explain that? the ecb totally fiercely independent, read treaty european union. it credibility base upon independence. that credibility precious asset permit u bi review 20/2006 1 today exceptionally favourable medium long-term interest rates. i trust increasingly well understand partner euro area. do recovery germany help ecb govern council decide last rate hike? a know, look situation euro area whole. the significantly positive signal various german survey important, germany large national economy euro area. we see present period recovery develops. we quite number good signals. these signal encourage euro area confirm trend recovery likely around growth potential. that said, pragmatic. we look facts, figure data, stand ready incorporate future assessment. what risk price stability see, exception oil prices? we see number risks. some associate increase price oil commodities. these increase progressively incorporate price good service energy intensive. we another set risks, associate indirect tax increase administer prices. furthermore, risk “second round” effects. this mean economic agent may incorporate price set wrong assumption high headline inflation due oil price increase last medium long run. these risk “second round” effect particularly significant regard wage salaries. we precisely ensure price stability medium term. to date, see risk materialise, prevent them. once second round effect materialise, late. signal risk medium long term deduct monetary analysis. for example, loan private sector grow quite rapidly. you say commit series rate hikes, two hike make cycle. can expect scenario similar 1999 2000, seven rate hike row? we decide ex ante series rate hikes. it important convey message, otherwise observer might think decide raise rate every meeting, do another important central bank. at time, i say never embark pre-commitment – necessary counter risk identify. that increase rate december, january february, increase rate march. i don’t want say anything else. one thing sure: observer understand decide priori increase rate necessary ensure price stability. and trust us. this trust perhaps precious asset. can today speak house market bubble euro area? the development loan finance house form part information receive monetary analysis monitor closely. if take full body whole euro area level outstanding credit house dynamic, exceed 11% growth yearly basis. that figure post despite fact german real estate market remain depressed. that mean that, part euro area, even rapid development situation. so call close monitoring. at stage, i sum present understand situation: something important monitor closely. it naturally part information take account decide increase rate last meeting. but i would also add that, level euro area whole, economy take account, i wouldn’t say presently alarmed, diagnose immediate danger bubble. i would say information call close monitor continue follow development carefully. but difference countries. how cope that? again, level govern council ecb one instrument, single monetary policy. if situation different country country, case, instruments, particular national levels, hand governments, parliament and, cases, national central bank country concerned. however, clear that, far concerned, domain, well others, single monetary policy instrument. what appraisal seven year since euro launched? when think best play role monetary shield? 2 bi review 20/2006 the euro incredible success. human nature big success, tend forget it. the success able deliver 313 million people level monetary confidence, monetary credibility, low medium long-term market interest rate previously privilege part euro area. all consider many impossible “ex ante”. i participate run euro i vivid memory many observer believe even 1997 1998: fact could succeed benchmarking euro credible currency euro area consider quasi impossible endeavour. we succeed meet promise make authorities, include central banks, people euro could good, solid credible currency previous national currencies. i proud, predecessor wim duisenberg, able go country euro area tell people: “you currency fulfil promise made”. the launch euro suppose accelerate process economic union fiscal harmonisation. how explain lack progress and, worse, apparent rejection euro many large new member state european union? let remind figures. today, 25 country member eu and, quite soon, 27. of 25 countries, two “opt out” clause regard euro. in future, 25 27 country “opt out” clause. and two economy opt clause – uk denmark – denmark follow closely monetary policy euro area. now let give figure exchange rate mechanism 2. when i first arrive head ecb, one participate currency, danish krone. now, number participate currency eight. i observe freeze situation, quite contrary. the euro facilitate completion single market also push direction structural reform major endeavour european general. it mean fully satisfy present situation. it clear domain structural reforms, more, much more. we give strong back initiative take recently european commission, leadership mr barroso, re-launch lisbon agenda. if look country implement well fully structural reforms, see success stories. ireland, particular, remarkable success story, regard full employment gdp per capita. denmark, de facto euro area, make structural reform labour market, prove efficient. we fully back trend reforms. it important communicate efficiently possible convince public opinion successful way fight unemployment promote growth. part need structural reform sector-based imply cross-border merger acquisitions. be completely discouraged, example, french government’s recent attitude suez-gaz de france case dominique de villepin’s call economic patriotism? the ecb’s govern council didn’t discus particular dossier relate cross-border merger acquisitions. in past, govern council always refer full completion european single market. a matter principle, govern council think opportunity cost associate non-completion single market. let’s forget new endeavour. the single act launch endeavour single market mid-1980s. in 1958, treaty rome ratified, idea produce common market size usa benefit economy scale. the ambition already clear 50 year ago: free circulation men women, good service capital european union. austrian finance minister karl-heinz grasser, chair ecofin first half 2006, claim eu member state achieve balance budget 2010, think that? it good goal. we always call rigorous implementation stability growth pact. you remember call drastically change rule domain, even abandon pact. we always say pact crucial element emu. the stability growth pact much “e’’ emu. we federal government, federal budget, single currency. in order coherent, emu need stability growth pact. the three percent threshold, i proud introduce negotiations, mention stability growth pact also refer treaty. i often answer question, whether three percent would opportune difficult situation economy could use extra push. that would keynesian bi review 20/2006 3 argument: spend, activate economy. but besides argument, economist call “ricardian effect’’. david ricardo rightly state great deficit becomes, investor consumer alike start realise deficit sustainable long run. somebody pay it, either high market interest rate tax increases. entrepreneur become nervous slow investments, consumer start save spend less. so economy slow job lost. the budget go red, strong ricardian effect becomes, outweigh keynesian argument deficit spending. that stability pact also growth pact. slovenia new eu member state ready euro. do think join 2007 expected? we see. i don’t want anticipate result report ecb commission publish may. we check whether criterion stipulate maastricht treaty fulfil sustainable basis. after seven years, argument leave convince british join euro ? it british people decide. a know, past, british prime minister say clearly interest britain join time comes. i’m also convince this. when compare britain ireland, see good arguments. however, even without uk, number 313 million people euro area. with otmar issing’s departure, last pioneer first ecb-management leaving. what do institution last eight year challenge lie ahead you? otmar issing marvellous member executive board. our institution, ecb, design credible time irrespective staff changes. the ecb credible accord information extract observers, market participant financial sphere. the successive member executive board part continuity institution. i confident trust solidly based. do think lucas papademos would marvellous successor otmar issing chief economist? we take together, six us, decision responsibility executive board, time comes, new colleague. the federal reserve system new chairman, ben bernanke. what kind man expect relationship predecessor, alan greenspan? it important close relationship federal reserve system. it case consistently past years. at time terrorist attack unite state 11 september 2001, i mention several time exceptional confident real-time dialogue federal reserve system, permit u take appropriate decision regard potential liquidity risk exist euro dollar side

extraordinarily well receive global community, observer market participants. i full confidence we’ll continue same, close friendly relationship federal reserve system. do think federal reserve system

bank financial service authority ireland, luncheon meet eu head mission french embassy, dublin, 9 march 2006. * * * introduction i welcome opportunity talk today thank ambassador grasset invite me. high level gather this, opportunity exchange view freely important european issues, invaluable i look forward hear view later. in brief address, i touch follow issues: experience relation economic growth inflation development euro area, recent decision govern council relation interest rates, risk euro area economy face go forward development eu country outside euro area. economic development i would like begin talk euro area economic performance prospects. after many year disappointment, economic recovery prove weak hesitant, sign become encouraging. economic activity euro area improve growth outlook, still far vigorous, favourable time. why economic recovery previously disappoint apparently pick up? these question i turn address and, so, shed light factor shape monetary policy environment recent years. look back, euro area slow participate global economic recovery has, less, ongoing since middle 2003. until recently, recovery activity euro area, follow protract period slow growth mid-2001 mid-2003, relatively weak compare experience recovery period past decades. up now, euro area growth ebb flow recovery evolve smooth sustain fashion would usual stage economic cycle. a number factor account sluggish nature recovery recently. first, unlike early episodes, current recovery evolve background sharply rise energy price significant appreciation euro. while impact rise oil price activity mute typically case past, high oil price heighten uncertainty act something headwind recovery lack great momentum. a second problem disappoint performance consumer spending. there doubt much hold consumption back. employment wage growth modest. high volatile oil price dampen influence. in addition, save level remain high, reflect concerns, relation labour markets, also longer-term prospect health-care pension systems. thirdly, recently, corporate sector euro area engage period balance sheet restructuring, response sharp rise corporate debt occur part late 1990s dotcom boom. a problem existence significant structural rigidity euro area labour product markets, see many hold back growth euro area economy. not surprisingly, give background, economic recovery euro area slow take recent years. the problem normal sequence recovery, tend run, first, pick export growth, recovery investment and, finally, strengthen consumer spending, operating. while external engine fire strongly, domestic engine not. more recently, however, development become encouraging. follow four quarter moderate growth mid-2004 mid-2005, sign euro area growth gather momentum. while quarterly growth rate somewhat volatile second-half last year, look short-term fluctuations, evidence suggest economic activity improving. of course, external trade continue provide significant impetus growth euro area. however, also sign improvement domestic demand. business confidence strengthen significantly since last summer, contribute bi review 19/2006 1 welcome recovery investment. the improvement investment reflect favourable external stimulus, also impact improve business balance sheet efficiencies, well rise profitability. however, progress remain slow relation consumer spend – main element domestic demand. while consumer confidence pick recent months, consumer spend growth remain subdued, though one two sign improvement. look ahead, view govern council condition remain place ongoing economic expansion euro area. a favourable external environment continue provide support exports. investment also benefit still favourable finance conditions, improve business balance sheet gain corporate earnings. on consumer side, spend likely grow gradually broadly line development incomes. the recent ecb staff macroeconomic projection point somewhat improve growth outlook year next compare past two years. take mid-points ranges, projection foresee economic growth around 2 per cent 2006 2007, compare 1.4 per cent last year. while take time, slowly euro area economy return towards trend growth rate. inflation development have speak activity developments, i turn talk inflation development prospects, move talk monetary policy. the headline rate inflation (hicp) euro area remain 2 per cent recent years, mainly result strong increase energy price and, less extent, rise administer price taxes. however, underlie domestic inflationary pressure relatively subdue and, overall, pass-through past oil price increase consumer price limited. the subdue growth domestic demand recent year help explain limit ability producer pass-on increase input cost consumers. another important factor respect moderate wage growth, which, turn, reflect subdue nature labour markets. it background govern council able keep interest rate unchanged historically low level two one-half year june 2003 december 2005. maintain price stability – monetary policy decision why then, might ask, give background, govern council twice raise interest rate past three months? the answer lie gradual upward creep inflation risks. in course 2005, inflation projection progressively revise upwards, mainly, though exclusively, reflect strong expect increase oil prices. reflect this, year progressed, upside risk maintenance medium-term price stability view gradually increasing. this assessment reinforce evidence monetary analysis, point strong monetary growth, ample liquidity rapid expansion credit – especially consumer credit, notably housing. by end 2005, evidence economic monetary perspective adjustment accommodative stance ecb’s monetary policy warranted. therefore, 1 december last, govern council decide increase interest 25 basis points. with risk outlook inflation remain upside early month 2006 late staff projection suggest that, unchanged interest rates, hicp inflation would probably remain 2 per cent year next, increase interest rate recently deem warranted. with respect two decisions, i would strongly emphasise points. in raise interest rates, occasion, govern council respond risk price stability perceive them. a president trichet state emphatically, govern council take ‘ex ante’ decision engage mechanically series interest rate increases. i would emphasise govern council pre-commit unconditionally future action. our approach consider up-to-date information analysis economic monetary situation prospect act accordingly. i would also emphasise govern council stand ready whatever necessary ensure maintenance price stability act anchor medium long-term inflation expectations. the smooth reaction recent interest rate increase suggest market understand underlie rationale. 2 bi review 19/2006 ongoing risk i would like turn make brief remark main risk outlook growth inflation lie ahead. i begin oil prices. not high volatile oil price threaten slow growth, also raise risk high inflation essential ensure second-round effect wage price-setting behaviour avoided. in long term, difficult say price oil might evolve. however, recent oil price strength would appear reflect combination strong demand, lack spare production capacity uncertainty surround supply. this make likely high oil price persist time yet ongoing risk oil price could rise potentially combine negative factor cause protract problem global euro area economies. oil price external factor complicate outlook. there also risk pose widen global current account imbalances, show sign abating. the seemingly ever-increasing u current deficit imply potential significant volatility foreign exchange market continue one important downside risk growth. there also risk within. in particular, reflect stimulative effect low interest rate monetary aggregates, see persistently strong growth money credit. this point potential risk price stability medium long-term. we mindful risk continue monitor development closely. another internal issue fiscal policy. while go difficult period, revise stability growth pact good economic rationale, degree flexibility could misused. with economic growth prospect improving, country excessive deficit need use “good times” make progress towards sound public finance (i.e. maintain attain budgetary position close balance surplus) set sound consolidation plans. these consolidation effort effective part comprehensive reform programme, include set concrete measure need prepare long-term fiscal challenges. development outside euro area finally, i would like say word development non-euro area eu countries. enlargement european union truly historic event occur smoothly. the economy new member state benefit greatly accession continue converge towards rest eu impressive pace. crucially, drive strong growth productivity, reflection extensive structural reforms. this support strong growth exports, underpin capital inflow allow wage increase quite robustly without give rise inflationary pressures. a result, inflation rate generally decline remain moderate, even long period sustain economic growth sharp increase oil prices, though inflationary pressure become evident couple cases. central bank new member state deserve good deal credit manage inflation expectation effectively disguise difficulty face, overheat ever-present threat. fiscal policies, hand, could instance stem domestic economic pressures, notwithstanding need modernise public infrastructure. current account deficit generally high i would see largely reflection convergence process. in cases, however, moderation import demand would welcome. the main exchange rate development entry seven currency erm ii past two years. a high degree exchange rate stability achieved, currency trade either close central rate euro. this facilitate convergence process allow interest rate decline while, time, help anchor inflation expectations. furthermore, prove inflation target fully consistent membership erm ii economy sufficiently flexible policy largely supportive. there couple instances, however, inflation rate rise sharply. i would reiterate importance fiscal policy regard point particular fiscal stance add demand pressure economy already grow rapidly. otherwise, twin objective exchange rate stability price stability could come conflict. the new eu member state make considerable stride along path towards membership euro area clear euro area expand sooner rather later. i would like comment likely outcome convergence examination advance upcoming convergence bi review 19/2006 3 report european central bank european commission. however, worth reiterate eurosystem commit accord country equal treatment go before. at time, single path towards euro adoption country assess case-by-case basis. assume criterion satisfy condition met, i look forward expansion euro area, least maximise benefit single european market eu citizens. conclude remark in conclusion, euro area eu, live challenge change times. however, also many opportunities; must exploit full extent, order live standard citizens. in euro area, first time long time, appear see sustainable economic recovery emerging. this welcome development govern council ensure recovery take place environment price stability. in wide eu, process monetary integration set continue. a euro area country, i assure glad see new member join ready meet condition membership. thank attention. 4 bi review 19/2006 y v reddy: financial sector reform financial stability speech dr y v reddy, governor reserve bank india,

non-financial sector balance sheet well governments. bi review 19/2006 1 financial sector reform stability national authority typically adapt design financial sector reform - pace, sequence direction ambit - country-specific situations, mindful threat financial stability. the relevant consideration may summarize here. first, substantial consensus, back historical cross-country evidence, strong complementarity financial stability macroeconomic stability. second, key issue design financial sector reform pace reform context ensure financial stability. opinion remain sharply divide choice big-bang approach shock therapy cautious gradualist strategy. on balance, appears, reform need introduce process short-lived event process move fast enough produce reasonable result without run risk disruption short run. third, case gradualist approach adopted, question arise optimal sequence reform secure financial stability. such sequence crucial ensure inter-sectoral balance avoid chance disproportionality. fourth, reform process, however, pace sequenced, consistent financial stability widely perceive temporary lack credibility. in market-based environment, expectation economic agent extremely important economic decisions. the reform process succeed economic agents, especially investors, believe reform enduring. the issue credibility inter-related choice pace reform. our experience graduate pace win credibility since avoid disruption roll-backs short run time allow beneficiary build consensus favour continue reforms. a key issue manage expectations. there reason believe financial reform process india greatly aid strengthen reinforce financial stability. the financial sector acquire strength absorb shocks, largely facilitate regulatory actions. the financial

also equally important minimize risk instability, experience show desirable pace financial liberalisation often follow financial instability crises. avoid crisis ultimately national responsibility. the approach manage financial sector, choice instrument time sequence policy matter inform judgment, give imponderables. current context some think issue financial stability current context, perhaps order. low growth accompany high inflation nightmare central banker. high growth couple low inflation indeed central banker's dream. i reason happy, consider growth inflation number india now. so brother sister central banker seem similar positive trends. however, currently almost every central banker globalise world keep wonder whether night ahead continue dream run so, run steam. the concern central banker today arise describe stable disequilibrium - every day add potential disequilibrium continue stable. the perceive risk arise mainly global imbalance outlook oil prices, particularly light emerge geo-political situation. most market participant seem sense risk sentiment appear reflect price risks. risk disappear get transfer another part system. the macro policy emerge market particular factor risk continuously balance financial sector reform stability considerations. more important, 2 bi review 19/2006 regulators, monitor risk lie become difficult due emergence large conglomerates, sophisticate market instrument derivative presence player like hedge funds. the good news international cooperation among central banker mitigate impact risks. the actuary certainly help process analyse risk insurance sector affect large segment population fact seek minimize risk insurance. let conclude thank organiser provoke think aloud share think subject common interest u

geithner, president chief executive officer federal reserve bank new york, japan society corporate luncheon, new york city, 9 march 2006. i would like thank margaret mcconnell bank’s research statistic group valuable contribution speech. * * * we midst another wave global economic financial integration. this movement toward great openness associate rise capital mobility offer prospect substantial economic gain u.s. global economy. strong real financial linkage across nation potential significantly raise prospect long-run world growth. the ensue development market sector emerge

transition large share work age population world bring market. but process change economy financial market interact also complicate task central banks. our understand change affect capacity forecast economic activity inflation ability ass monetary policy affect economy almost certainly lag change underway. in remark today, i talk implication challenge conduct monetary policy. i focus two feature happen world economy financial market today among interest consequential many question face today think change world economy task central banking. these are, first, behavior forward interest rate

speaker fearless expound personal vision europe. i study number recent speech mr. klaus set vision europe. the point i shall make aim contradict distinguish speaker merely stimulate debate. a small country, luxembourg staunchly express confidence european integration deeply attach welfare state. a also seat european institutions, follow debate "our europe" great interest poll show people spot europe good inform aware european matter elsewhere. president klaus strong view europe beg differ mainstream thinking, european constitution belief "a new constitutional document created". read recent publications, seem president klaus’s view anchor two-pillar philosophy (like ecb policy strategy) • first pillar traditional divide individual collectivity, private sphere public sphere, • second pillar appropriate level deliver public goods, european level national one. on first pillar describe "as conservative economist politician… read mises, hayek friedman … follower true believer". a view compare former prime minister margaret thatcher also oppose conservative liberalism mainstream conservative idea embed idea social market economy. president klaus consider latter think lead "a

unemployment, loss competitiveness, age european population, crisis pension system health-care systems, insufficient quality education, problem immigration multiculturalism root freedom-constraining welfare system. these view often reflect among economic observers. martin wolf recently write financial times: “there something rotten welfare state europe. the time come european ask unthinkable:

chairman board governor u federal reserve system, independent community banker america national convention techworld, la vegas, 8 march 2006. the reference speech find board governor federal reserve system’s website. * * * good morning. i please join today discus matter mutual interest federal reserve community banks; learn business; and, i hope, meet many person. community bank long play critical role u.s. economy, le true twenty-first century. today, i begin make observations, base part research do federal reserve elsewhere, health community bank evolve role economy. community bank generally quite well, i expect good performance continue. but community bank also face change business environment present number important long-run challenges. in second portion remarks, i speak bite federal reserve, supervisor many community banks, also adjust change environment, i review key financial risk face community banks. development community bank by wide variety indicators, overall performance community bank recent year quite strong. average return equity (roe), example, follow decline associate 2001 recession, remain solid indeed show slight upward trend. return asset community bank whole demonstrate similar pattern stay well traditional benchmark strong performance. net interest margin remain high large banks, gap even widen since 2003. various measure loan quality community bank robust, bank failure rare. equally important, on-site examination off-site surveillance system, us statistical model attempt flag emerge weakness community banks, detect sign potential problem banks. consistent view, community bank capital ratio remain impressively high, community banks' ability attract deposit continue source strength. one strong indicator continue health community bank rate new bank continue created. for example, define community bank bank thrift organization total real (2002) asset billion dollar less, slightly 700 community bank form begin 2000 2005, average 120 per year. clearly, many people remain will invest future community banking. the board long take view community bank remain vigorous innovative sector economy. i think forecast remain good one today. all good news. but i sure many audience would agree community bank also face serious challenges. expansion geographic scope bank activities, rapid technological change production financial services, increase importance nonbank providers, evolve pattern economic growth among factor change bank marketplace. and, many change improve efficiency financial system low cost consumers, realistic acknowledge also present new sometimes daunt test community banks. indeed, see major shift structure u.s. bank industry recent decades. under definition community bank i use moment ago, share bank industry asset hold community bank fall 20 percent 1994 little 12 percent 2005. in addition, number community bank drop 10,000 1994 7,200 2005. other definition community bank structural measures, share total deposits, also show decline recent years. bi review 17/2006 1 most consolidation result mergers. a recent study member federal reserve board staff show 1994 2003 3,500 bank thrift merger (pilloff, 2004). in 92 percent mergers, target institution one billion dollar le total assets. although bank merger activity generally decline since late 1990s, least 200 deal complete year 2000 2005. the evolution relationship finance these development notwithstanding, research staff economist support view community bank continue play important role provision financial services, particularly small businesses, also wide range retail customer nationwide. indeed, conventional wisdom research community "the central principle community bank 'relationship finance'" (deyoung et al., 2004, p. 81). by relationship finance i mean financial service whose value-added depend importantly ongoing personal interaction banker customers, interaction improve flow information allow customize services. relationship finance strengthen economy allow credit financial service provide efficiently. but recent research also confirm many community banker tell us--that traditional notion relationship finance changing, along nature community bank-customer relationships. the conventional research paradigm include idea small business household tend informationally "opaque"; is, information potential borrower costly obtain hard quantify. accord view, efficient supply credit party require close interaction elicit "soft," qualitative, information, personal characteristic borrower relevant aspect local market opportunities. this paradigm hold large bank comparative advantage lend relatively transparent customer obtain "hard," quantitative, information, standardize account data, community bank comparative advantage lend relatively opaque small business households. however, division labor large small institution begin blur. today, practitioner researcher understand low-cost information processing, improve credit-scoring, sophisticate management technique rapidly reduce effective opacity many small business households. credit card lend provide example phenomenon. technological financial innovation, include credit scoring, securitization, economy scale data processing, combine make credit card lend hard-information, transactions-driven business, quite different traditional unsecured personal lending, rely heavily personal knowledge relationships. some recent data board's forthcoming survey small business finance shed light marketplace, role community banks, changing. the board conduct survey every five years. our recent data, still preliminary release late year, year-end 2003; result interview 4,200 small business represent estimate 6.3 million small business unite states. the survey show small business heavy user financial services. for example, proportion business use type financial service bank thrift rise 92 percent 1998 96 percent 2003. increase occur across broad range financial service especially strong area "financial management services," include activity check clearing, cash management, letter credit, credit card processing. accord surveys, community bank remain important provider services, albeit increasingly competitive marketplace. among small business report use bank thrift 2003, 37 percent use community bank, 42 percent 1998. over period, share small business use financial service supply nondepository institution rise 40 percent 54 percent. although survey show community bank face increase competition, include nondepository providers, also highlight importance one traditional strength community banks: local presence. for example, 2003 median distance small business's headquarter bank thrift three miles, 1998. indeed, part success nondepository institution may due fact median distance small-business customer nondepository service provider fell 83 mile 1998 2 bi review 17/2006 37 mile 2003, change result great proximity customer nondepository loan providers. be close convenient important. data collect part bank agencies' community reinvestment act (cra) activity also demonstrate importance proximity. a know, cra focus banks' lend service provide within local communities. from cra data, estimate share loan small business make depository institution locate physically within local market area. these data show 1996 (the year begin collect data) 2004, competition out-of-market lender increased, result surprise you. however, value terms, share small-business loan make out-of-market firm exceed 18 percent year. small-business owner look overwhelmingly local lender credit. we see that, community banks, overall picture complex. in financial terms, community bank remain quite strong, considerable entry business. new technology management method erode traditional informational benefit relationship finance, however, community bank lose market share large bank nondepository institutions. but data also show many customer want serve locally; value proximity convenience. in view, strong relationship personalize service provide community bank remain important reason continue success. supervisory perspective like community banks, bank supervisor must also adapt change financial economic environment. i would like discus way federal reserve's supervision community bank evolve recent year also briefly review key financial risk see examinations. in 1990s, bank supervisor begin take proactive, risk-focused approach. under approach, examiner focus on-site review activity appear pose great risk individual bank organization, particular attention bank's procedure evaluating, monitoring, manage risks. the objective address weakness management internal control before, rather after, financial performance suffers. in adapt change, federal reserve bank agency also consistently keep view competitive pressure community bank face, pressure make cost regulation important concern. whenever possible, streamline procedure work eliminate unnecessary burden. for example, base industry feedback supervisory experience, federal reserve recently modify small bank hold company policy statement raise asset size use define eligible company $150 million $500 million. these revision address change industry economy since initial issuance policy statement 1980. while bank hold company (bhcs) affect hold 6 percent total bhc assets, change increase exempt group roughly 85 percent bhcs, thereby provide burden relief many small companies. these company exempt consolidate risk-based capital guideline allow file abbreviate semiannual report place consolidate quarterly financial statements. under policy statement, exemption would extend hold company significant nonbank off-balance-sheet activity material amount public debt equity security outstanding. of course, bank agency vigorously enforce prudential capital standard deposit-taking institutions, include own exempt bhcs. supervisor seek adjust regulatory procedure account need community bank organization ways. a doubt aware, tandem review capital standard large banks, know basel ii, federal bank agency take comprehensive look additional possible change exist regulatory capital guideline bank would adopt propose basel ii revisions. these possible change basel i would seek increase risk sensitivity framework help mitigate competitive inequity could result implementation basel ii. the recent update cra regulation provide another example regulator take account special feature community banks. last year, federal reserve federal agency issue final cra rule reduce compliance burden create new category intermediate small bank asset $250 million $1 billion. bank new category face reduce requirement data collection reporting, become eligible bi review 17/2006 3 two-pronged set cra tests--a streamline lend test community development test--rather three-part cra criterion large bank must meet. these change intend reduce cost bear small bank increase flexibility still achieve community development objective cra. to target examination resource limit burden on-site reviews, federal reserve also increasingly rely automate off-site monitor tools. for example, since late 1990s, federal reserve supervise many small bank hold company use off-site review program. we support program target monitor system seek identify parent company nonbank issue may adversely affect affiliate insure depository institutions. this program enable u limit on-site review bank hold company characteristic could pose risk insure depositories. we also use statistical model monitor condition state member bank quickly address issue emerge regularly schedule on-site examinations. this year, substantially update model improve performance. thank large part efforts, examiner today conduct supervisory activity offsite, help reduce burden associate on-site examination institution like yours. beyond changes, federal reserve participate ongoing interagency review bank regulation pursuant economic growth regulatory paperwork reduction act, know egrpra. this review seek identify opportunity streamline regulatory procedure requirement change would consistent maintain bank safety soundness. the board also support various legislative change would ease regulatory burden. these include recently propose change would permit supervisor extend time on-site examination eighteen month well-managed well-capitalized bank $500 million assets. this change would double current size threshold potential allow roughly 1,200 community institution qualify extend examination cycle. in remain time, i would like discus key financial risk-management challenge identify supervisory activities. bank always business take manage risks, evolve market economic condition affect type opportunity available. in recent years, community bank become focus commercial real estate lending, lead significant shift balance sheet risk profile grow number banks. in local markets, commercial real estate loan perform well. our examiner tell u lend standard generally sound comparable standard contribute broad problem bank industry two decade ago. in particular, real estate appraisal practice improved. however, recently, sign ease underwrite standards. the rapid growth commercial real estate exposure relative capital asset raise possibility risk-management practice community bank may keep pace grow concentration may due upgrade oversight, policies, information systems, stress testing. in response developments, federal bank agency recently propose guidance would focus examiners' attention loan particularly vulnerable adverse market conditions--that is, loan dependent primarily sale, lease, refinance commercial property source repayment. i emphasize that, propose guidance, supervisor aim discourage bank make sound loan commercial real estate loan category. rather, affirm need bank recognize risk arise concentration place appropriate risk-management practice capital levels. adjust change level short-term interest rate also pose challenge community banks. thus far, relative stability community bank net interest margin suggest do good job manage interest rate risk exposure throughout recent increase market rates. importantly, community bank effectively control maturity distribution asset make significant improvement past decade management measurement interest rate risk. certainly, procedure employ community bank today significantly effective typically use recently decade ago. however, continue see small number institution concentration longer-term assets. in cases, examiner encourage bank gauge risk new yield-enhancing strategy intermediate long terms. 4 bi review 17/2006 the unique fund structure community bank support strong recent performance. for part, community bank continue fund primarily relatively low cost stable "core" deposits. however, limit segment community bank increase reliance wholesale source funding. great reliance source place premium appropriate measurement management liquidity risk. most community bank manage liquidity risk position well, supervisory review suggest institution room improvement. with bank system enjoy period relatively high liquidity, good time company ass adequacy process manage liquidity risk. i emphasize that, whole, broad supervisory concern community banks. but prudent reiterate importance sound risk management continue success community banks. conclusion in closing, i want return i began. in judgment, well-managed innovative community bank continue play critical role u.s. economy. community bank provide vital service customer key contributor sustain economic growth, locally nationally. indeed, performance community bank past decade impressive. but neither banker supervisor become complacent. doubtless future continue require u evaluate respond change often complex difficult understand, much le predict. it pleasure today, i look forward work come year ensure continue vitality u.s. bank financial system. thank you. bi review 17/2006 5 ewart s williams: a brief overview development trinidad tobago open remark mr ewart s williams, governor central bank trinidad tobago, launch intercommercial trust & merchant bank limited, port spain, 16 february 2006. * * * i delight share celebration i believe rebirth intercommercial trust merchant bank limit (itmbl). let extend sincere congratulation board, management staff intercommercial bank limit trust merchant bank. the rebranding intercommercial trust merchant bank go – stand-alone status; new, restructure entity; new location, situate port spain, middle financial centre, – carry enormous significance. it send message ibl full-fledged national financial institution which, support strategic partners, will take competitor locally regionally. lady gentlemen, significant event take place important juncture country’s economic financial (history). in 2005, trinidad tobago register twelfth consecutive year robust economic growth; inflation still basically check; strong balance payment unemployment perhaps low point ever. while much success trace oil fortunes, also several year sound economic policies, liberalization financial sector significant part. this re-launch intercommercial trust merchant bank take place time see full benefit financial sector liberalization. this reflect proliferation diversify range financial institution exponential growth financial asset base. with structural change ongoing financial sector, trinidad tobago become major source regional financing, home-based financial institution expand presence caricom region. despite rapid pace expansion, bank system remain robust, evidence main macro-prudential indicators. the data shows, example, that: (i) bank adequately capitalized, capital adequacy ratio average close 20 percent, far exceed statutory 8 percent minimum; (ii) non-performing loan bank system, whole, region 2 percent, come markedly double-digit level prevail nineties; (iii) provision reassuringly high level, coverage ratio relative non- perform loans, exceed 61 percent; (iv) bank record strong profit average return asset vicinity 3.5 percent. the intercommercial bank much part extraordinary period development financial sector, bear process financial liberalization, dominate mid-1990s. from inception, ibl unique institution. while initial capital may foreign, essentially local bank local management, emerge long three local commercial bank get difficulty need liquidated. a such, creation ibl strong affirmation part founders, confidence economy financial sector trinidad tobago. from outset, ibl face severe challenge – small bank, competition much large long establish banks. it enjoy economy scale go size moreover, regional bank, central trinidad, without national reach large banks. against background, fact ibl survive prospered, credit founders, board management staff bank, substitute, efficiency service quality financial strength. with commendable insight management ibl, early bi review 17/2006 1 game, stake strategic market niche focus core banking, gear meet personal business need small thrive geographical area. ibl unique another sense – turn conventional caricom order head. over last year proliferation crossborder ownership caricom region. however, invariably, mean trinidad tobago bank expand wing abroad. the acquisition ibl jamaica money market broke reflect reversal dominant order. today, stake ibl cmmb, among others, jmmb become important player regional financial markets. the re-launch intercommercial bank trust merchant bank limit affirmation ibl consolidate position core bank business feel secure enough, confident enough strong enough spread wings. the re-launch also timely business viewpoint place bank position participate burgeon capital market, rival traditional bank sector institution prefer source business financing. it certainly help intercommercial trust merchant bank would capital market experience jmmb cmmb rely on. over last five year value sovereign bond placement trinidad tobago amount $16 billion private debt issue amount $10.5 billion period. also, rapid diversification economy, trade project financing, commercial paper various form structure finance typical merchant banks, increasingly become important source fund business activity. so good case re-entry merchant banking. however, merchant bank challenges. a bankers, know dependence diversify fund source money market instrument long-term foreign currency borrow invariably risky dependence vanilla deposits. on asset side, secure loan advances, standard fare commercial banks, carry low risk investment likely dominate balance sheet merchant banks. in short, shift merchant bank create demand new competencies, new system new governance risk management structures. a know, evolve structure financial system also create new challenge central bank regulator. we currently address challenge through: (i) transform supervisory system integrate risk-based framework; (ii) strengthen overall legal regulatory infrastructure, line international best practices. in particular, implies, inter alia: (i) ensure institution – big small – adequate governance system place; (ii) insist enhance report disclosure standards; (iii) put place procedure share information regulator locally regionally; (iv) ensure financial institution strengthen risk management practices. in context, bank work amend capital adequacy rule ensure major risk appropriately identify mitigated. i impress mission statement intercommercial trust merchant bank – champion financial development prosperity individual company adhere core value honesty, integrity, openness, respect love. this indeed laudable mission. but i sure know succeed, face challenge least among reality face competition rivals, great financial strength tremendous advantage head-start. but ibl, parent institution, face similar challenge overcame. i certain help strategic partners, jmmb cmmb, would survive thrive hopefully grow word “the admire financial service organization”, trinidad tobago, region. 2 bi review 17/2006 once again, let congratulate board, management staff intercommercial trust merchant bank extend best wish success. bi review 17/2006 3 michael c bonello: the challenge face maltese economy ahead euro adoption implication monetary policy interview mr michael c bonello, governor central bank malta, the times, 2 march 2006. * * * 1. it report malta need real growth rate 4 per cent per annum reach eu average per caput gdp 20 years. growth, fact, average 0.5 per cent real term five year 2005. be preoccupied? more important express concern need understand reason slow growth. since turn century economy face challenge external domestic origin, recent period weakness reflect size task ahead. the slowdown begin 2001 external shock key sector tourism semi-conductors. since relatively slow growth malta’s main trade partner compound competitive pressure unleash globalization integration single european market, force acceleration pace restructure manufacture sector. at time open markets, low-cost producer undercut competitiveness, particularly labour intensive sectors. these, along sharply high price import oil since last year, among factor contribute slow down. in long run change bring globalization correction economy’s structural imbalance enhance growth prospects, coincidence two event make difficult transition. it also true economy could good prepare cope shocks. that, however, would require great degree foresight timely reorder priority allocation scarce resources. regrettably, national governance system conducive achievement consensual solution issue longterm implications. this explain process reform tend rather slow outcome often le ideal. the persistence rigidity product labour markets, partial wage indexation system, failure anticipate consequence demographic trend insufficient investment physical infrastructure human resource early year reason economy lack flexibility react external development successfully competitors. this mean economy head right direction. appropriate policy indeed place several key areas, policy coherence improve finance available implement national reform programme. this much acknowledge eu commission imf. a restructure process move on, moreover, industrial sector increasingly compose resilient firm produce high value add products, new, important source output growth emerging, financial ict-related services. i, therefore, believe grind cautious optimism, provide persevere. it will, however, take time; easy short cut fast growth. 2. eu accession mean boost trade. in fact, export 11.3 per cent 2005, although eu’s share edge slightly 51.5 per cent. don’t tell problem eu economy, ... first, let’s get fact right. while malta’s export fall 11.3% last year, export eu 5.2% lower. the drop, moreover, entirely due reduce sale electronic good clothes. sale product category eu increased. and forget malta also increasingly exporter services, include numbers. second, real world hardly ever case thing either black white. for start, prove fact membership single market, particularly presence monetary union, result mark expansion intra-market trade. that experience exist eu euro area members. it reasonable, however, expect happen first full year membership! exploit new market opportunity take time institutional structure bi review 16/2006 1 operate practice need adapted. some fund malta get eu use precisely strengthen economy’s export potential. at time, also true eu economy grow rapidly anticipate 2005. it expand 1.6 per cent, compare 2.3 per cent 2004. a high proportion ever consumer demand, moreover, satisfy import competitive producer expense establish suppliers. finally, i already observed, persistence sluggish growth maltese economy cannot explain exclusively term cyclical downturn. delay implement effective competitiveness-enhancing reform also factor. a result, economy fully prepare exploit single market. 3. in circumstances, isn’t bad time strait-jacketed condition euro adoption? wouldn’t fiscal boost speed economic growth, already limit monetary policy tool put shed? allow first correct two misconception implicit second question. for start, monetary policy tool put away available use needed, case april last year bank’s central intervention rate raise 25 basis points. the primary objective monetary policy, moreover, influence level economic activity. it maintain price stability, pursue operation fix exchange rate. we, therefore, use monetary policy tool first instance provide support currency. now question echo view argue delay adopt euro, government would able spend run high budget deficit would meet deficit criterion year, thereby help economy grow faster. it sound attractive, would work? first, argument base premise increase government spend produce job growth. in small, open economy, thing simple. if money spend infrastructure projects, increase import raw material inputs; money remain malta form wages, high proportion also spend imports. these leakage diminish benefit economy multiplier effect increase spending. thus, example, calculation suggest government invest lm18.5 million 2005, keep deficit 2004 level, gdp would around lm14.5 million high last year. against benefit, moreover, one would set costs. for example, high deficit mean increase public debt equal amount, thus annual interest pay recurrent revenue. besides, reason i give earlier, high deficit translate wide trade gap (by estimate lm7.5 million example). proponent government spend also bear mind even absence euro adoption factor, malta would still abide stability growth pact (sgp). you might recall even british government, immediate plan adopt euro, call order eu council time ago grow budget deficit. then again, sound public finance fundamentally matter economic common sense prudence. so much recent year repeat call government quarter reduce deficit public debt. be strange, therefore, headway finally make direction, hear call reversal policy engineer would best short-term boost growth? one also bear mind malta’s main challenge become internationally competitive. in respect, increase fiscal deficit solve anything. malta need quality growth, preferably result foreign direct investment, bring capital, technology markets. and kind investment tend go country sound economic fundamentals, include budget balance course business cycle. more immediately, renege convergence programme targets, would real risk drop investor confidence. this confirm recent development interest rate bond market central europe, market start punish country risk delay euro 2 bi review 16/2006 adoption. it indeed relevant point malta’s current ‘a’ rat predicate upon continue pursuit fiscal consolidation. there additional short-term gain stay course. a i mentioned, fiscal restraint also help reduce country’s external imbalance, this, turn, could allow cut interest premium investor require order hold maltese lira assets. this would mean low interest rates. on balance, therefore, outcome u-turn fiscal policy unlikely positive. 4. last year’s entry erm ii describe hasty premature. why rush join euro? doe rule possible adjustment value lira? one argument make support view euro adoption calendar allow government run high deficit thus promote fast growth. i explain i convince argument. a claim decision enter erm ii hasty premature, suggest recklessness! no, rush. the decision make thorough consultation eu commission european central bank (ecb) light progress achieve malta fiscal consolidation structural reforms. their agreement contingent firm undertake maltese authority continue implement convergence programme. a relate objection adopt euro malta first satisfy test similar set british economy chancellor brown. this argument betray insufficient familiarity chancellor’s five tests. they are, fact, different maastricht criteria, malta, together six new member state currently erm ii, seek satisfy. the five test relate convergence (like maastricht criteria); flexibility labour, product capital market (being address malta’s convergence programme); investment, i.e. whether euro encourage inward fdi (the british treasury’s 2003 report suggest does); financial service (this apply special case city london); growth, stability employment. malta’s strategy document, publish jointly government bank last year, argue euro would beneficial respect (and treasury report). the case adopt euro sooner rather late set strategy document. i shall reiterate small, open economy like trade capital controls, keep separate currency leaf u expose external shock volatile capital flows. we thus oblige maintain large amount external reserves. these financial asset could perhaps earn high rate return invest domestically. instead, invest abroad, effect promote foreign, rather domestic growth. that price pay independent currency. this vulnerability indeed one main reason lead academic field believe small new member state allow lock relatively great security euro area quickly possible. the validity view underscore malta’s experience late 2004/early 2005 bank’s external reserve decline result uncertainty create speculative comment exchange rate. your second question reflect view fix nature exchange rate well level lira peg euro erm ii inappropriate stifle malta’s competitiveness. let first address issue fix peg. this mainstay monetary policy three decades. it maltese trader investors, public large, become accustom to. the result exchange rate price stability make vital contribution country’s economic development. opt new unfamiliar regime, 15 per cent band arrangement amount to, midst uncertainty prevail early last year would prudent. the decision opt continuity peg lira euro central parity rate, moreover, also support study equilibrium exchange rate, available bank’s website, produce evidence significant misalignment; conviction – share expert opinion malta abroad – give openness economy speed nominal exchange rate pass-through prices, possible devaluation anyway unlikely last beneficial effects. the 1992 experience prove devaluation correct antidote bi review 16/2006 3 structural problems. in le three years, inflationary pressure result decision wipe whatever competitiveness gain achieved. in event, commitment keep lira/euro peg central parity rate – also welcome imf - seem reassure business community investor calm return financial markets. the downward trend reserve first interrupt reversed, capital inflow resumed, include considerable amount result redenomination domestic loan euro take advantage low interest rate. in circumstances, allow exchange rate adjust market pressure within 15 per cent band, currency would appreciated. 5. you seem play efficacy fiscal deficit exchange rate adjustment mean jump start economy. what would suggest instead? a i already point out, domestic factor contribute economy’s anaemic growth record largely microeconomic nature. i also explain deficit finance change nominal exchange rate cannot correct weaknesses, still le produce sustainable growth. policy orientation must eschew short-term palliatives. like competitor must learn come term globalization. reflect one simple fact help understand means: hourly cost labour electronics operative malta around $11, compare $7 singapore $2 china. neither government spend devaluation narrow gap. against background, maintain external competitiveness long run depend continue moderation wage growth, fast increase labour productivity sustainable budget positions. i make claim originality propose prescription; share eu commission, ecb imf. i shall first address last objective. give taxation level already high, fiscal consolidation achieve cut recurrent spending. here i would focus reduce public sector wage bill, mainly low employment levels, government currently doing; reform provision pension health care; rationalize social welfare schemes, include eliminate benefit outlive usefulness extend mean testing; transform unemployment benefit system effective instrument employment creation rather social dependence. with regard competitiveness-related problems, need address remain rigidity labour market – include ensure wage cost reflect productivity levels; invest education provide suitable incentive unleash potential inherent country’s human resources; improve business environment, particular low cost operate malta. while beyond dispute country undergo significant change good first year new century, equally true world around u become much dynamic place meantime, competitive pressure unless adapt rapidly, accept low live standards. 6. euro yield rise yet leave central intervention rate unchanged… this prof limit monetary policy tool put shed, put early question! we still degree autonomy. a i say earlier, exchange rate nominal anchor monetary policy. the rationale regime, i.e., provide support currency, indeed require u mirror interest rate offer currency – primarily euro since move full peg last may – , addition also need offer premium holder maltese lira asset compensate small size vulnerability economy. our judgement appropriate size premium point time, complement consideration relate financial market sentiment economic condition generally, determine decision bank’s central intervention rate. the market far judge interest rate premium lira appropriate. 4 bi review 16/2006 7. it would ironic government meet fiscal criterion euro adoption, fail inflation rate. what interest rate policy bank adopt regard? i already explain focus monetary policy fix peg regime exchange rate. unlike country float regime, inflation targeters. the bank’s ability influence price level directly power change short-term interest rate money market is, therefore, rather limited. to extent, however, rise inflation associate development put pressure exchange rate shape persistent loss external reserves, surge consumer import finance credit creation, high interest rate could cool effect. in malta’s open trade environment, one would expect price respond effectively market force seem case. the relatively small number importer essential commodity provider service significant weight retail price index disadvantage respect. there governmental agency whose responsibility ensure competition price transparency prevail. contain local costs, include government-induced costs, also priority crucial erm ii phase. in capacity advisor government, bank take every opportunity express concern may regard. 8. in addition short-term pressure maastricht criteria, longterm reality welfare gap. be frustrate pace pension reform? a sense disappointment best sum feelings. i consultation consensus building, time come decision need take damage avoided. this apply equally social welfare health system pensions. last year first cohort baby-boom generation reach retirement age. this produce acceleration lm7 million rate increase pension expenditures. pension reform, vital long-term sustainability public finances, implement year. everybody say comprehensive, balance set proposal answer wide possible range concern compatibly viable system. it time move press issues. 9. property value continue increase background rise volume bank credit channel construction house purchase. be grind concern? property value estimate increase 9% 2005. although represent slowdown previous years, still excess recent inflation occur despite continue high vacancy rate. the ready availability credit contribute rise property prices. while volume bank credit construction industry le flat last year, borrow finance construction purchase house go 21% lm653 million. these numbers, moreover, must view context total household borrowing. consumer credit, include credit cards, increase 13% 2005 lm91 million. this area bank market product rather aggressively, encourage borrow consumption rather investment purposes. one concern this, particularly time slow growth household disposable income, result increase consumer debt burden. for default rate household borrowing, particularly mortgage loans, remain low, much low fact corporate sector, exist prospective borrower may factor calculation repayment capacity possibility interest rate might remain current low level indefinitely. while exuberance take hold property market recent year appear moderate somewhat, similar phenomenon emerge equity market. the optimism drive share price support strong corporate profitability cases. current trends, however, take price territory connection intrinsic value become le obvious, suggest caution. bi review 16/2006 5 10. economic analyst sound gloomy warn keep push authority right direction, ring bell proclaim good news risk undermine sense determination needed. which approach would advocate? neither two. there already much spin create purveyor pessimism optimism alike become increasingly difficult get balance read economic situation. independent economic analysts, therefore, shoulder heavy responsibility. it bring together relevant information, subject critical objective assessment, prepare support conclusion well document arguments. this role bank endeavour play consistently, good reason. the people understand economy works, challenge face limit option available overcome them, great likelihood policymakers feel comfortable take require decision promptly, lead fast pace wealth creation, one thing want. 11. the adoption euro greatly reduce role central bank malta. what january 2008? your question reflect perception commonly hold bear experience current member euro area. it would correct say bank’s role greatly change rather reduced. some exist function become le important, others so, yet others created. on institutional level, transfer responsibility monetary policy ecb would replace governor’s participation govern council interest rate set euro area. for purpose, need strengthen capacity area economic research, forecast statistic redirect focus. this also apply activity support monetary policy, open market operations, would conduct within parameter set ecb. in area foreign exchange, would long need provide marketmaking facility euro become domestic currency, retain current foreign exchange facility offer government exist level. our reserve management role, however, would remain; manage reserves, also manage part ecb’s portfolio. likewise, bank would retain function issuer note coin would thus meet local demand euro. it would also need analyse suspect counterfeit euro note coins. particularly important bank’s role provide channel domestic cross border, high value payment link payment system eurosystem’s target, well operate mechanism cross border delivery asset collateralisation purposes. the adoption euro also integrate malta’s financial system euro area, bank’s financial stability internal audit responsibility assume cross border dimension weakness one member state could impact directly stability entire system. for example, cooperate closely central bank ecb prevent emergence systemic crises. this involve strengthen institutional analytical capacity detect potential vulnerability financial system. a audit role, provide internal control assurance ecb function carry behalf. all this, course, important implication essential support function information technology human resources. i need mention fact euro area membership entail considerable electronic report obligation maintenance several statistical databases. the bank gear take new, specialize functions, i would like note able confidence substantial core qualify dedicate professional areas. 6 bi review 16/2006 ewart s williams: the caribbean money market broke - impact trinidad tobago feature address mr ewart s williams, governor central bank trinidad tobago, launch caribbean money market broke composite lead indicator, trinidad, 24 january 2006. * * * let begin thank manage director caribbean money market broke (cmmb) invite share occasion afford opportunity address word distinguish gathering. let hasten well congratulate cmmb yet another important initiative. in five short year existence, cmmb make significant impact economic financial scene trinidad tobago. it enhance operation capital market introduce new approach liquidity management financial institution firm well; cmmb also make contribution expand financial education research activities, help investor understand capital market better. this morning’s occasion mark another important initiative cmmb. the introduction composite lead indicator development economy add important piece information statistical base. this indicator represent enhancement information set available analysts, market practitioner decision maker include central bank. accordingly, i warmly commend cmmb’s efforts. the international financial crisis mid late 1990s underscore fact globalization put premium availability timely, reliable comprehensive data. unfortunately, many develop countries, include trinidad tobago, address critical statistical requirement systematic way. while good official statistic valuable public resource national context, role guide formulation public policy give even great importance develop countries, impact public policy decision tend amplify presence large economic social imbalances. good statistical systems, therefore, tend provide relatively high social return country trinidad tobago. over years, trinidad tobago develop fairly good set basic statistics. we produce standard annual national income accounts; good energy sector data; price employment index good quality; timely fiscal account (at least central government); good monetary, financial balance payment data; reasonably complete information public sector debt. but need go beyond present database. trinidad tobago undergo rapid transformation, process demand great role market force foster competitive environment efficient resource allocation. for us, complementary data beyond core statistical data series mention needed. last year, join long list develop country subscribe imf general data dissemination standard (gdds). we work actively meet high standards, special data dissemination standard (sdds), adopt develop emerge market economies. give responsibility policy maker regulator financial system, central bank claim high average stake development statistical base. our new monetary policy framework – centre around repo rate - place high premium ability accurately measure pulse economy point time anticipate short term trends. very often difficult task sufficient information available timely basis. the bank try close gap introduce new series. for example, introduce quarterly gdp estimates, export import price indices, well new indicator export competitiveness. we currently work development range indicator build cost real estate price well comprehensive estimate consumer spend private indebtedness. bi review 16/2006 1 large capital flow become important element economic landscape trinidad tobago. these flow significant consequence exchange markets, abrupt variation (in either capital inflow outflows) signal impend problems. the central bank work closely private financial institution trinidad tobago security exchange commission (sec) collate reliable data capital account balance payments. for country access international capital markets, like trinidad tobago, reliable timely data along transparent statistical practice basic requirement. important institutional change currently train central statistical office (cso) strengthen organization’s autonomy enable good fulfill mandate. the key restructure plan transition institution executive status (similar central bank) implementation measure build operational capacity, include strengthen human resources. these institutional change need accompany use modern techniques. nowadays, information provider engage active deployment web-enabled technology facilitate collection dissemination information. in trinidad tobago, however, data compilation system still largely base manual form web-based form would improve speed data collection dissemination. we also need change culture towards provision statistical information. it need start government agency state enterprise tend see compilation record way facilitate analysis, bother. the private sector also need recognize value provide data even may imply slight inconvenience. the private sector assure accept statistical standard require data individual firm publish individually order protect confidentiality. the launch cmmb composite lead indicator (cmmb cli) important development, provide flash estimate current economic trends. the indicator easily understand base set readily available series. the indicator could, principle, useful analysts, investor businessmen alike, would give additional piece information central bank base monetary policy decisions. that cmmb, private sector institution, move fill important need; positive development. it underscore fact business develop statistical information cso central bank responsibility economic stakeholders. i call trade association industry group follow example. let congratulate cmmb worthwhile initiative. you establish new standard among private financial institution term provision timely relevant information decision making. additional effort like would go long way strengthen country’s statistical infrastructure. 2 bi review 16/2006 mario draghi: financial market integration intermediation save address mario draghi, governor bank italy, 12th congress aiaf - assiom - atic forex, cagliari, 4 march 2006. * * * 1. the world economy: expansion imbalance the world economy enjoy period strong widespread expansion. despite sharp increase price raw materials, inflationary pressure remain moderate. yet respect remain fragile. the expansion begin 2002 thank recovery unite state support china’s boom economy. it gain strength middle 2003 onwards, average annual rate growth rise nearly 5 per cent, spread gradually, unevenly, every region world, although somewhat weak form europe. in italy, stagnate 2005, economy show sign recovery. there still uncertainty, however, extent durability country’s economic growth, continue weigh unresolved structural problems. world economic activity benefit persistence stable financial condition exceptionally propitious investment. apart expansionary stance monetary budgetary policies, contributory factor integration financial markets, development emerge regions, spread efficient instrument management risk progress make field crisis prevention financial supervision. the economic upswing generate strong demand oil, especially china emerge asian economies. despite increase supply, demand meet difficulty rise prices. the price oil double real term since spring 2003. so far pressure pass core inflation, remain moderate everywhere, testify credibility gain monetary policy lead countries. this credibility precious need preserved. it reason, especially euro area, monetary condition continue relaxed: interest rate remain near low level ever. the monetary credit aggregate continue expand rapidly; price real asset high; restrictive impulse come exchange rate. keep inflation expectation firmly anchor level consistent price stability essential economic growth creation jobs. the increase key rate decide thursday govern council ecb serf purpose. although world economic expansion widespread, accompany large external imbalances. these cause divergence growth domestic demand main region massive transfer resource oil-consuming oil-producing countries. the u external deficit increase since middle 1990s, although cause change years. initially, reflect capital formation associate spread new information technology. boost increasingly good prospect growth, consumption also rise fast disposable income. the current account deficit finance thank massive inflow private capital, attract high yield expect stock market, especially high-tech securities, appreciation dollar exacerbate trade deficit. in 2001 determinant current account deficit begin change. in face risk recession, monetary fiscal policy make expansionary. the save rate continue decline. consumption sustain rise value property; households’ propensity save turn negative 2005. the federal budget balance deteriorate 6 percentage point gdp 2000 2004 show another large deficit 2006. the manner finance external deficit also changed. the inflow private capital slow 2002 2004. the dollar come downward pressure, despite much large purchase monetary authority country current account surpluses. such purchase liable undergo rapid change. in 2005 country reduce accumulation official reserves, china record massive increase. however, widen short-term interest rate bi review 15/2006 1 spread prompt renew private sector investment dollar, gain strength consequence. the appreciation dollar come halt last november. however, thing stand, exchange rate major currency conducive adjustment external imbalances. high rate growth far make possible postpone adjustment, condition cannot last indefinitely. in 2005 various condition arise could help initiate process adjustment. domestic demand accelerate japan, less extent europe well. the reform china’s foreign exchange system, although produce small appreciation renminbi far, step right direction; cool u property market, signs, might slow growth private consumption. an adjustment underlie real imbalance best guarantee orderly progress. for happen, current trend need support combination restrictive fiscal policy unite states, great exchange rate flexibility asian economies, structural reform europe. 2. international financial condition on international financial market real interest rate volatility financial asset low. relax stable financial condition foster economic growth, turn conducive conditions. at time may reflect reduce perception risk market participant encourage build illiquid highly risky positions. the low level long-term interest rate mainly result continue expectation moderate inflation, even considerable time span. these expectation base credibility monetary policies. investor accept modest return part perception diminish risk, relate limit volatility security price condition real economy. the expansionary cycle wage moderation sustain growth corporate profits, thereby improve state firms’ finances. the insolvency rate well long-run average. the spread corporate public-sector bond unprecedentedly narrow. other contributory factor keep interest rate investment current account surplus asian economy oilexporting country increase investment pension funds. these flow prove unresponsive tighten monetary policy federal reserve ecb; effect limit short term maturities. the yield curve flattened, particularly unite states. in view historically low level interest rate risk-free assets, surge demand risky security investor search high returns. in context, reduction risk premium long reflect diminution underlie risks, also agents’ reduce risk aversion. nor rule premium ask hedge risk underestimate true magnitude. the favourable condition financial market delay correction real imbalances, mask symptom without remove causes. the international market become robust, contribute orderly reallocation financial flows. the condition right take place gradually, context balance strong global growth. however, geopolitical events, sharp internal international tension oil-producing country shock due individual corporate event link single sector production, could trigger brusque change agents’ attitude sudden reallocation save investments, lead wide swing price real financial asset exchange rates. this possibility small today entirely absent. the widespread use derivative instrument may offer good mean risk management, could also accelerate propagation extreme events. 3. integrated, efficient robust market efficient well-regulated markets, apart perform normal function allocate financial resource best way possible, crucial ensure system robust enough withstand violent shocks, however unlikely. 2 bi review 15/2006 policy design speed integration europe’s financial market infrastructure contribute orderly last economic growth. market integration allow firm exploit economy scale reduce cost access; increase opportunity diversify investments; ensure efficient allocation resources; improve ability absorb shocks; strengthen stability system. in europe, market integration further single currency stability-oriented monetary policy. it go far enough yet. additional measure need harmonize law regulation adapt infrastructure. the great progress make money market, thank among thing development target settlement system. in november 2007 supersede target 2, bring benefit firm term liquidity management. a know, bank italy key figure project, alongside french german central banks, intend maintain role. in case government securities, common platform mt

consolidation federation national market would achieve benefits. unrestricted equal access settlement system multiple link various market would foster competition efficiency. italy’s stock exchange face challenge adapt new context. our primary goal ensure ease access european market infrastructure firm intermediaries. we need reflect together best way achieve this. the integration security clear settlement system yet reach satisfactory level owe difference national infrastructure predate launch monetary union. the existence numerous national systems, non-standard services, diverse market practice different law tax rules, increase risk cost settle cross-border transactions. some specific barrier integrate post-trading system clearly identified. the removal create difference law

base distinction safeguard stability intermediary one hand protect investor supervise market other. this distinction, essential effective action clear attribution responsibilities, require cooperation

macroeconomic stability - historical perspective speech mr svein gjedrem, governor norge bank (central bank norway), norwegian embassy, new dehli, 21 march 2006. the chart pdf-format find norge bank’s website. the speech contain assessment economic situation monetary stance. please note text may differ slightly actual presentation. * * * excellencies, lady gentlemen, it great honour address today behalf norge bank. the tie norway india seem grow stronger, spite geographical distance vast difference two countries. over last years, number norwegian company enter indian market strengthen involvement india. for example, norwegian oil gas company norsk hydro report almost 300 000 hour engineer service natural gas field ormen lange supply indian engineers, locate india. last year, government pension fund make first investment indian stock market. by end 2005, fund hold 70 indian companies. there also numerous cultural ties. this year, norway commemorate famous playwright henrik ibsen. a wide range event arrange norway abroad. of particular interest indian actor provide fresh interpretation ibsen’s work, india norway. the topic speech today norwegian experience balance economic development macroeconomic stability historical perspective. a background subject, let start brief characteristic norway today economic perspective. first, norway small, mountainous country population 4½ million people scatter across land area one tenth size india. second, norway’s economic growth favourable many years, per caput income among high world. an abundance natural resources, least oil gas, openness trade capital movement important reason this. the petroleum sector’s share gdp approximately 24 per cent 2005. over last 10 years, government earn high petroleum revenue spent. today sizeable government pension fund, invest fund globally. globalisation cyclical development kind norwegian economy. price import good fall relation price good export. norway’s term trade improving. the impact rise oil gas price particularly strong, terms-of-trade gain mainland economy also high. one aspect trade service india increasing. petroleum luck is, however, whole story behind high per caput income norway. we also successful seize opportunity offer change international environments. the foundation norwegian welfare state establish two hundred year back history. long-term economic development the napoleonic wars, torment europe early 19th century, bring great change face europe. norway take opportunity adopt constitution establish number central governmental institutions, include central bank. norway severely hit economic crisis follow war, around 1820 norway’s gdp per caput low many comparable countries. in second half 1820s, new period economic expansion started. the upturn gather momentum middle century. an event considerable impact norwegian ship economic history take place 1849 england repeal navigation act regulate right transport good england colonies. bi review 22/2006 1 this new competition-friendly trade environment spur rapid build-up norwegian commercial fleet. norway suddenly become major exporter services. a chart shows, tonnage norwegian commercial fleet increase almost six-fold 1850 1880. by 1880, norway build world’s third large commercial fleet. in latter part 1800s, norway benefit greatly free trade free capital movement become relatively prosperous country. access international technology, competence capital important first industrial base establish late 19th century. the bank sector also expand rapidly period. a chart shows, value add manufacture service become important increase share total gdp. employment value add agriculture, fishery etc., hand, decline markedly. by begin 20th century, standard live norway lag behind european countries. this change industry structure necessary lie heart economic development. the second half 19th century also represent golden age norwegian cultural development, literature henrik ibsen, music edvard grieg late paint edvard munch. in period precede first world war, world experience period strong growth trade cross-border capital flows. there political barrier major technological advance foster growth trade. prosperity increased. but period interrupted, interwar period protectionism gain ground, trade barrier contraction international trade. this combine deep economic recessions. economic policy second world war after second world war, strong belief evolve norway economy could control steer desire direction. the support market economy lose grind recession financial instability interwar period. economic policy mark coordination, control regulation. at time, norway take part international organisations. international organisation make effort promote economic cooperation increase integration international trade fix investment. trade barrier gradually scale back trade pick already 1950s. capital movement remain strongly regulated, however. maintenance high level fix capital formation inter alia infrastructure private public industrial company important part economic policy war. the fix investment-to-gdp ratio stay historically high level late 1970s. on hand, low negative real interest rates, combine credit regulation, contribute low return capital inefficient use resources. since late 1970s, investment ratio decline norway many european countries. india, hand, process catch up. high investment growth infrastructure well business probably important maintain high economic growth india. the government sector norway increase importance begin 1990s. tax raise support increase use resource public service sector support rise level transfer household industries. the regulatory economic policy post-war period was, however, sustainable. this policy root many problem follow 1970s 1980s. today’s formulation economic policy reflect experience gain lesson learn two decades. the economic policy contribute wide fluctuation norwegian economy. inflation become high variable. this largely due perception 1960s 1970s strong growth low unemployment could achieve will accept somewhat high inflation. but gradually recognise trade-off. the absence nominal anchor one main reason behind pronounce swing norwegian economy. with policy low interest rate devaluations, inflation take root. nominal interest rate keep low level even though inflation rose. frequent devaluation 1976 unable long term prevent decline manufacture sector. on contrary, prove self-reinforcing. the wide fluctuation culminate credit boom mid-1980s. the fluctuation reinforce oil price shock use expect revenue oil production. the government begin already 1970s budget basis future strong growth 2 bi review 22/2006 petroleum revenues. the result spend large share petroleum wealth 1970s 1980s. welfare scheme expand significantly. manufacture industry scale back. the recession credit bubble burst oil price fell 1986 deep. the recession deep would case maintain large competitive manufacture sector. norwegian industry lose export market share late 1980s spite boom condition abroad substantial capacity slack home. it recognise substantial revision economic policy would necessary problem create inflation take seriously. the exchange rate choose nominal anchor 1986. a fix exchange rate intermediate target achieve low stable inflation. inflation fell gradually 2-3 per cent 1991-1992. we abandon fix exchange rate policy 1992. an important reason weakness inherent fix exchange rate regime world free capital flow deep financial markets. the krone exchange rate showed, however, little change begin rapidly find new range. a formal inflation target monetary policy introduce spring 2001. the operational target monetary policy define government inflation close 2.5 per cent time. many country already gain many years’ experience operate system. new zealand first line towards end 1980s. canada follow shortly thereafter. development past 40 year illustrate important contribution monetary policy make sound economic development long term low stable inflation. this provide economy nominal anchor. low stable inflation make easy economic agent distinguish change relative price change general price level. price become accurate information vehicle. through 1990s, inflation generally remain interval 1½ – 3½ per cent. when confidence inflation target, monetary policy also contribute stabilise output employment. norge bank operate flexible inflation target regime, weight give variability inflation variability output employment interest-rate setting. in order make forecast inflation output, must also judge interest rate develop future. if inflation deviate substantially target period, interest rate set view return gradually target, avoid substantial variation output employment. this chart illustrate judgement publish late inflation report. past experience indicate expectation future inflation remain stable even inflation vary somewhat long interest rate use actively curb effects. monetary policy cannot fine-tune economic developments, prevent large effect occur economy expose disturbances. in situations, may appropriate take account particularly unfavourable developments. in period increase cross-border labour flows, substantial technological advances, change competitive condition new trade patterns, norway may, open economy, accept somewhat great variation inflation deviation target, witness past two three years. challenge oil economy petroleum revenue pose mention special challenge stabilisation policy. the experience country receive large, unexpected income natural resource encouraging. the classic example spain’s substantial revenue colonisation america 1600s. the historian david landes1 summarise spanish experience follows: land state easy money bad country. it tempt live comfortably income le concern safeguard revenue sources. in case, country poorly poise cope end easy money. 1 david land (1998): the wealth poverty nations, w.w. norton & company, inc., n.y. bi review 22/2006 3 the oil age norway span 30 year appear continue many year ahead. petroleum activity give norway economic base available many countries. but also present u many challenges. first, petroleum wealth part norway’s national wealth. it mislead look upon cash flow petroleum activity income. the appropriate economic perspective see transfer cash flow government pension fund way transfer capital one account another – petroleum foreign securities. by so, diversify risk. we must also strive equitable distribution wealth across generations. the norwegian authority successful ensure bulk petroleum wealth benefit society whole. both state’s ownership interest state’s direct financial interest petroleum activity (sdfi) tax system contributed. the company extract oil earn reasonable return investment incentive invest, economic rent essentially accrue general public. second, size cash flow petroleum activity also varies. if petroleum revenue use accrue, would lead wide fluctuation demand norwegian economy. third, use petroleum revenue impact competitiveness norwegian business industry. a high level substantial variation use petroleum revenue would negative impact internationally expose industries. the establishment government pension fund spend guideline petroleum revenue intend meet challenges. the government earn large net cash flow derive oil companies’ sale petroleum product foreign markets. the pension fund serf buff current petroleum revenue spend revenue norwegian economy. all central government revenue petroleum operation shall transfer fund. accord fiscal rule approve norwegian parliament, petroleum revenue spend shall limit 4 per cent expect annual real return pension fund time. this partly insulate economy fluctuation oil price extraction rate petroleum sector – follow ensure revenue spend norwegian economy level sustain time. the difference net cash flow spend reinvested foreign financial markets. the petroleum fund also function buff dampen wide fluctuation krone exchange rate petroleum revenue might otherwise generated. operator foreign exchange market may time tendency underestimate fund’s function stabilisation mechanism. the capital outflow fund contribute curb appreciation krone maintain stability. at end 2005, market value pension fund’s portfolio roughly 73 per cent gdp. a show chart, value fund rise rapidly may continue year ahead. the fund approach nominal value one year’s gdp may reach two course next decade. on hand, norway, like many countries, face substantial fiscal challenges. finance large pension payment disburse come year demanding. final remark to sum up, norway market economy large government sector. the way economic policy orient today reflect knowledge gain lesson learned. we know experience fiscal policy alone cannot ensure high level employment. the structure labour market wage formation probably great importance. the direct regulation credit, interest rate capital movement collapse phase 1980s. price regulation long play role macroeconomic instrument. the scope business policy become general. 4 bi review 22/2006 the important contribution monetary policy make sound economic development long term low stable inflation. low stable inflation contribute solid growth global economy recent years. thank attention. bi review 22/2006 5 ivan iskrov: financial progress prospect speech mr ivan iskrov, governor bulgarian national bank, sixth business roundtable government bulgaria, sofia, 21 march 2006. * * * dear minister oresharski, lady gentlemen, it pleasure participate together minister finance panel event dedicate financial development prospect country’s economy. base statutory division labour central bank governor finance minister one hand, central bank government other, speech i deal mainly issue relate country’s external position, development bank lend inflation, impact variable bnb’s policy. i would like immediately underscore issue cannot discussed, outside context economic growth prospects, accession country eu, trend development world economy. for good understand bulgarian economy recent years, several global trend influence significantly development economy highlighted. firstly, dominance principle free trade liberalization capital movement, combine investors’ increase propensity hold asset issue third country residents, bring on-going growth international trade exchange capital. in environment, domestic demand long restrict within amount current national income, current account deficit always indicator fundamental imbalances. a emphasize increase number scientists, central bankers, finance ministers, imbalanced external account individual country become rather rule exception (a. greenspan, m. king). in addition, empirical research, well european institution (european central bank, european commission) point process convergence inevitably accompany current account deficits. secondly, decrease long-term interest rate develop economies, accompany reduction risk premium develop economies, result investors’ pursuit high yield develop markets. there multiple factor determine developments, i would focus today. what underscore global trend channel significant amount capital flow develop economies. irrespective monetary policy regime (fixed float exchange rate), absorption large capital inflow inevitably put monetary authority trial. to illustrate large scale process, i give bulgaria example, capital inflow (in form direct investment debt) 1.5% gdp 1998, recent two year approximate 15% gdp. thirdly, significant long-lasting growth since 2003 price oil energy resource considerably contribute international imbalances, particularly bulgaria’s current account deficit. this process account considerable growth expenditure import energy resource incur importer countries, enormous cash flow channel export countries. for bulgaria, development energy resource price result increase cost import product eur 1.7 billion 2002 (the year process sustainable oil price increase started) almost eur 3.0 billion 2005. this trend strongly manifest past year, country’s expenditure energy resource import grow 52% 2004. these three global trends, combination approach full-fledged eu membership country, produce unique environment bulgarian economy never faced. this make analysis process economic policy decisionmaking complex difficult. a i already noted, recent several years, enormous volume capital channel country, bank system act natural intermediary effective distribution resources. this surprise all, give successfully implement privatization bank sector bulgaria. at present, 80% bulgarian bank sector own foreign investors, majority euro area countries. a consequence strong competition bi review 22/2006 1 good investment prospects, growth rate lend private sector accelerate level 48.6% year end- 2004. the ratio bank credit gdp increase 12.1% 1999 45.0% end 2005. of course, dynamic reflect great extent process convergence country’s economy, particular degree financial intermediation, level evidence eu member state (112% gdp). at time, central bank cannot help ask question extent quick growth bank credit may result potential risk financial macroeconomic stability country. the bnb determine moment, convergence grow self-propelled process struggle market share. such transition entail considerable risks, lead sustainable growth rate financial intermediation economic activity employment. therefore, since begin 2004, bnb start process phase measure (primarily prudential administrative) aim slow bank credit growth sustainable level, would put risk stability economy. data indicate central bank’s policy result change commercial banks’ behaviour reduce growth bank lend 32.4% end 2005. in current year, sustain effect already implement measures, expect bank credit grow rate near 20%. a i mention earlier, dynamic bank intermediation country cannot contemplate isolation process free movement capital accompany dynamic balance payment current account. intuitively, many economist tend seek direct cause effect relation bank credit growth current account dynamics. they rely logic growth bank intermediation increase possibility consumption investment, combine existence free trade slow response domestic supply lead accumulation external imbalances. such reason great extent rational, lead, clearly manifest bnb’s policy, define simple rule balance payment dynamic directly control control bank credit rate growth. this clarification allow turn next issue i would like discuss, namely dynamic country’s external position. the stable macroeconomic environment bulgaria, plus sustainably high rate economic growth prospect membership eu bring increase amount investments. their share gdp first three quarter 2005 increase 26.6%, mark high level reach since begin economic reform country. the growth investment concomitant improvement employment, increase current income households, expect future incomes, associate increase consumption decrease save economy. a consequence processes, gap balance payment current account widen level 5% gdp 2003 2004, expand 11.9% end-2005. from perspective current account immediate dynamics, economy face question current level deficit surplus determine structural factors, i.e. close balance level, maintain within medium-term, consequence unsustainable trend one-off factors. both group factor play important role development current account deficit 2005. first all, above-mentioned growth investment accompany considerable import investment goods. in 2005, import group good grow 31.2%, share total structure import reach 28%. this trend associate slow-down growth import non-energy raw material consumer goods. in current year, expect rate import investment good remain high, give rapid pace technological innovation economy, mainly account forthcoming eu membership country. multiple one-off factor significant effect past year, include abrupt increase price volume oil imports, sweep floods, trouble export third quarter year. this year, current account deficit expect drop 11 % gdp, mainly due slow growth imports, recovery export growth, evidence since last quarter previous year begin 2006. in january, export good increase 27.5% annual basis, exports, exclude energy goods, increase 17%. the continue implementation reform labour market education, improvement business environment, include significant improvement operation judiciary, key importance maintain competitive advantage ensure sustainability country’s external position, well preserve interrelation salary growth productivity labour. a well aware, revenue tourist service influence considerably country’s balance payment (15% country’s export good service 2 bi review 22/2006 2005), necessitate fast elimination exist obstacle development industry. before i conclude presentation, i would like focus inflation dynamics. at first sight, variable seem great challenge us, compare issue discuss above. look prospect mind country’s strategy expeditious accession euro area, however, macroeconomic variable face country great challenges. the inflation criterion, define maastricht treaty (this place deal issue good definition is), strict require purposeful policy go beyond monetary fiscal policies. in bulgaria’s case, currency regime fix exchange rate extremely conservative fiscal policy, untapped prospect seek encourage competition improve business climate, thus ensure economy flexibility respond exogenous change (including regard price raw materials) enable supply react promptly increase demand (both domestic external). in past year, inflation reach 6.5 % strong proinflationary impact increase price energy resource (direct contribution 1.0 % overall price increase).in addition, largescale flood result unexpected increase foodstuff price (contribution 2.6 % overall price increase). this year, inflation expect decline 6.0%. the slow process decrease inflation mainly determine harmonization indirect tax minimum level eu, pursue early year. a change indirect tax administer price direct effect domestic inflation, catching-up adjustment effect year use basis evaluation compliance maastricht criterion – i.e. 2008. from perspective, early time harmonization excise tax step facilitate significantly performance inflation criterion, would eliminate proinflationary impact increase tax year evaluation made. in conclusion, i would like sum that, light rapid change structure economy, stable macroeconomic policy pursue government bnb, prospect eu membership, concerns, express leaflet conference, possible overheat economy risk entail stability, seem rather exaggerated. the country’s external imbalance finance capital inflow signal stability, credibility potential development economy. of course, economic policy maker may complaisant. the challenge bulgarian economy face well recognized, take necessary measure preserve stability growth economy. lady gentlemen, thank attention. bi review 22/2006 3 adrian orr: towards framework promote financial stability new zealand speech mr adrian orr, deputy governor reserve bank new zealand, present institution professional engineer new zealand, wellington, 22 march 2006. this speech draw article hunter, orr white forthcoming reserve bank bulletin march 2006. * * * thank opportunity participate conference new zealand infrastructure. the topic i assign "what infrastructure need develop order keep new zealand growing?" when people refer infrastructure, probably mind physical infrastructure, like transport, energy, water communication networks. those critical grow economy, certainly new zealand attract fair amount attention. however, i focus aspect economic infrastructure core reserve bank's role, is, new zealand's financial infrastructure. the financial system i argue least critical future growth new zealand economy physical infrastructure, though probably take granted. in speech i outline begin framework assess promotion financial stability, outline reserve bank new zealand see important role. i also highlight area bank work promote financial stability. the critical role financial system the financial system infrastructure perhaps traditional sense word (e.g. wires, brick mortar, electricity, communication devices). the system also make legal structures, agree behaviour practices, information knowledge. of course, power go phone go down, financial system struggle operate. we think system comprise three interconnect components: financial markets, institutions, payment systems. financial market financial contract enter trade directly buyer seller (or borrower lenders). financial institution intermediate borrower lender (including central bank) provide financial services. while payment system allow financial transaction within market institution made. these component financial system act together enable vast majority economic exchange, play pivotal role allocation economic financial resources. in market do `price mechanism': buyer highly value particular resource bid high price, certain condition market set price efficiently allocate resource value (at least measure ability pay). in practice, financial institution allocate resource depend level risk institution wish expose to. achieve efficiency allocate resource mostly ensure condition require optimal economic exchange satisfied. these condition include existence market allocate form financial risk, clear ownership right financial risk reward, investor adequate information make financial decisions. the efficiency bi review 22/2006 1 financial system mostly satisfy condition require competition, example, low barrier entry absence monopoly powers. it important note time system price allocate resource, price allocate risk. the price risk additional yield (or premium) investor would expect receive hold risky asset `risk-free' interest rate. hence, market, investor best manage risk associate asset prepare receive low risk premium compensation risk exposure (or conversely pay high asset price). efficient price risk therefore tend result risk allocate best understand nature risk, will well-positioned manage it. in sense, efficient financial system also stable one. when financial system stable? it may come surprise many audience, last decade recognise internationally amongst financially unstable modern history.1 many region period experience period financial instability. this include new zealand, australia, scandinavia, late 1980s early 1990s, japan throughout much 1990s, east asia 1997/98, unite states, first early 1990s (the save loan crisis) early decade (the ‘tech wreck’). these experience result financial stability issue come fore central banks' attention. many central banks, include reserve bank new zealand, publish regular financial stability report alongside regular monetary policy inflation reports. however, framework undertake surveillance link financial system surveillance policy power purpose le develop central banks' monetary policy function. unlike inflation targeting, financial stability easily quantify concept, also clearly separable factor political stability, international financial stability, wide economic social stability. in general terms, financial system stable resilience continue efficiently provide financial service plausible range adverse circumstances. a plausible range financial loss also able absorb without financial system disruption. by contrast, financial system consider impair material number user incur significant loss exposure financial system risk could expect aware of, manage.2 we thus define precondition financial stability exist financial system risk adequately identified, allocated, price managed. all four precondition may strictly necessary relevant every instance. in case precondition could adequately meet non-price approach risk management. or one might argue perfect market full information, adequately ‘priced’ risk would also imply adequately identified, allocate manage risk (in case adequate price alone would relevant precondition). for generality, market fail various reasons, see adequate combination identification, pricing, allocation management financial system risk necessary financial stability. this definition financial stability term precondition rather outcomes, hence like definition price stability reserve bank's policy target agreement. our definition financial stability also ex ante (rather ex post) definition. it value thus lie prompt question policymakers financial system user relation whether apparent imbalance misalignment may source financial instability. however, even precondition financial stability place, volatility sharp adjustment financial price (and/or quantities) still occur. these often important part adjustment 1 see aliber (2005) "the 35 tumultuous year monetary history: shocks, transfer problem, financial trauma" imf staff papers, vol 52. special issue 2 from draghi, giavazzi, merton (2006): "to understand breed condition financial crisis prime source concern risk per se, unintended, unanticipated accumulation risks..." 2 bi review 22/2006 process sound stable system. short-term price volatility often cause ‘price discovery’ ‘quantity adjustment’ process occur economic circumstance change. such volatility is, however, le likely lead financial instability necessitate form crisis intervention precondition financial stability place. furthermore, financial crisis still occur. financial crisis cause combination unlikely event correlation obvious ex ante. hence financial crisis management capability necessary. financial system risks, instability market failure financial system risk exist component financial system. if one component (markets, institutions, payment systems) financial system impaired, become unstable operate allocate resource efficiently. the main type financial system risk categorise credit, market, liquidity, operational risks. credit risk relate risk contract represent payable fix sum money future pay full maturity. market risk relate potential market value asset fluctuate of, example, change credit risk assessment, change assessment future income flow asset, change rate exchange currencies. liquidity risk risk loss might incur result force sale. operational risk relate risk economic loss cause process breakdown, example, computer failure, human error, fraud. financial instability trigger variety cause shocks. these cause generally arise combination structural behavioural factors. structural market failure attributable factor information asymmetries, externalities, moral hazard. behavioural market failure refer issue herd behaviour investment decisions, investment fad fashions, myopia decision make around various component financial system. there substantial overlap structural/behavioural categories; example structural problem information asymmetry likely contribute herd behaviour, cause agent rely observation other's trade information regard appropriate market price. structural failure an important determinant structural failure financial system information asymmetry. seller (or borrowers) typically know risk embody exchange buyer (lenders). face asymmetry, buyer cautious, tend over-estimate (price) risk. if risk over-priced, may drive less-risky activities, cause buyer (lenders) become cautious still. such process result le exchange would otherwise case two side exchange equally informed. hence, important purpose financial regulation address information gap. the regulation may include insist great level disclosure, impose certain standard seller (borrowers). financial regulation, like many form regulation, thus generally entail combination disclosure requirement standard setting. the existence externality ‘free-rider’ opportunity instance also mean risk may bear owner asset, hence price manage adequately. a result under-investment risk management task may occur, as, example, ensure ongoing operational capacity critical payment system systemically important financial institution. structural factor mean identifying, pricing, allocating, manage financial risk difficult times, impossible, thus necessitate various form prudential regulation, financial crisis management capabilities, and/or public provision certain financial services. for example, difficult able identify threat financial stability ex ante. hence, form risk best manage ensure adequate capital buff place absorb loss without bi review 22/2006 3 disruption system. the basel ii process allocate capital buff various form financial risk bank example intervention. some form risk also adequately price due lack market price discovery process occur. likewise, free-rider externality aspect certain payment system network may mean risk allocate accordingly may mismanaged. this may necessitate public provision certain service (e.g. utility networks) prepositioned loss allocation mechanism case bank failure. behavioural stress the financial system also expose destabilise

difficult. the extent central bank attempt assessment also area considerable debate. much debate concern rather polar positions, is, whether central bank ‘target’ asset prices. the financial stability assessment framework outline speech approach question "either-or" issue, instead aim assist assessment-based approach provide framework questions. furthermore, craft regulatory infrastructure support process economic exchange far straightforward. for example, regulation excessively constrain sellers, whether directly imposition compliance costs, cause withdraw market lead economic inefficiencies. significant ‘moral hazard’ problem also arise, over-regulation remove actual financial risk owner asset, institution, market, payment system. the public provision certain financial service may also crowd competition innovation. it also important recognise market generate solution otherwise would information asymmetry market failures. financial intermediary market response underlie economic problem. the role bank monitor manage risk embed risky loan depositor would unable monitor themselves. bank effect facilitate economic exchange depositor borrower play role balance information asymmetry. however, always question: monitor monitors? in financial system, number mechanism perform role: shareholders, appoint (boards director auditors), creditors, rat agencies, regulators. experience suggest market-based solution - sometimes regulatory prompt encouragement - often result good perform financial system over-relying regulatory interventions. the reserve bank thus balance self market discipline practice requirements, additional regulatory requirements. we acutely aware importance get balance right, risk over-regulation. the general principle aspire prudential regulation role thus include: • keep efficiency issue centre attention; • utilise synergy amongst monetary policy, macro prudential, supervision market operation roles; • maintain system overview well know individual institution well; • seek utilise market force far possible rather oppose them; • recognise many common interest supervise institutions; • use incentive-based technique much possible; • make sure maintain high analytical standard regulatory design. in summary, approach financial system regulation stand point role enable economic activity - support process people firm engage welfare improve specialisation trade. to regulate enable might seem something contradiction. however, system work need rules, referees, general confidence. user system need basis confident financial contracts, institutions, markets, payment networks. absent basis confidence, scope welfare enhance economic financial exchange diminished. the reserve bank's activity promote financial stability the

new–keynesian approach, form current paradigm monetary economics, large doubt relevance money monetary policy make environment central bank predominantly use short-term interest rate achieve goals. in addition, though theoretical le radical point view, market participant often criticise contribution monetary analysis decision-making process govern council obvious be. i argue follow remark criticism unjustified view challenge task conduct monetary policy real time uncertain environment. first all, general consensus “inflation monetary phenomenon” – milton friedman put it; central bank aim price stability therefore simply cannot afford completely discard monetary indicators; i learn recent deliberation central bank traditionally critical attitude towards use monetary indicator – e.g. bank england – confirm assessment. however, exactly monetary analysis implement use monetary policy decision depend crucially empirical relationship monetary aggregates, inflation macroeconomic variable interest. the question put simple terms: how monetarist one be? and simple agnostic answer is: monetarist empirical evidence supports. there well-established long-run relationship money growth inflation euro area: monetary aggregate euro area prove explanatory power longer-term inflationary developments. this documented, least, current research carry bundesbank. a long relationship hold, convince empirical reason pay close attention monetary development policy make process. beyond issue, conceptual reason money matter: it offer suitable long term perspective internal decision-making external communication, thus enhance credibility. of course, latter point general importance central bank especially important eurosystem monetary policy begin third stage emu. in 1999 eurosystem posse establish track record. thus, strategy make use empirically establish long-term relationship money growth inflation especially important gain secure credibility right outset emu. bi review 21/2006 1 and irrespective question whether active role money play transmission mechanism, i.e. whether money exogenous endogenous. this bring back academic criticism stem new-keynesian school thought. despite undoubted merit approach – sound theoretical principles, microfoundations, general equilibrium character – also shortcomings. firstly, transmission mechanism specify leanly mechanistically. for example, one prominent channel role money class model real-balance effect – something empirically difficult verify arguably simplistic present-day world financial markets. some year ago, controversy monetarist keynesian allan meltzer argue that: “the difference keynesian u le nature process range asset considered“. apply current environment, word lose much relevance. furthermore, new-keynesian approach natural extension real business cycle framework world nominal rigidities. a such, focus short-term deviation relevant variable trend. the empirical evidence correlation money inflation, however, low-frequency nature. in words, relevant trend behaviour inflation. in nutshell, give empirical evidence, seem new-keynesian framework miss something important working-mechanisms economy inflation generate process govern it. something is– least - empirically capture information content monetary aggregates. moreover, merit analyse monetary development broad framework encompass credit dynamic allow extract valuable information regard possible financial market tension cause build-up asset price bubbles. in light consideration much question whether monetary policy eurosystem pay close attention monetary aggregates. the relevant issue best done, is, monetary aggregate feature monetary policy design. here, challenge task monetary analysis separate real time noise short-run development monetary aggregate part monetary dynamic signal risk future price stability. monetary analysis, properly understand implemented, mechanical forecast exercise. it take account possibility money demand shock inject noise liquidity-inflation nexus possible structural shift money demand relations. up-to-date monetary analysis broadly-based approach ongoing intellectual endeavour. and precisely monetary analysis develop past year eurosystem. in environment high financial uncertainty identify large liquidity shock lead significant portfolio shift liquid secure bank deposits. and derive toolbox liquidity measure signal possible excess liquidity. apply toolbox allow separate liquidity development root predominantly financial uncertainty development signal imminent inflation risks. for example actual strong increase money stock m3 accompany low level interest rate strong rise loan private sector. all all, elaborate analysis monetary aggregate well component counterpart useful tool monetary policymakers. it clearly potential enhance robustness judgment future economic developments. in past years, academic research emphasise advantage robust analytical tool appropriate policy response environment prevail uncertainty – something always know practitioner central banking. however, besides longer-term nature relationship monetary development inflation, need take account also short-term risk price stability. this core economic analysis strategy eurosystem. give different time horizon economic monetary analysis i think demand sometimes brought-up public debate merge two pillar convincing. there exist model would allow integrate multitude economic information relevant 2 bi review 21/2006 monetary policy one coherent theoretical structure. this especially relevant integration monetary aggregate traditional macroeconomic macroeconometric models. insofar, proposal merge two pillar ill-founded. the ultimate goal two-pillar structure efficient utilisation available information monetary policy decision communication. however, one possible approach regard information gain lens economic monetary analysis might find strong formalise combine assessment information include pillar future inflation developments. this sense cross-check about. of course, merit formalise forecast combination would weight possible loss information might associate it. this bring another criticism sometimes voiced, namely monetary development regard informative eurosystem’s monetary policy decisions. in view, criticism unjustified: firstly, nature information content monetary analysis take account role cross-check device focus longer-term risk price stability. secondly, environment heighten financial market uncertainty actual monetary dynamic may large part drive noise necessitate monetary policy reaction. the portfolio-shift adjustment money growth post 2001 period see example. by way: the role money policy decision analyse recent empirical research; issue find kind non-linear relationship monetary development policy reaction. such threshold effect view deserve empirical investigation. let conclude say experience first seven year emu shown: • monetary analysis play important role policy strategy policy decision • monetary analysis challenge evolve exercise give today’s financial market dynamic • that, even environment, money empirically justify informative role. bi review 21/2006 3 lars nyberg: the framework modern central bank speech mr lars nyberg, deputy governor sverige riksbank, conference reform state bank vietnam, hanoi, 21 march 2006. * * * thank invite conference reform state bank vietnam. i imagine one reason i invite central bank i represent, sverige riksbank sweden, decade ago situation resemble one state bank vietnam experience now. at time reach situation strong reason – imperative one – reconsider way use think monetary policy. it become clear reform monetary policy framework desirable necessary. of course, sweden mean country monetary policy undergo major change recent times. the view best conduct monetary policy change fairly radically past twenty year reflect le worldwide reform process. what i hope able contribute today – introduction discussion – provide overall picture idea form basis process describe today consider guide principle modern central bank, accord establish research practical experiences. what objective central bank have? the fundamental question ask one point reform monetary policy framework is, course, objective monetary policy be. on general level objective monetary policy say create environment economy develop best possible manner. however, definition general great practical use, although exclude task sometimes impose central banks. to obtain operational definition, necessary take discussion one step ask question monetary policy contribute favourable economic development. on fundamental plane, one could say central bank’s main task ensure payment system economy function efficiently. this mean simple term payment financial transaction make easily smoothly entail little risk possible. many scholar also regard main reason central bank originally founded1. an economy’s payment system regard sort infrastructure roughly way country’s communication network energy supply system. it also essentially fulfil purpose, i.e. ensure flow essential economy – case flow money – function properly. however, ensure payment system function efficiently also fairly general definition require precision. to become specific, necessary define characterise efficient payment system. i intend discus two characteristic i perceive central – price stability financial stability. price stability an important component efficient payment system economic agent confidence value mean payment remain stable time, practice inflation low stable. one usually express nominal anchor prevent inflation inflation expectation drift off. if household company confident general price level change much, good able plan future need put effort 1 see, instance, santomero, a.m., s. viotti a. vredin, (2001), "challenges central banking: an introduction”, santomero, a.m., s. viotti a. vredin (ed.), challenge central banking, kluwer academic publishers. bi review 21/2006 1 find way protect inflation, focus productive activities. another argument keep inflation low focus role price formation signal system. when inflation low stable easy economic agent distinguish change relative price adjust decision regard consumption, saving, work investment accordingly. high fluctuate inflation, hand, disrupt signal function price system easily lead bad economic decisions. in environment low inflation, price system good job allocate resource us good. in broad sense, one could see efficient price system part efficient payment system – ensure transaction make base best information possible. price stability also justify reason immediately connect efficiency payment system, fact high fluctuate inflation tend give rise undesirable distribution effects. for instance, inflation appear hit poor people hard rich usually good opportunity protect themselves, even benefit, effect inflation2. this could because, instance, poor people often opportunity retain large part limit asset form money great extent rich dependent public subsidy fully indexed. keep inflation low stable currently obvious – definitely notice – task modern central banks. the reason focus price stability course negative experience high fluctuate inflation many country experience 1970s 1980s. during period one could say central banks’ original task guarantee value mean payment neglect tasks, primarily affect demand economy, perceive important interest monetary policy. the consequence nominal anchor relinquish establish prove require considerable effort. let i discus important component efficient payment system – financial stability – say something common approach attain price stability. there currently two predominant mean try ensure inflation remain low stable level. one tie one’s currency currency country long tradition low stable inflation. the fix exchange rate thus become intermediate target one hope attain ultimate target – price stability. the mean allow exchange rate float give central bank task act directly attain low, stable inflation – know inflation targeting. the changeover monetary policy make sweden begin 1990s mean switch first method, fix exchange rate, second, target inflation. the reason quite simply fix exchange rate function well mean keep inflation establish nominal anchor economy. for couple decade fail keep price wage increase check. however, fix exchange rate relationship not, course, compatible inflation rate systematically exceed country exchange rate tie – sooner late exchange rate relationship must collapse. the rapid increase wage price also repeatedly come collision fix exchange rate result swedish currency devaluate several occasion mid-1970s onwards. the economy thus characterise "boom-bust-cycles” alternate strong acceleration sudden braking. however, fact fix exchange rate work nominal anchor sweden mean could function well countries; unquestionably do many cases. so let therefore move mention general advantage disadvantage two methods3. 2 see easterly, w. s. fischer, (2001), “inflation poor”, journal money, credit, bank 33, 2 (part 1), 160-178. for detail account advantage low, stable inflation, see instance king, m., (2002), ”the inflation target ten year on”, speech london school economics, november 19. 3 a detail discussion advantage disadvantage monetary policy regime find in, instance, mishkin, f.s., (1999), ”international experience different monetary policy regimes”, journal monetary economics 43, 579-605. 2 bi review 21/2006 perhaps foremost advantage fix exchange rate regime mean keep inflation control make task monetary policy simple straightforward: shall set key rate way enable exchange rate relationship maintained. this task also easy general public understand. at time, may disadvantage monetary policy tie single task. it cannot use subdue domestic disruption equivalent country currency tie – anchor country. at time, disruption anchor country immediately affect target country interest rate adjustment anchor country lead correspond interest rate adjustment target country. if, instance, interest rate anchor country raise demand country increasing, interest rate target country must also increase order maintain exchange rate relationship, even country recession. a fix exchange rate regime thus mean possible conduct independent monetary policy. the task keep economy balance steer inflation directly cannot thus rest central bank. a fix exchange rate relationship also expose speculative attack entirely credible. this case swedish krona several european currency begin 1990s. with regard inflation targeting, i course somewhat bias obvious reason find easy point advantage disadvantages. one advantage central bank conduct inflation target tie maintain particular exchange rate relationship, directly aim focus happen domestic economy. another, partly relate advantage – i believe important sweden’s case – inflation target mean one specific authority give clear responsibility maintain price stability. during 1970s 1980s entirely clear responsibility lay sweden. one could say responsibility practice delegate social partners, total economic policy tend time expansionary become difficult maintain wage price increase reasonable levels. a advantage inflation target task monetary policy, way fix exchange rate regime, easy general public understand. if i try find disadvantage inflation targeting, could difficult purely operational point view central bank steer inflation towards particular level maintain particular exchange rate relationship. inflation target thus much demand fix exchange rate regime regard central bank’s analytical work ability communicate policy. whether something regard disadvantage course question judgement. for riksbank, transition inflation target herald start fairly comprehensive increase competence field economics. the number phd economist riksbank rise sharply recent year research area relate monetary policy expand considerably. financial stability let move central component efficient payment system. this concern stability financial system; particularly financial institution supply payment services, i.e. primarily banks. financial stability currently regarded, parallel price stability target, main task modern central bank. the financial system essentially three main tasks: convert save financing, manage risk provide efficient channel payment. let give basic example. a bank receive save household lend household company need invest. bank specialist valuing, monitor manage credit risk household company lend. the bank therefore contribute ensure mediation capital economy function efficiently; sufficient borrower convince bank creditworthiness, need convince individual saver. similarly, saver ass creditworthiness every borrower; enough satisfy bank's solvency. the bank also supply payment service household company use exist financial infrastructure, account various routine transfer fund financial institutions. a function central efficient economy, evident major problem arise financial stability upset. this aptly illustrate by, instance, crisis south east asia bi review 21/2006 3 end 1990s bank crisis sweden country suffer begin decade. while target maintain price stability relatively straightforward intuitive, difficult specify task promote financial stability. this task also formulate slightly different way different central banks’ regulations. for instance, bank england’s charter say ”responsible overall stability financial system whole”, correspond task regulation sweden’s riksbank express indirect manner: ”to promote efficiency safety payment system”4. one strategy maintain financial stability briefly describe consist three different parts: clear regulatory framework, efficient day-to-day prudential supervision oversight preparedness act strongly quickly crisis. exactly role play central bank strategy also something vary country country. many central bank contribute different way formulation regulatory framework financial system, instance, give view propose bill participate committee domestic international legislation formulated. with regard day-to-day prudential supervision oversight, one solution apply sweden country supervision financial sector delegate special, independent authority power apply sanctions. in country supervision work do central bank itself. in case supervision delegate independent authority, central bank usually oversight role entail regularly monitor analyse development financial sector present view risk financial system. ever since bank crisis begin 1990s, perceive important task sweden; fact, could argue bank crisis allow arise partly authority previously specific task monitor overall financial stability. the riksbank publish twice-yearly report analyse stability swedish financial system. in crisis situation, central bank play important role. it may need go act lender last resort, is, grant emergency liquidity assistance (ela) bank financial company consider necessary prevent financial system collapsing. the two objective price stability financial stability relate different ways, addition important component efficient payment system. the stability financial system course necessary condition policy aim price stability, latter fairly meaningless country threaten economic collapse. the financial stability objective therefore one sense say superior objective price stability. at time, probable price stability long run promote financial stability, instance, make price system function good thereby reduce risk bad investments. however, price stability guarantee stability financial system, illustrated, instance, problem japanese bank begin 1990s. there thus reason central bank focus solely price stability objective thereby assume financial stability follow automatically – objective important. other objective price stability financial stability? be objective price stability financial stability may suitable modern central bank? many country also objective development real economy write regulatory framework govern central bank’s activities. for instance, u legislation say federal reserve shall promote “maximum employment”, british legislation say bank england shall support “the economic policy her majesty’s government, include objective growth employment”. in sweden specific objective real economic development write law, nevertheless consider understand 4 see, instance, oosterloo, s. j. de haan, (2003), ”a survey institutional framework financial stability”, occasional study vol.i/no. 4, de nederlandsche bank, overview task promote financial stability deal different central banks’ regulation practice. 4 bi review 21/2006 riksbank – authority riksdag, swedish parliament – shall support objective economic policy aim attain sustainable growth high level employment. exactly objective word thus vary considerably countries, often depend fact change modification gradually make regulation originally write much earlier. i dare claim nevertheless essence modern central banks’ word objective same. it question monetary policy, i say earlier, first foremost aim ensure credible nominal anchor economy. a long nominal anchor risk come loose, monetary policy aim stabilise real economy. i shall return shortly merely emphasise key word stabilise real economy nothing else. it may interest note context experience period low, stable inflation mean price stability increasingly perceive objective mean achieve macroeconomic objectives5. there many indication price stability beneficial effect efficiency growth economy. the reason i mentioned, i.e. price system function good signal mechanism low inflation environment household company spend time productive activity instead try protect inflation. essentially question price stability necessary condition efficient payment system, i say earlier. in addition, period low stable inflation also characterise many country le fluctuation growth real economy previously case. the difference compare development inflationist unstable 1970s, often entitle “the great inflation”, notable development award title academic research – “the great moderation”6. although reason great real economic stability entirely clear; hypothesis economy undergo various type structural change subdue fluctuation – improve stock management among company financial innovation – shock economy quite simply small 1970s. however, likely good monetary policy play role increase real economic stability. we thus establish central bank’s primary task be: maintain price stability, promote stability financial system – long nominal anchor form price stability target threaten – try stabilise real economy. there may nevertheless reason provide example appropriate objective central bank. a i try emphasise, real economic objective central bank entail stabilise real quantity production employment. by stabilise i mean one try reduce fluctuation around long-term trend. however, important realise long-term trend development something monetary policy directly influence. for example, country’s long-term growth determine development quantity labour real capital technological progress. the best monetary policy is, i already observed, indirectly contribute favourable economic development ensure inflation keep low stable financial stability good. although might tempting, therefore meaningless – often counter-productive even damage – give central bank task "creating" growth employment. if one try affect growth employment systematically keep interest rate low increase liquidity economy, allow public sector project finance directly central bank, profit short term. inflation rise way sooner late become difficult control – nominal anchor loosen – development real economy risk poor would otherwise. i believe correct claim lack insight excessive 5 see, instance, bernanke, b.s., (2006), ”the benefit price stability”, remark the center economic policy study occasion 75th anniversary woodrow wilson school public international affairs, princeton university, february 24. 6 see, instance, bernanke, b.s., (2004), “the great moderation”, remark meet eastern economic association, washington, dc, february 20. bi review 21/2006 5 optimism regard role monetary policy play long-term real economic growth one important reason inflation high 1970s. the value independence how one construct framework monetary policy provide central bank best possible condition carry tasks? here i intend fairly brief something discuss detail next contribution conference. let note currently general agreement central bank give opportunity work independent political system order attain objective price stability. it observe monetary policy conduct arm’s length party politics, great confidence price stability objective. this link fact often tendency politician use monetary policy short-term purpose conflict long-term price stability objective often entail loosen nominal anchor. make central bank independent probably element past decades’ monetary reform process trigger debate perceive controversial. it probably natural politician feel uncomfortable give central bank increase independence unavoidably mean give decision-making powers, moreover field perceive central. i assume one explanation why, instance, take sweden 1999 sufficient political support grant riksbank increase formal independence confirm law price stability objective, despite fact reform propose inflation target introduce 1993. however, concern among politician make central bank independent quite unwarranted. the independence not, course, mean central bank free conduct monetary policy wish; mean able use mean disposal meet objective set political system without outside intervention. this usually express central bank instrument independent goal independent. the delegation power regard mean politician ensure long-term aim monetary policy endeavour achieve – difficulty guarantee – become reality. furthermore, natural consequence independence central bank shall accountable action monetary policy shall conduct transparent manner7. it interest note that, despite fairly substantial initial doubts, people afterwards satisfy reform implemented. monetary policy therefore appear essentially deliver hop i aware country make central bank independent regretted. conclusion let round off. i begin say state bank vietnam currently situation similar swedish riksbank decade ago. however, also case condition different certain respects. one difference swedish credit money market deregulate completely 1980s early 1990s. this meant, instance, central government issue bonds, public auction predetermine times, actively attempt promote development secondary market. thus, already clear channel monetary policy could effect. another difference sweden support long tradition comprehensive production public statistic make work easier. these factor that, i understand it, apply extent vietnam, least yet. vietnam thus – like country – special condition may need take account may make difficult formulate monetary policy exact blueprint system 7 for detail discussion “central bank transparency”, see, instance, chapter 1 blinder, a.s., (2004), the quiet revolution – central bank go modern, yale university press. 6 bi review 21/2006 another country8. however, i would like say nevertheless principle guide monetary policy modern central banks, i describe here, general able act guide star monetary policy reform work anywhere world. essentially question give central bank carefully specify – realistic – objectives, grant independence endeavour meet objective ensure carry work transparent manner accountable actions. it conviction reform base principle beneficial vietnam, too. thank you. 8 it noted, instance, camen, u. h. genberg, (2005), ”an inflation target regime vietnam”, paper prepare vercon first annual conference, hanoi, may 24, draw conclusion condition introduce ”full fledge inflation targeting” yet fulfil vietnam. bi review 21/2006 7 toshihiko fukui: new framework conduct monetary policy - toward achieve sustainable economic growth price stability summary speech mr toshihiko fukui, governor bank japan, japan chamber commerce industry, tokyo,16 march 2006. * * * introduction at monetary policy meet (mpm) hold march 8 9, 2006, bank japan decide terminate quantitative ease policy, maintain five year since march 2001. the bank shift operate target money market operation outstanding balance current account bank short-term interest rate, namely, uncollateralized overnight call rate. it also introduce new framework monetary policy conduct, include clarification think price stability. today, i focus background termination quantitative ease policy look back economic financial development past years, explain bank's future monetary policy conduct. i. embark sustainable growth path japan's economy continue recover steadily. the current economic expansion start january 2002 last four years, accord cabinet office's reference date business cycles. the recent recovery well balance term balance domestic external demand, also corporate household sectors. although recovery accelerating, foundation economic growth solid, resistance various external shock increasing. the present phase recovery third since burst economic bubble. unlike previous two phases, time may reasonably expect current expansionary phase last long sustainable. japan's economy has, last, succeed emerge prolong adjustment phase, continue decade, embark sustainable growth path price stability. several factor support view. in addition external factors, continue expansion overseas economies, domestic side structural reform make significant progress business financial sectors. moreover, positive effect recovery spread household sector. i discus contribute factor go detail regard sustainability current economic recovery. a. progress structural reform the important factor contribute achievement sustain economic recovery elimination burdens, adjustment pressures, corporate sector financial system, hind japanese economy's movement sustainable growth path ever since burst economic bubble. a result stringent corporate restructure effort last decade, excess debt, employment, production capacity -- so-called "three excesses" -- part dispel resolved. accord late tankan (short-term economic survey enterprise japan), number firm perceive production capacity excessive almost equal number perceive insufficient first time since early 1990s. the number firm perceive hold labor insufficient already exceed number perceive excessive, indicate firm perceive tighten labor market. this tightness also evidence ratio job offer applicants, exceed 1.00. turn firms' debt levels, ratio interest-bearing debt sale peak around 1993, currently low see mid-1980s, bubble era. while take measure resolve "three excesses," firm review business line base principle "selection concentration" face intensify global competition. more specifically, firm adopt active management approach concentrate strategic bi review 20/2006 1 area business establish business tie-up improve ability generate high-value-added product services. a result, firm succeed substantially improve profitability. corporate profit increase three consecutive year fiscal 2002, expect continue increase current fiscal year. firms' ratio current profit sale already exceed peak mark bubble era. use high level corporate profits, firm actively invest research development expand production capacity order boost market competitiveness. these activity evident increase business fix investment, regardless type size firm. improvement also notable financial system. the nonperforming-loan (npl) problem plague japan's economy long large resolved, stability japanese financial system restored. the lend attitude financial institution become active result improvement profitability capital adequacy ratio due decrease amount npls. the amount outstanding lend private banks, long downward trend, finally turn upward year-on-year basis august 2005 adjustment securitization loan loan write-offs. since then, pace increase gradually accelerating. in previous two recovery phases, weakness financial system hind economy move onto sustainable growth path. at present, however, financial system recover level soundness sufficient firmly support achievement sustain economic growth. b. spread improvement corporate sector household sector in order realize sustainable economic recovery, important virtuous cycle operate economy, wherein improvement income corporate sector spread household sector, turn fee back corporate sector. unfortunately, past recovery phases, virtuous cycle fully operate, corporate sector financial system subject structural adjustment pressure. in contrast, current recovery phase, apparent improvement employment income situation observe since begin 2005, long sustainable recovery expect household sector. firm increase number employees, adjustment excessive hold labor progressed. initially, rely mainly part-time worker order restrain labor costs, firm begin gradually increase number regular employees, labor market tightened. wage per worker also rising, reflect condition labor market. specifically, regular payment recently begin increase addition continue growth overtime payment bonus payments. this improvement employment income situation, couple rise stock price increase dividend income, contribute income growth household sector. with income conditions, private consumption solid. it expect remain so, support increase household income. this development expect accelerate virtuous cycle firmness private consumption fee back corporate sector. a see i described, japan's economy continue solid recovery, recovery often say apply evenly across small firm regional economies. in fact, degree recovery still vary accord size firm region. the economic recovery indeed spread steadily, domestic external demand continue increase. the tankan indicate business condition large firm also small medium-sized one improving. the bank's branch conduct research interview grasp state regional economies, result present meet general manager bank's branches. the result show that, although still difference degree recovery, regional economy show improvement. the bank continue pay due attention future development regional economies. ii. improvement environment price the environment price become favorable reflect continue economic recovery. the year-on-year rate change consumer price index (cpi, exclude fresh food) negative since 1998, return 0.0 percent october 2005 turn positive november. accord figure release march 3, 2006, rise january 2006, reach 0.5 percent. this partly attributable dissipation temporary factor reduction 2 bi review 20/2006 telephone charge implement 2005 also high crude oil prices, importantly, fundamental factor affect price development clearly begin improve start exert upward pressure prices. first, supply-demand balance improve gradually improvement expect continue, economy continue recover pace slightly potential. second, although unit labor cost continue drive productivity increase, wage begin rise, rate decline diminish trend expect continue. and third, firms' households' expectation inflation gradually revise upward, indicate various surveys. all indicate environment price change dramatically past, substantial output gap exert downward pressure prices. a economy expect continue recover steadily balance maintain domestic external demand corporate household sectors, positive trend year-on-year rate change consumer price project established, albeit fluctuations. a i explained, japan's economy achieve substantial improvement, term economic activity prices, imply bank respond improvement change conduct monetary policy. iii. effect quantitative ease policy the bank display resolve continue quantitative ease policy five year introduce march 2001. at time, japan's economy recessionary phase trigger collapse it bubble around globe. financial institution japan also burden massive npls, high level public anxiety concern stability financial system. in circumstances, economy face severe challenge, potential risk fall vicious cycle, so-called deflationary spiral, fall demand reflect deterioration economy cause decline price turn lead fall demand. to counter situation, bank act decisively introduce quantitative ease policy, unprecedented history central bank, aim prevent continue fall price establish foundation achieve sustainable economic growth. i would like elaborate quantitative ease policy contribute japan's economy past five years. the quantitative ease policy consist two pillars: provision bank ample liquidity raise outstanding balance current account bank amount reserve financial institution require hold, namely, require reserves; commitment bank continue provide ample liquidity year-on-year rate change cpi (excluding fresh food) register zero percent high sustainable basis. provision ample liquidity exceed require reserve reduce short-term interest rate effectively zero percent dispel financial institutions' liquidity concern. after introduction quantitative ease policy, occurrence large-scale credit crunch, observe 1997 1998, stability financial market maintain despite materialization various shocks, include terrorist attack unite state iraq war well injection public fund major japanese bank financial system fragile. the bank's commitment continue quantitative ease policy generate expectation zero interest rate environment would continue certain period time consumer price continue decline. this refer "duration effect," is, effect bank's commitment regard duration policy. a result duration effect, bank's commitment contribute keep short- medium-term interest rate stable low levels. the policy effect dispel liquidity concern well keep interest rate low stable create accommodative environment money market capital market also corporate finance activities. bank lend rates, example, continue decline partly reflect decrease credit premium, around historically low levels, despite ongoing economic recovery. a mention earlier, japanese firms, strenuous efforts, tackle structural problem "three excesses," become increasingly active undertake business fix investment. the accommodative financial environment create quantitative ease policy firmly support developments. it could say policy contribute improve bi review 20/2006 3 rate return capital raise corporate profits, enable lend rate decline even economic outlook gradually brightening. these improvement corporate sector have, certain lag, exert positive effect household sector, thereby support continue economic recovery favorable environment price developments. the bank's quantitative ease policy play significant role recovery japan's economy improvement price developments. however, amid recent economic financial circumstances, effect quantity liquidity dispel liquidity concern duration effect bank's commitment influence interest rate consider play out. a financial system regain stability, liquidity demand financial institution declined, reduce need provision fund level well require reserves. in addition, duration effect policy commitment gradually diminish shorten expect duration quantitative ease policy line improvement price developments. ultimately, duration effect cease exist criterion year-on-year rate change cpi register zero percent high sustainable basis fulfilled. in short, effect quantitative ease policy economic activity price already become essentially equivalent interest rate policy target short-term interest rate zero percent prior termination quantitative ease policy. iv. background termination quantitative ease policy in situation, bank decide terminate quantitative ease policy mpm hold march 8 9, 2006. the bank decide change operate target money market operation outstanding balance current account bank uncollateralized overnight call rate, set guideline money market operation intermeeting period follows: "the bank japan encourage uncollateralized overnight call rate remain effectively zero percent." the year-on-year rate change cpi register zero percent four consecutive month since october 2005, positive trend rate change cpi project established. economic development underlie cpi also indicate japan's economy likely experience sustain period expansion domestic external demand well balance. base development economic activity prices, bank judge commitment would continue quantitative ease policy year-on-year rate change cpi register zero percent high sustainable basis fulfilled, therefore appropriate terminate unprecedented quantitative ease policy. it must stress termination quantitative ease policy signify tighten monetary policy. a i explained, policy effect quantitative ease policy already become essentially equivalent interest rate policy target short-term interest rate zero percent. since bank encourage uncollateralized overnight call rate remain effectively zero percent base new guideline money market operations, abrupt change monetary policy term stimulative effect quantitative ease policy economic activity prices. the effect short-term interest rate effectively zero percent increase gradually upturn economic activity prices, expect become strong current guideline maintained. although level interest rate depend development economic activity price well financial markets, judge inflationary pressure restrain economy follow balance sustainable growth path, accommodative monetary environment ensue low interest rate probably maintain time. the bank continue offer firm support economy maintain accommodative monetary conditions. some might question bank terminate quantitative ease policy policy effect equivalent interest rate policy target short-term interest rate zero percent. however, bank make clear commitment introduce quantitative ease policy would continue policy year-on-year rate change cpi register zero percent high sustainable basis, market participant conduct transaction premise. the duration effect policy commitment could achieve without market participants' confidence commitment. in regard, termination quantitative ease policy bank judge commitment fulfil contribute enhance monetary policy transparency turn effectiveness monetary policy long term. put another way, bank continue conduct monetary policy line operate target 4 bi review 20/2006 already essentially lose effectiveness, could well cause increase uncertainty financial market also damage transparency monetary policy. v. conduct money market operation immediate future in conduct money market operation immediate future, bank reduce outstanding balance current account toward level line require reserve accord new guideline money market operations. it bear mind, however, financial institution manage liquidity backdrop large amount current account balance extensive funds-supplying operation bank prolong period quantitative ease policy, function money market somewhat impaired. a result, financial institution may difficulty carry smooth fund management. give circumstances, bank's reduction current account balance implement take full account condition money market. how long take bank reduce current account balance depend situation money market, reasonable expect reduction carry period months. with respect complementary lend facility, allow financial institution borrow short-term fund bank request amount collateral pledge advance, bank decide keep loan rate unchanged 0.1 percent, level prior termination quantitative ease policy. this mean uncollateralized overnight call rate, effectively zero percent accordance new guideline money market operations, basically exceed ceiling 0.1 percent even surge temporarily. reduction outstanding balance current account bank manage short-term money market operations. with respect outright purchase long-term japanese government bonds, continue current amount frequency time, due regard future condition bank's balance sheet. vi. introduction new framework conduct monetary policy follow late mpm, bank announce introduction new framework conduct monetary policy, view ensure transparency policy conduct give shift quantitative ease policy interest rate policy. under quantitative ease policy, bank conduct monetary policy line commitment base cpi. the commitment unprecedented link conduct monetary policy directly specific economic indicator, namely, cpi. with aim generate monetary ease effect situation room reduce short-term interest rates, bank introduce unprecedented policy affect formation interest rates, spite acknowledge concomitant sacrifice flexibility would able conduct monetary policy. such policy measure never previously adopt central bank, may safely see monetary policy innovation design bank japan. a i explain earlier, bank's commitment regard duration policy significant positive effect operate keep short- medium-term interest rate stable low level maintain accommodative environment corporate financing. however, time, policy extent undermine price function financial markets. with prospect sustainable economic growth long-term price stability, monetary policy general conduct forward-looking manner -- words, implement take future development economic activity price fully consideration -- flexible timely. in current situation economy emerge prolong period structural adjustment move toward path sustainable growth, new framework introduce ensure monetary policy conduct appropriately sufficient transparency. give bank's think conduct monetary policy, market participants, part, view interest rate development thereby make decision financial transactions, forecast future course monetary policy base assessment economic activity prices. such process facilitate proper function price mechanism financial market turn generate economic dynamism efficient allocation funds. three element underlie new framework conduct monetary policy. bi review 20/2006 5 first, bank clarify think price stability, state objective monetary policy. specifically, bank make public basic think price stability, and, regard conduct monetary policy, disclose level inflation rate policy board member currently understand price stability medium- long-term viewpoint. second, bank explain two perspective examine economic activity price determine conduct monetary policy. third, bank decide that, deliberation two perspectives, outline think conduct monetary policy immediate future, and, rule, disclose periodically outlook economic activity price (hereafter outlook report). now i elaborate three elements. a. clarify bank's think price stability the bank japan law stipulate objective monetary policy "contributing sound development national economy" "through pursuit price stability." in accomplish state objective, thus important bank clearly indicate public think price stability. price stability define state various economic agent include household firm able make decision regard economic activity consumption investment without concern fluctuation general price level. when consider constitute price stability purpose conduct monetary policy, central bank take full account distinctive feature countries' economic structure influence public's view prices. in case japan, one noteworthy feature regard average rate inflation, which, last decades, low major overseas economies. specifically, average inflation rate major country 1985 2005, measure cpi, follows: 3.2 percent unite states, 2.9 percent unite kingdom, 1.8 percent germany, 0.6 percent japan. a japanese economy protract experience low inflation since 1990s, rate inflation household firm perceive price stability seem low, economic decision likely make premise similarly low-inflation environment. these feature take duly consideration conduct monetary policy. at late mpm, take account point i described, discussion level inflation policy board member, conduct monetary policy, currently understand price stability medium- long-term viewpoint. such level refer member's "understanding medium- long-term price stability." there range view among policy board members, seem reflect difference view japanese economic structure, well difference assessment cost inflation deflation. they concurred, however, that, current situation, level japan somewhat low major overseas economies. they also agree that, make use rate year-on-year change cpi describe understanding, approximate range zero 2 percent generally consistent distribution member's understand medium- long-term price stability. most policy board members' median figure fell side 1 percent. give "understanding medium- long-term price stability" may change gradually, reflect change economic structure progress globalization innovation information communication technologies, rule, policy board member review annually. b. examine economic activity price two perspective have clarify think price stability, bank's next step decide examine economic activity price light thinking, devise way incorporate analysis conduct monetary policy. although important clarify bank's think price stability, sufficient develop actual policy guideline conduct monetary policy. the significant issue face central bank, regardless whether adopt inflation target not, provide information make easy public predict future course monetary policy enhance effectiveness. for instance, suppose central bank conduct policy base certain mechanical rules. although rule would enhance transparency policy, would incapable cop flexibly various economic shock hit economy. they would therefore fail meet original purpose 6 bi review 20/2006 enhance transparency, improve effectiveness monetary policy. to date, bank release assessment current state outlook economic activity price monthly report recent economic financial development outlook report. henceforth, bank decide supplement assessment additional examination economic activity price follow two perspectives, particular relevance conduct monetary policy, release them. the first perspective involve examining, regard economic activity price one two year future, whether outlook deem likely bank follow path sustainable growth price stability. it add that, order implement appropriate policy achieve sustainable growth price stability, sufficient merely ass economic price situation accord first perspective. needle say, forecast entail uncertainty. it reason bank's outlook report contain detail description regard upward downward risk affect scenario deem likely bank. among risk factors, significant impact economic activity price materialize, even though likelihood materialization low. such risk include fall deflationary spiral, conversely, risk spark inflation generate asset price bubble. in conduct monetary policy, bank need utmost prevent materialization potential risks. the economic projection describe outlook report cover period one half two years. there could, however, risk factor might affect economic activity price development medium long term, beyond outlook report's projection period. experience inside outside japan show wide swing asset price significant change financial environment, include affect intermediation function financial institutions, may impact economic activity price development considerable lag. in addition, public's longer-term expectation inflation change, significant impact exist relationship economic activity prices. the second perspective, therefore, involve examining, long horizon, various risk relevant conduct monetary policy aim realize sustainable growth price stability. major central bank seem share opinion conduct monetary policy put much emphasis achieve price stability short term result large swing economic activity, turn impede long-term price stability sound development economy. c. conduct monetary policy immediate future lastly, third element new framework conduct monetary policy, bank outline current view monetary policy light deliberation two perspective i described, disclose periodically, rule outlook report. on current occasion, bank decide release result deliberation ahead release april outlook report, coincide time termination quantitative ease policy. look ahead, consider central scenario economic activity prices, high probability realize sustainable growth price stability. a i mention earlier, however, backdrop improve corporate profitability positive turn price developments, possibility monetary policy stimulus economic activity price could amplify via, example, decline real interest rates. if stimulus become strong, risk that, even current price stable, investment activity could become excessive, result volatile economic fluctuations. moreover, could negatively affect prospect sustainable economic growth long-term price stability. in conduct monetary policy, bank pay attention well long-term risks. bear mind, i would like touch bank's think regard future path monetary policy. there period uncollateralized overnight call rate effectively zero percent, follow gradual adjustment light development economic activity prices. in process, risk i describe remain muted, words, judge inflationary pressure restrain economy follow balance sustainable growth path, accommodative monetary environment ensue low interest rate probably maintain time. this complete explanation new framework conduct monetary policy introduce last week. the bank central bank make continuous effort clearly explain think bi review 20/2006 7 conduct monetary policy market participant public. the specific method employed, however, differ accord economic environment institutional framework. at bank, introduce new framework study practice central bank adopt element consider relevant, importantly devise appropriate framework clearly explain conduct monetary policy light japan's economic situation. although new framework different from, example, inflation targeting, numerical target price stability set achieve within certain time frame, nevertheless new framework improve transparency bank's monetary policy objective indicate think constitute price stability. take account, bank examine economic activity price two perspective explain earlier, release view conduct monetary policy immediate future. for japan's economy, emerge prolong recession enter new phase, bank belief new policy framework suitable enhance transparency conduct monetary policy appropriately. this new framework also expect contribute smooth price formation financial market participant find uncharted territory termination unprecedented quantitative ease policy. conclusion today, i elaborate current state japan's economy, enter new phase, well provide detail new framework conduct monetary policy introduce last week. under new framework, bank continue conduct monetary policy appropriately, respond flexibly change economic activity prices, contribute sustainable economic growth price stability. 8 bi review 20/2006 arnold schilder: bank compliance challenge speech professor arnold schilder, chairman bcbs account task force executive director govern board netherlands bank, asian banker summit, bangkok, 16 march 2006. * * * compliance risk become one major risk bank facing. the increase globalization, issue corporate governance complex institutions, change law regulations, understand constitute sound risk management, continuous evolution financial product create complex situation bank operate cross border basis. one may wonder whether compliance framework place robust enough effectively manage rapidly change factors. create “best class” compliance framework seem best way forward. the development implementation framework might well challenge equal implementation basel ii. introduction the subject speech challenge bank face today respect compliance. you may wonder - why? the main reason deliver speech topic recently see bank involve compliance relate problems. riggs bank act well know example problems. in july 2004, u.s. senate permanent subcommittee investigation committee governmental affair publish report riggs bank. the evidence review subcommittee staff establish that, since least 1997, riggs bank disregard anti-money launder obligations, maintain dysfunctional anti-money launder program allow or, times, actively facilitate suspicious financial activity1. in recent case de nederlandsche bank, together relevant regulator unite states, issue cease desist order respect abn amro bank. the reason order order compliance issues. the problem abn amro face with, albeit le far-reaching riggs bank, act another example compliance relate deficiencies. another reason speech find publication paper ‘compliance compliance function banks’ publish basel committee bank supervision (bcbs) april 2005. in relate press release 29 april 2005, bcbs chairman caruana said: “compliance emerge distinct branch risk management within bank system2.” so fully appropriate timely address important topic conference’s broad context sound risk management banks. compliance risk quickly become one major risk bank facing. so effort bank undertake concern compliance, may become comparable size importance endeavour bank relation implementation new basel ii capital accord. however, unlike various risk discuss new capital accord, hold additional capital ‘cover’ compliance risk act mitigate factor. other effort needed. during first part speech i briefly discus understand compliance. then i go depth nature compliance relate problem banks, entire financial world encountering. subsequently, close look compliance really imply international standard-setting body perceive compliance. i discus issue involve abn amro case lesson learned. i conclude broad perspective approach challenge ahead. 1 case study involve riggs bank, unite state senate, permanent subcommittee investigations, committee governmental affairs, release 15 july 2004, page 2. 2 press release 29 april 2005, www.bis.org/press/p050429.htmbis review 20/2006 1 scope definition compliance the notion ‘compliance’ literally mean ‘obedience’ ‘dutifulness’. it broad scope. a know various interpretations. to avoid misunderstand speech, i provide definition use basel committee. in compliance function paper, committee define compliance risk “the risk legal regulatory sanctions, material financial loss, loss reputation bank may suffer result failure comply laws, regulations, rules, relate self-regulatory organization standards, code conduct applicable bank activities”3. hence, compliance generally cover matter observe proper standard market conduct, manage conflict interest treat customer fairly. also, compliance typically include specific area prevention money launder terrorist financing, may extend tax law relevant structure bank product customer advice4. in opinion, compliance function protect institution unlawful behaviour strengthen ethical consciousness. driver compliance relate problem a supervisor provide framework guidance financial sector facilitate function financial world - although i aware effort may always perceive industry. in end, however, industry supervisor serve goal, create stable prosperous financial industry worldwide. it essential client confident solidity financial institution assure salary pay bank account safe. so, industry well standard-setting body always reflect irregularity consider whether current risk control framework place still adequate warrant stability. by adequate i mean framework effective industry well supervisory community. it therefore essential consider possible underlie driver recent compliance relate irregularities. if look financial world today, one great challenge rapid globalization world economy. new economy china india emerging, rapidly attract investor financial institutions. this globalization take place traditional way, i.e. businesses´ presence country concerned. what i personally find fascinate current trend regard outsourcing, offshoring ‘smart sourcing’. not long ago, i observe service provider india even play along different time zone customer locate tailor work shift employee time zones. a first complication globally operate financial institution face consequence globalization, relate corporate governance, especially head office oversight. of course, board director approve oversee bank’s strategic objectives, set desire compliance culture. also, board ensure institution adequate policy procedure ensure head office oversight activity carry various business lines. however, give increase complexity ‘cross border’ institutions, sound easy is. the board ensure adequate control place oversee decision make senior management, ensure entire organisation act line set objectives, desire compliance culture. this raise kind organisational managerial questions, vary amount autonomy business line have, issue regard control framework report lines. there easy answer. secondly, financial institution make sure comply applicable law regulation jurisdiction operate. a result increase globalization, financial institution nowadays make sure compliant law extraterritorial effects. these different legal requirement pose challenge institution operate cross border. another challenge understand constitute sound operational management continuously changing. what understand sound operational management five year ago 3 compliance compliance function banks, basel committee bank supervision, april 2005, paragraph 3. 4 compliance compliance function banks, basel committee bank supervision, april 2005, paragraph 4. 2 bi review 20/2006 long applies. the recent best practice paper produce basel committee sustain view understand adequate operational management rapidly changing5. the number standard regulation bank adhere to, tremendous definition accordance bank practice conduct businesses. the development new product increase complexity product offer financial institutions, make life even difficult. the specific risk complex product global distribution, analyze bank include global risk management framework. give ongoing evolution financial market asia, essential institutions, like ours, analyze compliance risk relate financial product sell them, especially since product continue evolve. the increase globalization, issue corporate governance complex institutions, continuously change understand constitute sound operational management, change law regulations, well ongoing evolution product - combine determination government regulator fight money laundering, terrorist finance illegal financial transaction - create complex situation bank operate cross border. the unavoidable conclusion bank need address compliance challenge risk management program global basis, stringent requirement quickly become benchmark. when reflect challenges, one may wonder whether compliance framework place robust enough effectively manage challenge risk financial institution face. what, then, late development concern compliance framework? close look compliance during last couple years, various international standard-setting body publish paper compliance relate issues. for instance, response increasingly sophisticate money-laundering technique financial action task force revise recommendation 2003. also, basel committee bank supervision publish paper customer due diligence 2001 consolidate know your customer paper 20046. the cause paper supervisor around world increasingly recognize importance bank adequate control procedure place know customer deal with. also, basel committee publish paper compliance organization compliance function 2005. this paper provide guidance embed compliance organization within credit institutions. the compliance definition use basel committee consider sanctions, loss reputation, institution may suffer result failure comply laws, regulation standards. a laws, regulation standard continuously changing, compliance become move target. the question arise observation one continuously ask oneself: “how i sure organization compliant”? the change occur high-speed one may well “compliant” today long tomorrow. today’s challenge tomorrow’s history. the compliance function paper emphasize compliance start top. compliance effective - not, effective - corporate culture emphasize standard honesty integrity. the board director senior management lead example. the tone top vital culture awareness. the board director responsible oversee management bank’s compliance risk. to end, board committee board least year ass extent bank manage compliance risk effectively7. have say this, compliance require continuous attention board director senior management; responsibility limit yearly assessment. compliance imply great 5 e.g. paper publish basel committee internal audit function, compliance function, operational risk (very recently) corporate governance. 6 customer due diligence banks, basel committee bank supervision, october 2001, consolidate kyc risk management, basel committee bank supervision, october 2004. 7 compliance compliance function banks, basel committee bank supervision, april 2005, paragraph 14 et seq. bi review 20/2006 3 involvement board directors, especially since widely accept board ultimately responsible operation soundness bank8. without disclaim ultimate responsibility board directors, responsibility effective management bank’s compliance risk reside bank’s senior management. one important responsibility senior management regard compliance make sure main compliance risk issue institution facing, identify assess annual basis. subsequently, senior management - assistance compliance function - ensure plan prepare manage risks. such plan address shortfall (policy, procedures, implementation execution) relate effectively exist compliance risk managed, well need additional policy procedure deal new compliance risk identify result annual compliance risk assessment9. this risk assessment, together subsequent introduction improvement control framework, form essential step ongoing process ensure adequate control risk bank face with. aside responsibility board director senior management, paper also mention principle concern status responsibility compliance function. it essential compliance function formal status within bank. this order give compliance function appropriate standing, authority, independence10. the responsibility compliance function assist senior management manage effectively compliance risk face bank. specifically mean compliance function should: • advise senior management; • provide guidance education employee compliance issues; • identify, measure ass compliance risks; • monitor test compliance report find report line accordance bank’s internal risk management procedures. once more, i would like stress importance timely identification, measurement assessment compliance risks. cite compliance function paper “the compliance function should, pro-active basis, identify, document ass compliance risk associate bank’s business activities, include development new product business practices, propose establishment new type business customer relationship, material change nature relationships”. the paper continue state compliance function consider way measure compliance risk (e.g. use performance indicators) use measurement enhance compliance risk assessment. it ass appropriateness bank’s compliance procedure guidelines, promptly follow identify deficiency formulate proposal amendments11. institution expect tailor control measure risk classification clients, product implement specific control measure nature severity compliance risk pose category. therefore, question one need answer organisation is: “how i sure organisation compliant?” the abn amro case12recently, importance adequate compliance function illustrate event take place within abn amro, one large credit institution headquarter netherlands, one large internationally operate bank worldwide. 8 enhance corporate governance bank organisations, basel committee bank supervision, february 2006, paragraph 17. 9 compliance compliance function banks, basel committee bank supervision, april 2005, paragraph 18. 10 compliance compliance function banks, basel committee bank supervision, april 2005, paragraph 22. 11 compliance compliance function banks, basel committee bank supervision, april 2005, paragraph 37 et seq. 12 this section base publicly available information, www.dnb.nl, www.federalreserve.org, www.abnamro.com. 4 bi review 20/2006 those read abn amro’s press release 19 december 2005, relate website publication regulator the netherlands unite states, subsequent press publications, may already familiar case. however, not, i’ll provide brief overview. in july 2004, abn amro sign so-called write agreement u bank regulator concern compliance-related deficiencies, identify regulator u dollar clear activity abn amro new york. these deficiency relate case non-compliance unite states’ bank secrecy act ofac regulation (the unite states’ sanction regime). this write agreement, address abn amro’s anti-money launder policies, procedure practices, design correct deficiencies. in response write agreement, abn amro strengthen compliance function anti-money launder programme new york. many measure take achieve best-in-class compliance programme. these measure vary centralisation increase compliance function implementation new it-support systems. nevertheless, remediation process abn amro identify shortcoming one overseas offices. investigation audit department reveal certain employee branch, without enforcement knowledge anyone outside branch, observe bank’s policy standard relation certain u dollar payment instruction send bank’s u dollar clear centre new york behalf libyan iranian clients. under eu legislation, abn amro allow deal say counterparties. nonetheless, unite states’ ofac regime impose certain limitations. further investigation bank make clear procedure aim include certain client-specific information relevant payment instructions. a such, ensure payment would pas new yorkbranch’ ofac filter without detect blocked. have inform abn amro procedures, unite state bank regulator de nederlandsche bank conclude constitute pattern unsafe unsound practice warrant enforcement action13. on 19 december 2005, “order cease desist” issue joint regulators, require abn amro undertake comprehensive additional measure - addition measure already undertake response write agreement. amongst others, additional measure relate to: • submission u.s. law compliance programme, ensure continuous compliance state federal law unite states; • improvement head office oversight ensure effective control supervision foreign branches; • completion write plan improve effectiveness management oversight unite states. on top “cease desist order”, usbank regulator impose fine amount u dollar 75 million, voluntary endowment u dollar 5 million illinois bank examiners´ education foundation. lesson learn it go without say abn amro’s supervisory board manage board respectively, order detail analysis compliance-related incidents, ensure lesson learn would beneficial future. in addition institution themselves, regulatory community must learn incident well. give severe impact incidents, important regulatory community financial institution reflect whether so-called “principle based” approach adequate area. the reality appropriate compliance mean adhere many rule various jurisdictions. so even supervisor apply principle base approach, least financial institution need 13 page 3 order cease desist issue upon consent issue de nederlandsche bank u regulators. bi review 20/2006 5 couple rule base instructions. some bank introduce mix risk-based rule-based compliance programs. my point supervisor industry need reflect paradigms. it either principle rules, rather intelligent combination principle rules. another issue warrant consideration “awareness cultivation”. it widely believe compliance always forefront employees’ thinking. nevertheless, modification u dollar payment instruction act example deliberate attempt employee dodge internal external regulations. clearly, employee lack desire mindset. train counsel remain important tool create desire mindset: help employee good understand requirement regulation itself, also “why” requirements. unfortunately, train alone always suffice get message through. it remain difficult deal issue, alternative solution inconceivable. you, senior management supervise institutions, continue have, course, exemplary role within organisation. this enable influence staffs´ behaviour act shin examples. in addition, interest approach senior management might want consider, relate annual appraisal staff members. in addition traditional commercial objective usually dominate appraisal process, one might consider include compliance-related objectives. such objectives, course, remain difficult measure and, therefore, require careful consideration; proverb “haste make waste” certainly applicable here. however, grow usage performance objective bank like abn amro tool influence employees´ behaviour, illustrate - properly apply - merits. i convince importance factor continue grow, netherlandsbut also asia. in end however, whereas aforementioned factor undoubtedly contribute observance internal external requirement regulations, belief tool ‘par excellence’ achieve compliance remain combination control enforcement. “control” increase possibility caught, either internal control body like audit- compliance function external authority like bank regulators. and “enforcement” exact compliance rules, regulation requirements. parallel basel ii in begin speech i make brief comparison compliance new basel capital accord. i imagine may wonder afore-mentioned new basel capital accord. and yes, seem little convergence capital requirement lay accord, today’s challenge regard compliance. there are, however, interest link i would like highlight. “compliance risk” swiftly become one important risk driver credit institution facing. firstly, adequate control prevent, example, money launder terrorist finance unacceptable regulators, - illustrate fine levy abn amro unite states- hesitate take formal measure institutions. secondly, perhaps even importantly, involvement serious compliance relate incident lead reputational damage, impact may even large regulatory interference. a confidence remain one financial sector’s cornerstones, substantial impairment institution’s reputation could well lead collapse. nevertheless, whereas basel accord, course, require institution set aside capital cover credit-, market operational risk, “compliance risk” covered. be miss opportunity? should draft panel new capital accord spend time concept like “compliance capital”? in opinion, require institution set aside capital cover loss compliance incident issue. i believe justify basel committee include compliance risk capital accord. whereas (potential) credit loss financially compensate hold additional capital, compliance incident mitigate financial means. after all, compliance incident impact reputation credit institution, cannot measure financial terms. compliance financial matter, matter principle. nevertheless, question position compliance continue intrigue me. 6 bi review 20/2006 you undoubtedly aware pillar ii (the so-called supervisory review process) new capital accord deal (amongst others) treatment risk fully cover requirement pillar 114. under pillar ii, accord require bank address material risk face capital assessment process, even risk cannot measure quantify precisely15. bank expect develop technique manage unquantifiable risk like reputational risk16. although language capital accord give impression ‘something’ need done, also imply hold additional capital unquantifiable risk solution. so, solution? i would argue that, whereas remain necessary mitigate compliance risks, structure coherent approach necessary. a previously discussed, bank face challenge like increase globalization, issue corporate governance complex institutions, continuously change understand constitute sound operational management, change law ongoing evolution products. at time, requirement best practice impose legislators, supervisor international standard setting-bodies necessarily attune other. those work internationally active bank recognize difficulty bring day-to-day practice. one important step towards solve difficulty bring requirement best practice together. this entail monitor implication requirement best practice put effort find workable solution possible improve consistency standard already available. in mind, one big challenge supervisory legislative community upcoming years. but know work hard here, amongst others bcbs accord implementation group core principle liaison group. in end effort result also entail new challenge bank themselves. it widely realise implement new basel accord huge burden financial institutions, complexity materials, also sheer size implementation project. the development implementation consistent international compliance framework, might well challenge equal size. new policy written, approve implemented, procedure developed, it-systems (e.g. automate system facilitate transaction filter - monitoring) installed, staff member train control measure put place detect correct deficiencies. the amount work do abn amro response cease desist order result comprehensive extensive plans. this illustrative effort might well desire benchmark entire financial industry. close remark i highlight challenge bank face today respect compliance compliance function amidst ongoing increase globalization, issue corporate governance complex institutions, continuously change understand constitute sound risk management, change law regulations, continuous evolution financial products, determination government regulator fight money laundering, terrorist finance illegal financial transactions. therefore i expect importance “compliance” continue grow exponentially. at moment, multiple requirement best practice regard compliance already issued. nevertheless, view create “best class” compliance framework integrate requirement best practice become main priority, regulator industry. i realize easy, i convince best way forward. 14 par. 724 new capital accord. 15 par. 732 new capital accord. 16

slide speech find bank finland’s website. * * * economic growth eu sluggish recent years, despite robust world economy. a matter fact, growth strong almost part world except western europe. the weak performance euro area economy recent year due monetary policy. on contrary, interest rate low – long short term rates. neither exchange rate blame sluggish growth. the external value euro level would hurt overall price competitiveness euro area industries. therefore, look elsewhere reason unsatisfactory growth performance. weak demographic trend one factor restrain growth eu economy compare many part world. in future, negative demographic trend continue. in addition, rise oil price recent year hold back growth eu. unfortunately, economic policy cannot much reduce effect demographic oil price growth. luckily, however, also issue economic policy deal order increase europe's growth potential. let u turn those. it appear european economy able take advantage new technology globalisation effectively unite states. the growth labour productivity u.s. exceed eu since mid 1990s. this table show difference productivity increase eu u.s. largely due development it good produce sector, – even importantly – service sector. within services, retail trade, wholesale trade, financial service count diverge productivity developments. these sector important user it. indeed, seem lot unexploited potential eu come labour productivity. first all, productivity improve within industry within firm. secondly, aggregate labour productivity also raise exit industry firm weak productivity, entry good productivity. public authority facilitate improvement kind remove obstacle productive private sector. in eu, obstacle largely relate national boundary regulation private businesses. policy measure promote competition economic integration within eu significantly enhance productivity, employment, economic growth. the relation competition productivity focus significant amount research recent years. several study suggest increase competition normally increase innovation thereby productivity (e.g. aghion et al. 2002).1 this company monopoly power le need reform innovate. * * * apart effect competition innovations, also directly improve allocation resource economy. this beneficial characteristic competitive market accord basic microeconomic theory. competition increase production low prices. a recent study investigate macroeconomic benefit economic reform promote competition. these study utilise modern dynamic general equilibrium models. simulation perform model show effect increase competition, essentially start effect familiar basic microeconomic theory. 1 aghion, philippe – bloom, nicholas – blundell, richard – griffith, rachel – howitt, peter (2002): competition innovation: an inverted-u relationship. nber work paper no. 9269. bi review 19/2006 1 one study focus euro area. it investigate increase competition affect euro area itself, well rest industrial world.2 it assume competition increase product labour markets. in language model, mean mark-ups diminish price wages. the mark-ups define deviation price wage theoretical case perfect competition. the study assume competition euro area increase much reach estimate level u.s. economy. this mean price mark-up decline 12 percentage point (35 % → 23 %) wage mark-up 14 percentage point (30 % → 16 %). the central result study show slide. the slide show long-run effect increase competition: first, product market and, second, labour market. the combine effect show last column table. production, consumption, employment increase case. in addition, investment expands, increase production require increase capital stock. one note table show value variable such, show much differ baseline case change level competition. it assume study significant increase competition. therefore, estimate consequence dramatic. euro area gdp increase much 12.4 % case present last column table. the product market reform great effect labour market reform, particularly production investment. regard employment, effect labour market reform almost large. outside euro area, positive spill-over effects. this partly foreign consumer benefit decline price good produce euro area. one way look result study consider tell u possible future adjustment u.s. current account. accord results, competition enhance reform euro area would make adjustment le painful euro area itself, well rest world. in finland, increase competition would benefit economy much way case whole euro area. this show simulation study make bank finland. the study us dynamic general equilibrium model finnish economy, aino model bank finland. again, effect increase competition product labour market studied. the result briefly report bank finland bulletin, first issue 2005. the result summarise slide. the slide show effect decrease price wage mark-ups finnish economy. both short-run long-run effect shown. the long-run effect small previous slide. this study concern finland, assume increase competition much smaller. the price mark-ups assume decline 2 percentage point wage mark-ups 5 percentage points. two-thirds increase gdp due increase competition product markets, one-third due increase competition labour market. again, one note figure slide show value variable such, rather deviation baseline case change competition. for example, level real wage two year 0.4 % high would without increase competition. the next slide show effect increase competition propagate economy. in long run, increase competition boost production, consumption, employment. obviously, increase competition benefit every agent economy. there decrease profit firm face reduction monopoly power. also, short run development affect fact resource shift production consumer good production investment goods. this early increase investment due need large capital stock support long-run increase level gdp. indeed, consumption decrease short run. however, long run increase almost much gdp. 2 bayoumi, tamim – laxton, douglas – pesenti, paolo (2004): benefit and spillover of great competition in europe: a macroeconomic assessment. nber work paper no. 10416. 2 bi review 19/2006 of course, model simulation provide rough estimate effect economic reforms. however, qualitative result clear: increase competition boost gdp welfare. one also keep mind result base direct effect degree competition resource allocation. a i mention earlier, competition also increase innovation thereby productivity. this effect come top indicate study discussed. * * * a i already point out, growth labour productivity service sector slow europe u.s., financial service production among sector large difference productivity performance. moreover, discuss europe's growth potential, development financial service sector far important direct contribution productivity growth would suggest. the development financial service crucial dynamism europe's economy. the function financial service financial market economy twofold. first, banks, capital markets, part financial system play central role evaluating, trimming, promote innovation business ideas. in way, financial sector take part develop economy, time act intermediary supply finance need it. the second central task financial sector relate payment systems. they form basic structure make financial market operate one entity. without well-functioning payment system market would fragmented: locally, regionally, nationally. broad competitive financial market impossible without efficient unify payment system. financial integration within eu offer great opportunity improve europe's growth potential. the integration promote economic growth several reasons: • first all, require return investment project reduced, finance available low price. this increase investment employ-ment. • second, consumer benefit directly small interest rate margin decrease service fees. • third, great variety financial service become available. this add benefit customer financial service sector. • in addition, financial integration increase stability eu economy, integrate financial system balance risk countries. the effect country specific fluctuation dampen share evenly, cross border ownership trade financial claim increase. in u.s., significant part call asymmetric region specific income fluctuation neutralise integrate financial system. the common monetary policy create another, specific need euro area financial system integrate possible. integration reduce asymmetry effect monetary policy across countries. today, common monetary policy integrate internal market financial services. a lot already do within eu promote financial integration. an important instrument process financial service action plan (fsap). it contain 42 measures, almost adopt eu level. however, national implementation many measure still incomplete. a continuation fsap form measure already discussed. ultimately, integration eu financial system, however, result authorities' action regulation. integration realize market participant change way business. the task authority remove obstacle integration take care development regulatory supervisory framework. the three main area financial integration proceed relate market infrastructures. the first create common european market retail banking. here, development payment system play important role. secondly, security clear settlement system need make integrate efficient. the third area progress need integration coordination financial supervision. of three areas, i next briefly focus security trade. bi review 19/2006 3 a problem security market current lack depth integration. an important challenge fragmentation clear settlement systems. it important factor behind high price security transaction europe. this apply particularly trade equities. the cost equity transaction across national border within eu much four time cost similar transaction u.s. it exactly cost prevent integration equity markets. they hurt issuer stock via reduce price. the provider financial services, turn, face high costs. the infrastructure market strong effect location transaction businesses. in situation, current national feature clear settlement system evaluate point view future integrate european market. 4 bi review 19/2006 süreyya serdengeçti: inflation target – performance challenge open speech mr süreyya serdengeçti, governor central bank republic turkey, conference inflation targeting: performance challenges, istanbul, 19 january 2006. * * * lady gentlemen, i would like welcome all. it great honor open conference entitle “inflation targeting: performance challenges”. i please host distinguish guest i’d like thank join u istanbul share knowledge experience inflation targeting. the inflation target regime adopt grow number countries, especially emerge market countries, last fifteen years. a economic political condition emerge market country generally consider vulnerable unstable, country perceive inflation target credible safe “way out”, successful experience industrialize countries. turkey new member club. we study experience 20 industrialize emerge market country work general framework inflation target regime turkey. along experiences, historical, socio-political economic dynamic turkish economy take account create model specific turkey. i believe country adopt regime future benefit experience others. with motivation, i would like talk main characteristic period transition inflation target regime country, period indeed last long planned, main issue face period. i strongly convince important lesson draw turkish experience. distinguish guests, the turkish economy live 30 year high volatile inflation rate massive dollarization together financial sector instability, high public sector debt burden unstable low growth rates. live weakness long period time create strong inertia inflation dynamics. besides, latter half period, currency crisis 1994, contagion effect asian russian crisis 1997 1998, finally financial crisis 2001 among many event increase vulnerability economy. all development negatively affect economic social life, highlight importance price stability primary goal monetary policy make u realize importance transparent framework monetary policy clear nominal anchor. accordingly, macroeconomic policy framework undergo major change institutional arrangement introduce since financial crisis 2001. in context, float exchange rate regime introduced; central bank law amend primary objective central bank been, first time history, define achieve maintain price stability. together changes, new economic program entitle “strengthening turkish economy-turkey’s transition program” launch may 2001. this new program address two main issue chronic inflation high public debt tight monetary fiscal policy back structural reforms. in environment, central bank need introduce transparent monetary policy regime clear nominal anchor shape inflation expectations, inflation inertia big problem authority lack credibility. the choice exchange rate nominal anchor question: the exchange rate base stabilization program abandon total loss confidence. the option could use monetary aggregate nominal anchor. however, good candidate couple reasons: one, monetary target implicitly incorporate inflation target ultimate objective monetary policy rely forward look assessment respond shocks; pure form regime consider money ignore potential information contain non-monetary variables. two, success monetary target regime rely two assumption velocity money entirely predictable inflation solely determine money growth. unfortunately, turkey live bi review 19/2006 1 environment. it difficult predict money demand chronically high inflation environment unstable. moreover, link inflation monetary aggregate stable neither. the final alternative choice inflation nominal anchor obviously refer “inflation target regime”. in addition anchor, highly transparent, inflation target view superior monetary policy regime available information use monetary policy decision make process. besides features, fred mishkin (2000) instance address follow favorable aspect inflation-targeting regime: “because explicit numerical target inflation increase accountability central bank, inflation target also potential reduce likelihood central bank fall time – inconsistency trap. moreover, since source time inconsistency often find political pressure central bank undertake overly expansionary monetary policy, inflation target advantage focus political debate central bank long run.” on hand, widely discuss literature, success regime depend fulfillment necessary precondition central bank independence, sound well-developed financial sector absence fiscal dominance. at time, long “fiscal dominance” history turkish economy severely restrict efficiency monetary policy shallow financial market well develop primary characteristic turkish economy. all limit economy’s room maneuver eve adoption new monetary policy regime. independence central bank turkey come 2001, almost institutional factor hand time way towards ultimate objective price stability. give overall framework conditions, central bank turkey prefer smooth transition towards inflation target whereby would wait factor restrict efficiency monetary policy would weaken. in early 2002 follow achievement relative stability financial market 2001 crisis, bank announce new monetary policy regime public statement implicit inflation targeting. a emphasize historical statement, final aim adopt full-fledged inflation target regime, precondition met. this ‘new’ regime define inflation target since central bank announce numeric target annual inflation jointly set government accord law price stability primary objective. furthermore, similar inflation target sense decision make process shape forward look manner exploit broad set information available. however, inflation target regime also “implicit” rather “full-fledged”, reflect fact precondition strong fiscal position government stability financial market yet fulfilled. during last four years, sound monetary fiscal policy together structural reforms, change institutional framework adaptation economy float exchange rates, however painful might been, result remarkable achievement way price stability. during period, monetary policy central bank put great great emphasis ensure credibility inflation targets. to end, central bank often publicly stress importance continue tight fiscal policy complete structural reform without delay compromise. a result, inflation target reach four year row, significantly enhance credibility monetary policy. i glad able say today inflation low level thirty-seven years. annual cpi inflation, 73.2 percent recently january 2002, single digit figures; stand 7.72 percent end 2005. this performance disinflation obviously positively affect economy. first all, economic growth rate positive last four years. not positive, high level attained. total growth real term since 2001 31 percent. furthermore pattern economic growth changed. today, main source growth improvement productivity increase export performance. in addition this, role private sector economic growth increase considerably last years. recent turkish experience show tight prudent fiscal policy necessarily contractionary, especially economy face fiscal dominance. the economy expect keep grow trend 2006 onward aim obviously achieve sustainable growth rate high levels. 2 bi review 19/2006 secondly, substantial progress financial stability achieve help restructure bank sector. financial market deep much le fragile. parallel achievements, nominal real interest rate decline significantly. the average maturity treasury issue increase considerably turkish eurobond spreads, use proxy country risk premium, drop significantly since 2001. volatility exchange rate gradually decrease thank transparent consistent operation float exchange rate regime. all together trigger reverse-dollarization process: though process interrupt time time progress necessary, weight turkish lira denominate investment portfolio preference upward path. and finally, integration turkish economy world increased, lead competitive environment real sector. this process together macroeconomic stability make possible sustain large current account deficits. moreover, quality finance improve considerably composition capital account change favor long term capital inflow foreign direct investment. at point, i would like reemphasize support fiscal policy important factor contribute achievement. the involvement government process first come fact inflation target set jointly government central bank. the government’s pricing, tax income policy carry tandem inflation targets. another crucial factor fiscal discipline: very high level primary surplus maintain years. thus concern sustainability public debt stock fade away, help inflation expectation consistent targets, maintain confidence economy thus reduce risk premium. the continuity fiscal discipline tight fiscal policy consistent target critical credibility inflation-targeting regime. thus, support fiscal side still indispensable part economic program. dear guests, central bank independence generally imply ability act free direct political pressure take implement decision concern monetary policy. parallel this, central bank independence take first place monetary policy debate especially develop country lack sustain fiscal discipline high inflation rate common. both country experience economic literature prove direct relationship central bank independence inflation. that is, independent thus insulate political pressure central bank is, good country perform term reduce inflation level. the first thing independence central bank evoke de jure independence. within context, factor goal independence, instrument independence, rule appointment, term office discharge high level officers, central banks’ control budget provision staff among important issue address central banks’ law. in fact, i find particularly critical base experience independence concept simply achieve legal independence. i believe achieve central bank independence process live daily basis closely relate central bankers’ stand economic policy stability. the new law central bank, enact may 2001 line eu norm central bank practice world, important step strengthen central bank’s operational independence. by law, i mention before, main objective bank state achieve maintain price stability. furthermore, bank body responsible conduct monetary policy. in addition, credit extend treasury public institution illegal bank shall purchase debt instrument issue treasury public establishment institution primary market. amendment central bank law constitute important institutional step take way european union. all mean bank determine monetary policy policy instrument use discretion. a natural consequence discretion, bank also require establish high possible level accountability transparency. accord law, year april october governor appear council minister explain monetary policy operations. we also make presentation parliament twice year. similarly, central bank give utmost importance transparency. bi review 19/2006 3 evidently, transparency accountability cannot consider separately communication policy. good communication appear unquestionable condition effectiveness monetary policy. only way, central bank manage correctly understand economic agent shape expectation way desires. besides, good communication play important role reduce uncertainty enhance confidence render central bank’s policy understandable predictable. the insulation public communication political pressure constitute one important aspect good communication. in context, central bank’s inform public economic situation risks, use various communication channels, must view significant part independence. in last four years, central bank experience historical transformation term communication policy. it start carry new organizational arrangement within bank, found separate department. this department responsibility prepare document booklets, organize meet conference explain monetary policy well improve information set provide web page bank. what achieve next elucidate newly establish conceptual framework monetary policy. to aim, try explain public concept ‘inflation targeting’, ‘price stability’, ‘floating exchange rate regime’, ‘good governance’, ‘sustainable growth’, standard element textbook generally know academic circles. to make economic agent familiar concepts, communication policy central bank effectively use every occasion lecture speech across country. now, know concept much good understand public. i truly believe good communication play important role performance central bank bring inflation. dear guests, two important development possible effect economy make u decide year 2005 transition period adopt full-fledged inflation target regime 2006. first: a january 1, 2005 drop six zero turkish lira. thiswas important development economy whole. second: the turkish statistical institution announce change calculation methodology price index include cpi, start january 2005. during 2005, addition two developments, step take order improve condition start full-fledged inflation target regime. we continue develop decision-making process towards transparent efficient policymaking. so, though monetary policy committee continue advisory body make policy decisions, begin meet regularly pre-announced day discus development inflation economy 2005. decision short-term interest rate central bank make public follow business day take evaluation meet account. follow announcement policy decisions, report inflation outlook, would include reason decision view committee member together signal decision interest rate would evolve future, make public. another step reorganization research department fit need policy design analysis full fledge inflation target regime. besides, information set use forecast future inflation enlarged; forecast model inflation improve sophisticated. now, let proceed key element full-fledged inflation target regime become effective 2006. we decide target consumer price index (cpi). it indicator easily follow economic agent effective way accurately measure cost daily life. however, also announce cpi affect easily several disturbance control monetary policy, several core inflation indicator also monitor closely. we set inflation target “point target” time, set three-year time horizon year-end targets. the year-end target 2006, 2007 2008 5 percent, 4 percent 4 percent, respectively. bear mind transition 2006 onwards three-year government 4 bi review 19/2006 budget practice, announcement three-year target path expect increase internal consistency inflation target harmony macroeconomic projections. we define plus minus two-percentage point around target uncertainty interval. we think measure comprehensive index cpi one side data model uncertainty economy side, possible central bank turkey ensure inflation deviate le point targets. and, accord 42nd article central bank law, accountable communicate government public inflation deviate two percentage point side: “the bank shall submit information government write inform public disclose reason incapability achieve determine target due time publish occurrence possibility achieve measure take thereof.” unlike last four years, central bank ass upward downward deviation target equal balance. this also mean explanation make public substantial upward downward deviation inflation target. indeed, look countries’ experiences, economy already maintain price stability, consider poor policy management inflation remain systematically target. however, country aim bring inflation high levels, remain target time regard positive signal commitment price stability economic agents. in fact, last four year turkish economy, keep year-end inflation figure target play important role building-up credibility government central bank turkey, consider thirty year high inflation. regard change decision-making process, important note monetary policy committee assume “decision-maker” role instead “advisory” role. decision regard short-term interest rate subject vote monetary policy committee meet 2006. furthermore, line principle transparency, meet date committee announce year advance arrange take account data flow schedule month. another important development “inflation report” main communication instrument monetary policy. the significant change report inclusion inflation forecast central bank. moreover, report also contain signal likely policy change future along general evaluation factor influence inflation in-depth discussion general macroeconomic developments. along inflation report, summary committee meet also important tool communication policy. distinguish guests, a final words, i would like mention inflation target regime end term monetary policy, contrary, component uninterrupted “evolution” process. so far, try strengthen economy help fiscal discipline ongoing structural reforms. i believe independence central bank enhance transparency accountability main tool cope challenge previous period. i want conclude repeat warm welcome all. i hope enjoy conference stay istanbul. thank much. bi review 19/2006 5 krzysztof rybinski: globalisation - opportunities, threat implication economic policy speech mr krzysztof rybinski, deputy president national bank poland, meet entrepreneur participate economic climate survey carry national bank poland, rzeszow, 10 march 2006. * * * lady gentlemen, welcome meet regional branch national bank poland rzeszow. first all, i would like thank much management branch effort organise meeting. since 1998 national bank poland carry quarterly annual economic climate survey enterprises. result survey allow good assessment state economy outlook inflation. they also constitute vital element economic analysis carry nbp. therefore, i would like thank contribution accumulation knowledge nbp current process polish economy. such knowledge, gain people create jobs, make investment face domestic foreign competition daily basis, particularly important environment change structure economy. structural change may bias result derive econometric model use central banks. still student faculty mathematics computer science warsaw university, back late 1980s, i assist work model polish economy carry faculty economic sciences. soon afterwards, result fundamental change structure polish economy, consist liberalisation price open foreign trade, model become useless tool macroeconomic analysis. nowadays, change observe polish economy neither rapid radical more. however, intensification change global economy, report recent years, must bring many economic relation know far. there many structural change whose force, permanence significance cannot assess ongoing basis use econometric models. in principle, assessment feasible years, - point view pursue effective monetary policy - long period1. this period so-called soft data information, obtain directly entrepreneurs, gain particular significance. there numerous example change take place many countries. in spite fact interest rate many central bank reduce historical low recent year (they bring zero japan level 1% usa time), spite high growth price oil commodities, inflation large world economy still remain low. the federal reserve bank increase interest rate 1% 4.5% past two year market expect rises, level 5.0%, whereas interest rate 10-year u treasury bond fluctuate around 4.5% year now. this phenomenon even receive official name “the greenspan’s puzzle”. the yield curve u inverted, mean interest rate 2-year bond high 10-year bonds; light present knowledge, indicate oncoming recession. meanwhile, accord present forecasts, economic growth rate usa slow slightly 2006 remain close potential gdp. in 2005, current account deficit relation gdp usa exceed 6%, many forecast institution expect deterioration. meanwhile, contrary theory economics says, dollar exchange rate, instead falling, appreciate euro 13% 2005. although u foreign liability exceed asset usd 2.5 trillion, current account income balance u 2005 positive. this lead 1 a present a. blind r. real „understanding greenspan standard”, present feed conference kansa city august 2005.

can radical adjustment imbalance occur - yes, mechanism adjustment consequence global growth be? let u begin presentation main hypothesis explain phenomenon global imbalances. in 2003, three economist present hypothesis informal bretton wood regime reactivated8. the original bretton wood system create wwii consist formal obligation participant country maintain foreign exchange rates, determine gold parity, specific level, acceptable deviation exceed 1 percent. the system cease exist 1971 president nixon take decision usa would long exchange dollar gold accord parity determined. the nature reactivate bretton woods, often call bretton wood 2, well convey motto use author concept: “(…) i make agreement tailor whatever money i pay them, return day loan, i would objection order suit him” (jacques rueff, 1965, dooley et al. (2003)) the hypothesis existence informal breton wood 2 say system establish profitable asian country finance u current account deficit, allow increase export market. thus, support economic development asian country allow create new jobs, particularly important china, - accord various estimate - year 10 20 million job created, due migration rural area cities. in order maintain competitiveness exports, asian country intervene fx market, thus prevent appreciation currencies. they invest purchase dollar american bonds, thus finance u current account deficit. another hypothesis explain mechanism occurrence global imbalance form present federal reserve chairman, ben bernanke9. his major concept large u current account deficit cannot explain solely internal factors. in opinion present feed chairman, external factors, define global save glut, play key role. the hypothesis say substantial surplus save investment asian countries, together structurally high save germany japan, result global save glut cause boom u stock exchange increase property prices, turn result drop household save usa. the bretton wood 2 global save glut hypothesis challenge imf, claim source current account surplus excessively low level investment asian country - except china. thus, accord imf, deal global investment drought10, consider fact five year follow asian crisis 1997-1998, 8 a series

current account deficit optimal14, face expect high future growth rate american economy comparison develop economies. this hypothesis base assumption american increase present consumption finance loans, anticipate high future earn allow pay loans, perfectly correct. finally, paper try prove ... deficit. the above-mentioned article hausmann sturzenegger15 argue existence “dark matter” example approach. in spite many attempt prove u current account deficit fact low believe even desirable, vast majority academic economist many central banker seriously alarm scale global imbalances. many paper write recently show may consequence scenario financial market - view adequate measure undertake economic decision-makers - initiate adjustment process themselves16. if financial market start price high risk premium american debt securities, outflow capital market - even decrease capital inflow - may lead fall bond prices, i.e. sharp increase long-term interest rates, slowdown property market, depreciation dollar and, consequently, stagnation even recession, may observe globally. in order mitigate probability scenario, structural reform implement many countries. the usa substantially reduce budget deficit - via reform pension system - increase household save rate. in eu japan series structural reform accelerate raise flexibility competitiveness labour product market

the role interest rate theory practice – useful concept natural real rate interest monetary policy? text g.l.s. shackle biennial memorial lecture 2006, mr axel a weber, president deutsche bundesbank, st. edmund’s college, cambridge, 9 march 2006. the reference lecture find deutsche bundesbank’s website. * * * 1 introduction it obvious interest rate play key role monetary policy today. on one hand, instrument central bank short-term interest rate. on other, interest rate contain important information current state economy, extent past monetary policy measure already start take effect. put differently, interest rate important input output monetary policy decision – instrument variable well indicator variables. of course, thing ‘the’ interest rate. rather, wide variety them. neglect relevant features, distinguish interest rate least respect time maturity respect whether express nominal real terms. interest rate matter consumption investment decision likely long maturity. moreover, since economic agent ultimately benefit consumption real goods, real rate rather nominal rate mainly interest in. monetary policy directly control nominal short-term rates. however, since – accord expectation theory term structure – longer-term rate depend expect future short-term rates, central bank ability affect influence private agents’ expectations. a similar argument hold real rates. give level nominal rates, real interest rate depend expect future inflation rates. to large extent, depend degree public belief monetary policy able ensure price stability. besides expect short-term interest rate expect inflation, longer-term real rate also depend several type risk premia, example inflation risk. these constitute additional channel monetary policy may influence long-term real rates. thus, monetary policy exert direct effect short-term nominal rate indirect important effect long-term real rates. understand current economic variable – economic activity policy variable – interact expect future variable challenge feature prominently academic discussion monetary policy practice recent years. accordingly, book michael woodford “interest prices”, cite frequently nowadays, characterize practice central bank mainly management expectations. this aspect g.l.s. shackle already well aware, shall see later. have say monetary policy influence variety interest rate clear priori whether certain level rate ‘adequate’ sense represent prudent monetary policy. this bring second point, information content interest rates. infer current monetary policy stance prevail interest rate require sort benchmark. ideally, would reference level – depend current economic condition – particular interest rate could compared, difference two measure loose tight monetary policy is. for benchmark useful monetary policy decision-making process, satisfy certain criteria, include follow three. • first, benchmark rate base sound theoretical foundations. this would allow meaningful interpretation behaviour drive force behind it. • second, difference particular interest rate benchmark rate ideally summary variable reflect overall pressure inflation. if possible, should, least, contain predictive power future inflation. • third, benchmark readily computable observable economic data. ideally, criterion include requirement data available sufficient precision time needed. bi review 18/2006 1 actually, economic variable often claim provide benchmark role: natural real rate interest i focus talk. i start wicksell’s notion natural rate, follow presentation definition role today’s monetary macroeconomics. after that, i focus approach measure natural real rate interest (nri) usefulness practice monetary policy. at end remarks, i try judge whether natural rate able satisfy criterion i listed. 2 wicksell’s concept natural rate interest the concept natural rate interest go back wicksell. he define level real interest rate price tendency move either upward downward. the start point analysis assumption movement price single good must cause mismatch demand supply particular good. accordingly, movement aggregate price level must cause mismatch aggregate demand aggregate supply. wicksell therefore stress theory intend explain overall rate inflation must therefore able explain underlie aggregate demand supply movements. a second important aspect wicksell’s theory relate role money credit. he doubt money growth necessary condition inflation, approach base endogeneity money – words, money exogenous. here, bank system play crucial role: by extend credit firm household determine growth rate money thereby aggregate demand. key understand connection wicksell’s ’cumulative process’. bank set ‘too low’ interest rate trigger high credit demand investor because, give relatively low interest rate costs, high expect return. owe prevail large degree flexibility bank sector, bank satisfy high loan demand, result increase money growth high demand investment goods. this tend increase price level investment good competitive wage investment good sector, cause expenditure overall price level rise. this shackle describe next step wicksell’s cumulative process: “the cost production per physical unit good rise month month, price good per unit rise fast, keep ahead, persist gap per unit invite ever-larger output”.1 the cumulative process strong money creation highly flexible bank system high aggregate price level end bank raise interest rate sufficiently. here, ‘sufficiently’ mean interest rate – set bank – raise level overall demand good equal supply – is, interest rate price remain constant. wicksell refer interest rate level ‘natural rate interest’. shackle certainly right foreword english translation stephen frowen wicksell’s “value, capital rent” 1953 compare contribution economic theory make wicksell’s concept natural rate interest make steam locomotive built-up modern societies.2 but, benefit hindsight, know shackle little pessimistic predict natural rate could become obsolete steam locomotive. modern monetary theory – embody late generation new-keynesian macroeconomic models, example – prof opposite true. it accident michael woodford’s textbook – become sort standard work modern monetary theory – carry title “interest prices” - english translation title wicksell’s book ’geldzins und güterpreise’. 3 the natural rate interest modern macroeconomic theory in order highlight key role natural interest rate concept modern monetary theory, useful recapitulate briefly core structure new-keynesian model form workhorse 1 shackle, (1972),p. 336. 2 shackle (1954). 2 bi review 18/2006 today’s monetary policy analysis.3 basically, model add various form nominal rigidity feature real-business-cycle paradigm base notion dynamically optimise agent world characterise stochastic shocks. one key element assumption rational expectations: agent fully take account specific model world inhabit consequence today’s action future. in particular, bear mind monetary authority likely react macroeconomic developments, this, turn, influence action now. model micro-based paradigm render possible analyse outcome policy change without run lucas critique. moreover, model highlight quantify ability monetary policy influence private sector expectation key proper understand effect monetary policy. base view, i mention practice modern central bank frequently describe being, large extent, management private expectations. this aspect monetary policy already stress shackle 1949 article “the nature interest rates.” describe situation central bank try bring interest rate state [p. 115] “a consensus market opinion swung, word deed monetary authority masters”. the structure basic new-keynesian model easily represent three equation characterise dynamic interest rate, output inflation. the first equation relate supply side, second aggregate demand, third specify monetary policy behaviour. the equation represent aggregate supply capture price-setting behaviour firms, result profit-maximisation obstacle sort nominal price rigidity. owe rigidity, firm take account expect development price next period set price today. in basic form, equation know “new-keynesian phillips curve” express current inflation πt function currently expect inflation next period et(πt+1) current output gap xt:4 πt = β·et(πt+1) + κ· xt. (1) the latter stand amount slack good market define difference actual output natural level, is, production level would prevail hypothetical situation fully flexible prices. the demand equation (’is curve‘) base assumption household optimise whole consumption stream present future. this lead expression relate current output gap currently expect output gap next period et(xt+1) interest rate gap: xt = et(xt+1) – σ -1 ·(it - et(πt+1) – rt*) (2) the natural real rate interest come stage: interest rate gap difference actual ex ante real interest rate - et(πt+1) natural real rate interest rt*. this variable turn key variable design monetary policy class models. within new-keynesian paradigm define one-period equilibrium real rate return would prevail hypothetical equilibrium completely flexible prices, is, absence nominal price rigidities. a evident demand equation situation current expect output flexible-price level accompany actual real interest rate equal natural counterpart thus close interest rate gap. the natural rate interest influence solely real factor productivity growth, movement government expenditure, growth workforce, tax structure, time preference households. a consequence, natural rate constant time mirror dynamic drive forces. accordingly, subject short- long-run fluctuations.5 a absolute level natural real rate, one cannot state high low level per se represent state economy desirable not. it simply reflect drive force 3 see clarida, gali gertler (1999), gali (2003) woodford (2003). 4 the parameter β denote subjective discount rate private households, κ incorporate degree nominal price rigidity σ (in equation (2)) govern households’ intertemporal elasticity substitution. 5 an example dependency natural rate structural change point charles bean recently, see bean (2004). he stress global demographic change would lead low natural rate new steady state also along transition path. bi review 18/2006 3 could, principle, gauge favourable not. for instance, increase natural rate may induce rise productivity growth may also root need finance large social security deficits.6for monetary policy purposes, indicator quality natural rate inflation special interest. to end, matter level actual real interest rate compare natural rate interest. again, illustrate clearly within baseline new-keynesian model. an actual real interest rate natural level – is, negative interest rate gap – imply positive value output gap tend increase inflation. if, instance, expect permanent future increase productivity induce agent expect high income future, try smooth consumption already raise consumption level present. in flexible price equilibrium, natural real interest rate would rise, increase current desire save order equate current consumption level current natural output again. however, actual real interest rate rise sufficiently, negative interest rate gap, increase current output gap – is, stimulate economy much – turn lead inflationary pressure.7interestingly, model current inflation rate express solely sum current expect future interest rate gaps. in sense, sequence interest gap sufficient statistic determinant inflation. this close story tell wicksell. indeed, may interpret forward-looking variant wicksellian analysis outline above.8 however, point new-keynesian paradigm also differ wicksell’s theory one crucial aspect: wicksell view inflation disequilibrium phenomenon, inflation new-keynesian model equilibrium phenomenon. in latter case, market clear period variable consistent optimality condition forward-looking household firms. 4 monetary policy natural rate interest theory since trade-off output inflation stabilisation theoretical model present far, prescription stability-oriented monetary policy straightforward: measure currently prevail natural real rate interest, equate one-period interest rate – monetary policy instrument – number. if inflation rate different zero view desirable, result interest rate simply increase amount. for expositional clarity, i assume zero inflation objective follow theoretical remarks.9 the key role natural rate play regard inflation process describe basic new-keynesian model thus render monetary policy simple task: although variety real shock influence inflation, central bank care movement natural rate shock channelled. however, benchmark new-keynesian model, too, describe policy would problem merely consistent equilibrium outcome price stability necessarily create it. the problem permit occurrence le desirable equilibrium fluctuate inflation output gaps. this monetary policy must also commit react sufficiently strongly endogenous variable deviation output gap inflation target values. thus – assume zero inflation objective – monetary policy reaction function theoretical model would set short-term interest rate = rt* + g1· xt + g2·πt, (3) rt* denote natural real rate interest. if monetary policy authority credibly commit follow natural rate react unfavourable situations, situation never occur all. thus, follow rule support equilibrium full stabilisation pin possible one. we note simple taylor rule form 6 see ecb (2004). 7 see amato92005). 8 see woodford (2003) p. 279. 9 for analysis monetary policy simple model without cost-push shocks, see gali (2002). 4 bi review 18/2006 = c + g1· xt + g2 ·πt, (4) follow variation natural rate interest would generally able generate full stabilisation. to illustrate this, assume moment monetary policy nevertheless commit (4) time completely stabilize output inflation. in case, nominal interest rate expect inflation would constant time. however, since natural real rate interest move due exogenous factors, result interest rate gap varies. but accord demand equation (2) would incompatible assume complete stabilisation output gap. this line reason show simple policy rule (4) capable implement complete stabilisation unless natural rate constant. unlike simple model consider far, monetary policy general able guarantee full stabilisation times. one important factor generate trade-off output inflation stabilisation presence cost-push shocks. these appear additional disturbance term phillips curve, πt = β· et(πt+1) + κ· xt + et. (1a) thus, cost-push shock constitute additional drive force inflation beyond effect operate via output gap. the presence shock arise time-varying market power firms, time-varying distortionary consumption wage taxation, time-varying wage-mark-ups imperfectly competitive labour markets.10 in contrast early example, inflationary pressure due real shock – manifest movement natural rate – central bank face trade-off output-gap inflation stabilisation. if cost push shock arises, monetary authority may raise interest rate counterbalance effect inflation. this, however, come cost generate negative output gap. in case, weight central bank attache target come play. in theory, typically represent loss function increase square deviation output level inflation target.11the policymaker seek minimize loss function, take function economy constraint. in presence cost-push shocks, immediately evident – contrary model without cost-push shock – vanish interest rate gap imply price stability. what optimal policy look like case depends, particular, whether policymaker credibly commit future action – language “time inconsistency” literature – whether monetary policy conduct discretion commitment. in case, give existence cost-push shocks, policy merely trace path natural rate optimal. rather, optimal policy take account both: movement natural rate nature additional cost-push shock manifest natural rate. 5 monetary policy natural rate interest practice in light discuss theoretical considerations, natural rate interest could principle play important role conduct monetary policy. and least conceptually measurement would straightforward: identify real drive forces, get know way nri affect them, finally measure values. obviously, three step imply considerable obstacles. step one require exhaustive enumeration real factor potentially important. step two require precise knowledge factor affect real rate, thus require sort exact economic model. finally, step three require measurement variable partly unobservable, time discount rate private households. therefore, natural rate estimate indirectly base current past observation directly observable economic data, make use le detail model prescribe interaction nri variables. however, policymakers intend make use natural rate even le comfortable position econometrician conduct ex post analysis estimate nri give point 10 see benigno woodford (2004), walsh (2003) woodford (2003). 11 more elaborate optimise model base utility-maximising agent even allow choose loss function represent utility stream private agents, turn make meaningful welfare analysis different policy possible. bi review 18/2006 5 history. econometrician use current, past, future observation make inference nri, policymakers past current data disposal. moreover, past current data may also affect data revisions, so-called ‘real-time data problem’ being, itself, significant obstacle monetary policy analysis own. 5.1 estimate natural rate interest for estimate nri, number different method establish literature. unfortunately, lead wide range different results.12 such variability across estimation method pose additional problem besides one uncertainty surround statistical estimate. a shall see below, deal uncertainty appropriate manner real challenge monetary policy – challenge discuss current academic literature debate context policymaking practice. the various approach estimate nri literature group follow three categories: (1) univariate filter approaches, (2) structural econometric model nri latent variable, (3) fully-fledged equilibrium model microeconomic foundations. in follow remarks, i sketch nature method comment advantage drawbacks. one approach estimate nri base simply use realise real rates. the idea support modus operandi, long run – is, shock wash – actual real rate converge natural counterpart. if move average actual real rate take typical length business cycle, result number may interpret close natural rate. since method us actual real rate already inherit arbitrariness measure them: one decide ex ante ex post measure inflation type price index used. additionally, one decide window width sequence mean computed. since choice influence level estimate natural real rate, different variant approach result quite different point estimate nri. the nris result move average estimation typically constitute fairly smooth time series. however, stand contrast characterise feature ‘true’ natural rate outline above, – theoretically - fact exhibit strong variation correspond size dynamic real shock depend on. in general, method base average nature translate de facto abrupt persistent upward change nri smooth phase transition. this drawback remain even average method refined, case, example, method filter low-frequent component real rate.13alternatively, literature also employ econometric model explicitly specify dynamic natural rate exogenous stochastic process. this approach – one hand – base exogenous shock – – assumption certain structural relation observable variable nri.14 these structural equation may contain quite general formulation inflation output dynamic base economic theory. typically, nest variety specification specific theory ad hoc assumptions. for instance, inflation equation may nest forward-looking phillips curve would result particular assumption micro-founded equilibrium model – mention – would also contain lag inflation real activity order take account degree backward-lookingness present data. here, key idea nri – which, nature, unobservable – may filter observable data basis model’s implication interaction nri observable variables. this filter technique efficient two-sided, is, us past current data, also future data. however, since policymakers confine one-sided filtering, real-time problem tend reduce usefulness method. the aforementioned econometric approach specify fairly general structure dynamic key economic variable interact nri. alternatively, one may use specific general equilibrium model economy, usually base explicit microeconomic foundations. 12 see particular survey crespo cuaresma, gnan ritzberger-grünwald (2005). 13 these problem analogous encounter estimate potential output. filter low-frequency component series actual output general lead time series share characteristic theoretical concept potential output. 14 see e.g., laubach williams (2003) mesonnier renne (2004). 6 bi review 18/2006 for euro area, model smets wouters (2003), instance, gain popularity tool monetary policy analysis. such model make possible emulate hypothetical flexible-price path economy, is, sequence equilibrium real variable natural levels. this counterfactual exercise allow u derive natural rate interest. usage estimate equilibrium model also make possible track interpret source variation, shock technology, government spending, change tax system.15moreover, structural equilibrium model direct attention role specific key variable may play identify relative natural rate movements. a outline above, inflation may represent sum future expect natural real interest rates. but immediate proxy expect natural real interest rate even le available current natural real rate. however, exploit logic forward-looking models, important future development may infer observation available real time. for instance, variant new-keynesian model, present andres, lopez-salido nelson (2004), portfolio adjustment cost lead forward-looking specification money demand. this, turn, imply current real balance link current income interest rate also sum expect future value nri interest rate gaps. in words, model true, money contain valuable information future natural real rates. for policymakers, crucial point: give real-time data problem confronted, look monetary development may useful learn current (and future) state economy even new-keynesian world which, first sight, role money offer. and point extent also relate wicksell’s theory, interest rate gap direct implication credit money growth. i come back late issue monetary indicators’ usefulness. however, derive natural rate interest structural model accompany risk underlie narrow view economic interaction may adequate representation reality. base estimate nri distort picture real-world interaction would lead distort estimate nri. obviously, show use concept natural rate interest policymaking come problem model data uncertainty. 5.2 monetary policy guide estimate natural rate interest from forego remark come surprise point estimate natural rate interest vary immensely across methods. again, important note variation across estimation approach prevail addition statistical uncertainty surround every point estimate give model based. for euro area since 1999, synopsis paper crespo cuaresma, gnan, ritzberger-grünwald (2005) show estimate path nri differ considerably term levels, range cover time, smoothness. therefore, natural question arise whether concept nri useful monetary policymakers practice. for illustration, let u consider basic new-keynesian model without output/inflation trade-offs. here, policymakers completely stabilise path inflation output: set nominal interest rate equal natural real rate interest plus inflation objective. they commit react inflation output gap fluctuations, would never occur equilibrium. however, natural rate measure precisely simply replace estimate rule, “estimation error become policy error, stabilization policy become destabilizing”.16one therefore explore optimal monetary policy look like presence measurement uncertainty concern natural rate. this one instance general question monetary policy act presence uncertainty state economy issue currently constitute active research area. under specific assumption apparently comfortable principle ‘certainty equivalence’ prevails: optimal policy react best estimate state variable exactly way react variable precisely observable. it immediately clear even ‘straightforward’ case, every policy come form ‘simple rule’ lose property simplicity: react ‘best estimate’ state variable 15 see also neiss nelson (2001). in dsge model, particularly interest see response nri technology shock depend crucially specification capital adjustment. 16 jonathan a. parker comment orphanides williams (2002). bi review 18/2006 7 usually imply conduct one-sided filter exercise, yield state estimate function current past observables. moreover, approach conditional two crucial requirements: first, central banker know structure data-generating process nri order come best estimate. and second, best estimate typically depend degree mismeasurement nri which, general, precisely know either. thus, try react appropriately state uncertainty, uncertainty kick another level, pose even great challenge. if model uncertainty uncertainty degree mismeasurement prevails, policymakers well advise go strategy robust misconception true economic mechanism degree nri mismeasurement. that is, policy perform acceptably variety possible model structure prefer one optimal one specific environment would lead disastrous outcome another set prevailed. one way tackle issue bayesian approach, policymaker assign subjective probability distribution class possible model prevailing.17 of course, require priori decision set model consider within exercise. note problem closely relate g.l.s shackle’s work uncertainty: come sensible set model – relevant decision affect future – may accomplishable: always „fresh kaleidic shift(s) environment“18, thus, model potentially adequate describe economic characteristic future may imaginable today. model uncertainty sense unknown degree mismeasurement natural rate19 subject orphanides williams (2002): show welfare cost underestimate degree mismeasurement natural rate interest20 exceed cost overestimate it. put differently, policy optimal case low measurement uncertainty would induce large welfare loss measurement uncertainty is, fact, high, would bring moderate loss efficiency converse case. accordingly, robust policy rule put little weight estimate natural rate. in extreme, robust optimal policy would ignore completely go policy rule rely first difference observe variable rather relevant gaps.21 6 sum look ahead this example illustrate top statistical measurement problem question react optimally estimate natural rate may even intricate problem. so end day, make concept natural real rate interest practice monetary policy? to answer question, let come back property ideal benchmark indicator monetary policy stance, i list beginning. first, concern theoretical foundations, natural real rate interest – already long tradition economic theory – play key role modern rational-expectations model monetary macroeconomics stand sound analytical ground. it tool think monetary transmission process. this determinant natural rate interest – example change preferences, advance production technology variation government spend – effect output fluctuation inflation. thus, natural rate interest subsume real shock single number – compare actual real rate – provide indicator stance monetary policy. second, even within limit theoretical framework, correspond interest rate gap sufficient summary variable reflect overall pressure inflation sense capture 17 see angeloni, smets weber (1999) reference therein concern problem monetary policy make uncertainty special reference ecb policy. 18 shackle (1972), p. 240. 19 thus, compare latter considerations, model uncertainty quite narrow sense. 20 they concern natural rate interest natural rate unemployment. 21 orphanides williams even propose policy rule completely dismiss reliance natural rate concepts. see, however, comment j. a. parker claim within non-simple rule estimate natural rate fruitfully exploited. 8 bi review 18/2006 possible determinant price changes. rather, cost-push shock provide source inflation important monetary policymakers know, mirror natural rate interest. third, natural rate interest readily computable observable economic data. on contrary, measurement affect severe problems. in addition usual statistical estimation uncertainty, estimate nris differ widely across estimation approaches. the simplistic approach one follows, farther away one move theoretically found notion nri. this problem le severe detail theoretical model use estimation. in case, however, problem model uncertainty become pivotal. thus, i think one safely conclude natural rate cannot surrogate detail analysis real monetary force relevant identification risk price stability. a seen, even within simple new-keynesian model cost-push shocks, natural real rate interest correspond real interest rate gap alone sufficient measure monetary policy stance. moreover, far certain role natural rate may play model outside new-keynesian paradigm. this point particularly relevant respect model aim capture longer-run perspective monetary development inflation. such model could represent natural complement model short-run fluctuation – new-keynesian type – toolbox policymakers. these essential device judge medium long-term risk price stability. more generally, anchor inflation expectation long run require analysis real side – natural rate consideration take place – complement analysis monetary credit development. this one line reason stand behind two-pillar strategy eurosystem, take account short medium run inflationary pressure within economic analysis well medium long-run risk price stability within monetary analysis. however, i think active research role natural rate monetary policy measurement certainly worthwhile. theoretical consideration along line wicksell’s cumulative process new-keynesian paradigm demonstrate natural rate may key understand factor drive inflation. and since policymakers cannot afford discard information, certainly keep eye it. however, one cannot judge usefulness natural rate interest monetary policy purpose without take account serious problem accompany measurement estimation. a point out, problem severe comprise considerable degree data well model uncertainty. see perspective, may worthwhile examine detail information content real-time estimate natural rate interest various empirical approach – precisely imply real interest rate gap – future inflation. this exercise would move away bite question measure provide estimate close possible ‘true’ natural rate, would move towards question informative empirical measure base natural rate consideration inflation medium run.22 finally, within active theoretical literature optimal monetary policy uncertainty, remain relevant question – imprecise – estimate natural rate interest. conclusion come back title lecture “the role interest rate theory practice - how useful concept natural real rate interest monetary policy?” i would like conclude answer question. i think concept natural rate interest importance modern monetary theory prove useful organise one’s think work economy effect monetary policy. think shackle’s liken wicksell’s natural rate interest steam locomotive i would say modern theoretical version concept indeed high-speed train. however, degree theoretical concept transfer sphere practical monetary policy is, yet, uncertain. 22 neiss nelson (2001) find real interest rate gap base estimate dsge model explanatory power future inflation uk. bi review 18/2006 9 roger w ferguson, jr: international financial report audit remark mr roger w ferguson, jr, vice chairman board

(via videoconference). * * * it pleasure join joint roundtable financial report auditing. a chairman financial stability forum, i would like express appreciation participate roundtable distinguish speaker roles. in addition, i appreciate good partnership international account standard board (iasb) international federation accountant (ifac), host, world bank, prepare gathering. since last joint roundtable october 2004, much transpire international account audit arenas. indeed, 2005 big implementation year international standard around world. the topic roundtable--dealing experience implement iasb ifac standard relate regulatory challenges, international convergence harmonization, issue associate use fair value financial report model, risk vulnerability arise financial report chain--all reflect interconnectedness accounting, auditing, regulation need consider issue unique perspective bring table. it important type constructive dialogue continue take place among many key stakeholder financial report chain. the focus roundtable--international financial report auditing--continues gain increase attention member international regulatory community financial stability forum, international organization security commission (iosco), international association insurance supervisor (iais), basel committee well national supervisors, standard setters, banks, investors, analysts, auditors, many others. a know, recent years, account audit scandal development find way onto front page daily newspaper way rarely see before. these challenge development lead new resolve part governmental, regulatory, business leader must reinforcement improvement standards-setting process return sound accounting, auditing, disclosure practice company auditors. the unprecedented problem year ago fuel effort help restore investor confidence u.s. european capital market legislative reform affect account profession corporate management directors. for example, effort lead to, example, enactment sarbanes-oxley act unite state set stage new audit oversight authority--the public company account oversight board--to regulate, inspect, report on, case enforce penalty auditor lead new requirement corporate management maintain strong internal control make periodic public report adequacy companies' internal controls. in european union, eighth directive initiative undertake recognition important role audit oversight authorities. these initiative seek strengthen account standards, internal controls, transparency. but long legislative initiative considered, step take establish independent international standards-setting framework account audit standards, reflect creation iasb 2001 ifac international audit assurance standard board (or iaasb). both standards-setting process review enhance time continue subject improvements. in keynote speech early today, michel prada share iosco's initiative address international account audit issues. it clear iosco play important role arena many years. likewise, central bank bank supervisor take step enhance focus account audit matter affect institution supervise. during mid-1990s, basel committee start devote resource develop principle would help shape improve bank disclosure, supervisory reporting, account practices. moreover, committee recognize also important support high-quality standards-setting processes. with formation account task force basel committee 1997, bi review 18/2006 1 basel committee begin participate actively process set account audit standards. this participation lead development enhance account guidance financial instrument comprehensive bank audit guidance. the iais also show strong interest development sound international account audit standards, evidence

recognize need strong audit control standard financial service firm companies. the quality management information supervisory financial report dramatically affect internal control systems, include internal audit program review external auditors. sound supervisory financial reporting, good internal controls, quality audit become important financial service regulator directly affect regulators' ability promptly identify institution distress work toward satisfactory resolution. this share understand importance sound audit control practice lead unprecedented level cooperation among international regulatory community--in case, iosco, basel committee, iais, european commission (ec), world bank, financial stability forum, come know monitor group. work together, able develop common position reforms. this common position serve basis dialogue leadership ifac establish credible independent oversight authority help enhance integrity objectivity iaasb's international audit-standards-setting processes. this lead creation new public interest oversight board ifac, busy assume new responsibilities. the public interest oversight board (piob) should, time, lead enhance audit standard practice around world. the financial stability forum please strong supporter initiative, i happy see piob represent roundtable today together leader ifac many monitor group representatives. the financial stability forum take close interest national international effort strengthen confidence financial report frameworks. strong more-convergent national system bring clear financial stability efficiency benefits. the forum's effort include focus global-standards-setting activity iasb account side iaasb audit side. the goal global standard area require high degree convergence u.s. international standards, effort toward full commonality well underway. the forum's interest reflect strong recognition member potential financial stability efficiency benefit significant: high-quality global account standard lead enhance transparency improve market discipline foster stable financial markets. likewise, external audit perform accordance high-quality global audit standard ensure financial statement reliable, transparent, useful marketplace, thus enhance market confidence. i sure want see, time, restoration public confidence quality financial report auditing, i hope dialogue--such take place roundtable--and initiative standard setters, lead standard fully understandable preparers, users, auditors; avoid undue complexity implementation costs; truly contribute 2 bi review 18/2006 transparency. let also stress need continue implement approach improve international account audit standards, also encourage, implementation enforcement standards, enhancement actual international account audit practices. however, like professional undertaking, develop account audit standard practice complicated, gain share understand implication financial report chain financial stability take time. therefore, i please see financial stability forum, iasb, ifac conduct roundtable important financial report audit matter take time contribute exchange valuable information key issues. i hope roundtable continue foster constructive dialogue among many key stakeholder represent type dialogue continue roundtable ended. bi review 18/2006 3 svein gjedrem: the conduct monetary policy comment mr svein gjedrem, governor central bank norway, norge bank watch 2006 report, oslo, 9 march 2006. the chart pdf-format find norge bank’s website. please note text may differ slightly actual presentation. the speech contain reference next inflation report monetary policy meet 16 march. * * * i would like thank cme provide thorough review norge bank’s conduct monetary policy norge bank watch report. i also please invite comment preliminary norge bank watch 2006 report. it extensive report discus number issues. the report discus norge bank’s conduct monetary policy 2005 previous years, also focus aspect interpretation mandate monetary policy. i comment first relationship regulation monetary policy. a last year, report emphasis objective stabilise nominal exchange rate. it point reference exchange rate regulation monetary policy. last year’s recommendation regulation print entirety inflation report reiterated. norge bank’s mandate provide basis conduct monetary policy: “monetary policy shall aim stability norwegian krone’s national international value, contribute stable expectation concern exchange rate developments. at time, monetary policy shall underpin fiscal policy contribute stable development output employment. norge bank responsible implementation monetary policy. norge bank’s implementation monetary policy shall, accordance first paragraph, orient towards low stable inflation. the operational target monetary policy shall annual consumer price inflation approximately 2.5 per cent time. [...]” the responsibility implement monetary policy delegate norge bank pursuant norge bank act appurtenant regulation. the bank set interest rate base interpretation regulation. in interpretation, give weight government’s rationale regulation, purpose express first section, knowledge relationship interest rate, exchange rate, output, employment inflation. the first sentence mandate refer value krone. stability krone’s internal value imply inflation must low stable. low stable inflation contribute economic growth stability financial property markets. the regulation also state monetary policy shall aim stability norwegian krone’s external value, contribute stable expectation concern exchange rate developments. norge bank set specific target level krone exchange rate. with open trade country free capital movements, instrument fine-tune krone exchange rate. the task monetary policy provide nominal anchor. the inflation target anchor. stable inflation expectation contribute stable expectation concern krone, rise public expenditure price internationally trade good also affect economic agents’ expectation krone exchange rate. our interpretation mandate include inflation report. an account also give different developments, include movement exchange rate, affect monetary policy outlook. over time, real exchange rate determine condition monetary policy. the real exchange rate may measure number ways: example, relative consumer price relative labour cost norway trade partners, measure common currency. the real exchange rate fluctuate considerably time deviate substantially bi review 17/2006 1 average level since 1970. nevertheless, tendency real exchange rate revert level. the cost level norwegian economy compare trade partner rise sharply oil age began. since then, level fluctuate certain extent without show clear upward downward tendency. over time, level adjust use petroleum revenues. when subsequently arrive point portion import requirement finance petroleum revenue start diminish, norwegian competitiveness improved. prize-winning research conduct farooq akram (“oil wealth real exchange rates; feer norway”, norge bank work paper 2004/16) show real exchange rate may revert level prevail end 1960s, norway become oil nation. such depreciation achieve either price wage inflation low norway country depreciation nominal exchange rate. the latter would least painful method, flexible exchange rate, also probable. norge bank watch also raise issue monetary policy safeguard objective financial stability. the report emphasis economic literature provide unequivocal recommendation whether done. the report nevertheless express concern regard rise house price credit growth. the report note asset prices, particularly house prices, influence household business save investment decisions, thereby affect real economic developments. monetary policy also influence development inflation, output employment impact asset prices. this description correspond closely understand economy functions. household debt increase sharply since mid-1990s. at time, house price show mark increase. debt development 1990s probably view extent delay adaptation deregulation house credit market 1980s, many household burn finger immediately deregulation. in recent years, household income growth solid, household confidence regard future strong household probably perceive high income level permanent. this may result rise house price debt. in addition, low real interest rate make contribution. in country liberalise credit market long time, denmark example, credit market liberalise hundred year ago, household debt-to-income ratio high countries. norwegian household high level debt, example country household debt even high compare norway trade partners. development growth credit household norway nevertheless give cause concern. we example show subsequent effect period unusually high house price persist long time. at end 1800s, house price rise sharply christiania (now oslo). the effect high level house construction result rise price still perceptible part oslo. at time, house market collapsed. the market new dwell saturated. real house price revert 1899 level mid-1980s. the rise house price high norway recent years, particularly high compare countries. we limit scope restrain structural change occur household increase debt several year invest house property assets. an interest rate would effectively restrain structural adjustment would also adverse impact economic activity. but household vulnerable debt level high. long period sharp rise asset price debt may give rise instability output employment late stage. debt development also affect banks’ behaviour. a particular responsibility monitor development financial institution assign kredittilsynet (financial supervisory authority norway), happy well-equipped supervisory authority field. in forecast economic variables, norge bank us broad approach. current statistic impression norge bank regional network important assess current economic situation. in forecasting, bank us several macroeconomic models: one core model number small models. there is, however, mechanical relationship model bank us forecasts. the bank’s forecast base broad vary range information source include substantial element judgment. 2 bi review 17/2006 important component assessment constitute good interest rate path – stress element judgment assessment – express set criterion met. the criterion include inflation report. criterion set robustness financial stability. it also appropriate ass interest-rate set cross-check simple monetary policy rules. the central balance nevertheless inflation outlook outlook capacity utilisation economy, express chart output gap. the projection inflation report 3/05. if monetary policy anchor inflation target, interest rate must set inflation move towards target. inflation stabilise close target within reasonable time horizon, normally 1-3 years. provide inflation expectation target, inflation gap output gap reasonable proportion close. look ahead, inflation gap output gap normally positive negative time. several recommendation norge bank watch translate weigh outlook two variable other. accord report, norge bank’s inflation projection 2005 fairly accurate. inflation rise somewhat still low, even 2½ year cyclical change. inflation still restrain fall price import consumer goods, increase competition number market current period low nominal pay increases. the trend price consumer good past two three year result favourable development norwegian global economies. low inflation accompany real income growth rise production. it cannot rule small open economy particularly vulnerable fluctuation international prices. deviation inflation target norway broadly line sweden new zealand, large example uk canada. development recent year also influence fairly large favourable disturbance norwegian economy exposed. development norway’s term trade provide illustration here. a consumers, enjoy benefit fall price many import goods. a nation, benefit fall price good import relation price good export. norway’s term trade improving. the impact rise oil gas price particularly strong – domestic economy shield certain extent oil fund mechanism – also terms-of-trade gain mainland economy. the situation norway differ nordic neighbours. it also note figure twelve-month rise consumer price considerably volatile norway countries. we see figure consumer price norway, even tax change energy product excluded, volatile index country product included. low inflation result decline demand, activity employment. in conduct monetary policy, weigh objective stabilise inflation close 2½ per cent time objective stable growth output employment. since inflation low, choose keep interest rate low level time consider even low interest rate. however, norwegian economy show solid growth since summer 2003, decide instead use time bring inflation back target. in period increase cross-border labour flows, substantial technological advances, change competitive condition new trade patterns, may, open economy, accept somewhat great variation inflation deviation target, witness past two three years. bi review 17/2006 3 tiff macklem: renew imf - lesson modern central bank remark mr tiff macklem, deputy governor bank canada, global interdependence center, philadelphia, 9 march 2006. * * * i'm please philadelphia, i'm grateful opportunity speak global interdependence center. your group aim foster dialogue "on challenge opportunity arise increasingly interdependent global civilization." the globalize economy indeed generate tremendous opportunity create wealth raise live standards. but opportunity arisen, challenges. a economy become interconnect trade financial flow truly global marketplace, economic development one location quickly repercussion side globe. in 1997, begin currency devaluation thailand become crisis repercussion asia, country far away russia, brazil, canada. so, challenge face find best way reap economic benefit globalization minimize risk disruption. today, i'd like discus international monetary fund (imf) part meet challenge. the imf create 60 year ago oversee global monetary system era fix exchange rates. but world change dramatically 60 years. most major currency allow float. financial market much larger, much sophisticated, vastly integrate 20 year ago, let alone 1940s. trade expand enormously, major new player enter global trade network. the imf respond new challenge professionalism. it's take new responsibility develop new expertise. yet concern arise fund keep pace change global economy. after 60 years, time take fundamental look role fund global economy. under manage director rodrigo de rato, imf launch strategic review role activities. this opportunity consider kind fund need meet challenge global economy 21st century. but right, must ambitious. i'm also please part "central bank series" speakers, central bank bring valuable perspective discussion. central bank large stake sound international monetary order, thus profound interest imf. and central bank adapt force global economy affect imf: collapse fix exchange rates, expansion private capital flows, evolution financial markets, on. what i propose today discus bank canada central bank evolve response change circumstances. then i'll outline lesson central bank learn distil four key principles. i'll conclude offer think principle could prove useful consider imf future. the principle modern central bank for good reasons, canada return float exchange rate 1970.1 with collapse bretton wood system fix exchange rate shortly thereafter, major industrialize country follow canada's lead. unfortunately, bank canada, like many central banks, take full advantage monetary independence come flexible exchange rate. without anchor fix exchange rate, monetary anchor place, canada, like many countries, suffer effect high inflation 1970s. inflation reduce ability price system allocate economic resource efficiently; save investment decision distorted; economy go boom bust cycles. central banks, include bank canada, struggle problem, bitter experience come search right anchor. we, others, experiment monetary aggregate intermediate targets. but deregulation financial innovation weaken reliability 1 the float exchange rate serve canada's open economy well. canada first adopt float exchange rate 1950. in 1962, return fix regime, since 1970, allow dollar float. bi review 17/2006 1 money measures, relationship money growth inflation prove unstable. by end 1980s, become clear price stability bank canada's pre-eminent objective, aim directly achieve it. in 1991, canada take bold step formalize objective explicit inflation target. our inflation-target objective, establish jointly government canada, aim keep inflation 2 per cent midpoint 1 3 per cent target range. the target prove effective anchor. inflation low stable, we've experience solid growth output employment. canada second major country adopt inflation target. today 20 country targets. in words, there's good deal international experience inflation targeting. a canada, experience positive: inflation targeting, work tandem float exchange rate, generally result low inflation sustain economic growth. step back, look beyond positive results, distinguish four key characteristic credible effective monetary policy framework: clear objective effective tools; legitimacy; effective use markets; transparency accountability. let say word turn. first, clear objective effective tools. the bank canada's monetary policy one clear objective-to keep inflation 2 per cent. and one instrument get job done-the target overnight interest rate. second, legitimacy. the inflation target bank canada's target, also government's. this add legitimacy monetary policy objective, thereby strengthen it. but legitimacy also come experience low inflation good economic outcomes, result broad support among canadian anchor monetary policy low inflation target. third, monetary policy work best market based. we learn valuable lesson 1970s. we learn direct control wage price work beyond short run, introduce myriad distortions, reduce market efficiency. we also learn direct control credit expansion difficult calibrate enforce. they also reduce efficiency financial system allocate resource economy. today, monetary policy implement entirely financial markets. by control overnight interest rate, monetary policy influence interest rate along yield curve, well asset prices. these, turn, influence spending, and, ultimately, inflation. we find transmission monetary policy work effectively central bank implement policy markets, maintain credible policy goal, communicate objective action clearly. this lead naturally fourth characteristic - transparency accountability. one important thing learn inflation target monetary policy work best well understood. the explicit inflation target centrepiece communication monetary policy - help anchor inflation expectations, make easy u explain actions, people judge performance. it provide strong incentive u meet objective accountable. take together, characteristic effective, modern central banking. but i think one go say characteristic useful principle apply broad realm public policy making. let turn topic imf renewal, talk principle apply task hand. principle-based renewal imf the place start clear objective effective tool achieve objectives. the imf's first article agreement state "promote international monetary co-operation permanent institution provide machinery consultation collaboration international monetary problems." in globalized, market economy 21st century, really mean promotion global financial stability support market-based international monetary order. i hope there's broad consensus objective imf. i view challenge face fund best fulfill objective. 2 bi review 17/2006 the main tool surveillance. but surveillance need effective. this mean two things. first, surveillance multilateral, put great emphasis linkage members, spillover one country's policy choice countries, joint risk implies. the reality increasingly globalize economy, understand linkage spillover good be. the fund staff enormously talented group men women. we ensure undertake research analysis need understand change nature global linkages. but understand linkage enough. we need forum risk debate openly, frankly, comprehensively national policy-makers. in turn, imply le emphasis bilateral communication imf give country multilateral discussion among countries, support imf. make surveillance effective also mean strengthen analysis linkage financial sector real economy. in recent years, fund devote considerable energy develop sound standard code assess financial infrastructure member countries. this financial sector surveillance need good integrate imf country reviews. this allow potential risk identify early authority address problems, rather call fund financial assistance midst crisis. achieve integration may require re-thinking fund's internal structure ensure facet work fee effectively surveillance provide sound analysis interaction economic financial development risks, within countries. let turn second key principle - legitimacy. the fund's effectiveness, hence ability promote global financial stability, ultimately give legitimacy credibility. at time, effectiveness depend legitimacy truly global institution, share sense trust responsibility among members. global issue can't effectively address key player feel adequate voice imf members. in respect, clear important aspect fund's governance arrangement keep pace change global economy. in particular, quota vote power fund need good reflect grow power asian emerging-market economies. the issue quota vote power complex persist year come, since asia likely continue grow fast major regions. this suggest need comprehensive solution, work towards end. but also need pragmatic. we need make concrete progress quota issue short term show member serious align representation asian member economic weight. of course, large voice come great responsibility. so let's clear: large stake asian member imply prepare shoulder fair share responsibility promote global financial stability part international monetary order. this bring third principle - effective use markets. a i already highlighted, role fund 21st century promote financial stability support market-based international monetary order. this mean imf must work ensure international financial infrastructure sound, country pursue sustainable policies, incentive encourage appropriate price risk efficient allocation resources. it also mean imf play active role establish "rules game," clear rule support market-based international monetary order. consider exchange rates, example. tim adams, u.s. treasury's under secretary international affairs, recently call imf demonstrate "strong leadership multilateral exchange rate surveillance." specifically, call imf "improve tool advocacy persuade country exit unsustainable exchange regime early on, rather wait perfect circumstance never come." more broadly, i would suggest imf need bring pressure bear national public policy thwart adjustment. delay adjustment make need adjustment go away. it simply increase risk adjustment - come - abrupt disorderly. a highly visible example risk issue "global imbalances," shorthand large u.s. current account deficit mirror large surplus asia and, increasingly, major oil-exporting countries. if imbalance resolve way consistent maximize global growth, significant adjustment required. market lead adjustments, need allow work effectively. this mean let real exchange rate adjust country large current account surpluses, like china; reduce unsustainable fiscal deficit unite states; make labour market flexible europe. the imf play lead role bring right player together, facilitate discussion, rely market achieve necessary adjustments. bi review 17/2006 3 market also play great role crisis resolution. the fund accuse much "exceptional lending." indeed, cases, lend delay need action adjustments. essentially, sovereign borrower creditor wait see fund put new money table. strict implementation exceptional access limit - is, clear rule game fund's activity - would reduce uncertainty associate fund lend create incentive creditor lender negotiate negative economic shock render debt level unsustainable. the fund could facilitate negotiation offer good office promote timely, orderly restructure private claims. the fund's effectiveness capacity depend critically, however, perceive independence. it view disinterested adjudicator also major creditor. the fund reduce uncertainty impede debt restructure provide independent analysis future growth prospect country concerned, advice possible adjustment measures, assessment global economic financial outlook. with information hand, creditor debtor seek market-based solutions. the fourth final characteristic transparency accountability. i say early fund need clear main objective policy framework. the imf must also ensure clear line responsibility within organization support framework. and must transparent reason decisions. in words, fund need governance structure help achieve goal hold individual accountable. currently, decision-making responsibility divide among board governors, executive board directors, manage director staff. but division responsibility among group not, practice, always clearly defined. accountability dispersed, decision-making lack transparency. the imf would effective executive board focus set strategic direction, well ensure policy sound objective met. the manage director would responsible policy implementation, accountable board. this framework would help ensure responsibility policy formulation implementation clear bear appropriately member board manage director, respectively. toward end, bank england governor mervyn king recently suggest establish non-resident executive board meet periodically, rather almost continuously, focus strategic direction oversight. accountability transparency board's decision-making would also enhance frequent timely reporting. finally, importantly, surveillance analysis must be, see be, independent political influence. conclusion i'd like conclude underscore key point. the progress make central bank further economic well-being citizen largely result determine appropriate objective - low stable inflation - determine best achieve transparent accountable fashion. for many central banks, mean inflation targeting. i've suggest lesson international monetary fund. a effective imf really matter. in world float exchange rates, large private capital flows, liberalize trade, need effective forum issue shape global economy discuss candour good will, problem resolved. the imf could forum. but need become legitimate, is, representative international economic community member share responsibility promote common good international financial stability. the imf need operate clear objectives; effective, market-based tool achieve objectives; governance framework support sound decision-making accountability. the need change pressing. a risk associate global imbalance grow importance, imf tested. i much hope significantly effective institution emerge strategic review currently way. if get right, effective imf central maximize benefit globalization. indeed, renewal international monetary fund tremendously important, american canadians, nation increasingly interdependent world. 4 bi review 17/2006 ardian fullani: remittances: an opportunity growth - albanian migration italy case study speech mr ardian fullani, governor bank albania, conference remittances, bari, 4 march 2006. * * * lady gentlemen, i please speak today occasion conference remittances. i would like congratulate world bank puglia region co-organizing esteem international event. i greatly appreciate partnership opportunity explore possible way sustainable growth, formalization high effectiveness remittances. i would like open remark ask simple question. why remittance main topic today? remittance represent direct immediate benefit emigrant family economy. remittance flow develop country estimate twice much development aid country receive. in country like albania, noticeably exceed foreign direct investment. therefore, government nowadays pay attention development strategy remittance flow important financial source boost economic development, especially depress area economic condition force people migrate. a key input policy economic logistic framework behind migration remittance. this conference underlie case-study make great contribution develop efforts. since begin transition, volume remittance albania grow rapidly. indeed, remittance flow increasingly important relative foreign exchange-earning activities, represent around 14 percent gdp, 70 percent exports, 33 percent imports. italy major migration destination country albanians. on hand, albania number one recipient country term remittance flow italy countries. therefore, remittance service italy albania become topic great interest. the italian-albanian remittance corridor relevant case examine effect remittance local community discus way make flow efficient le costly. a recent survey bank albania show remittance positive impact across albanian regions. the influence slightly high le develop region alleviate extent income disparities. remittance become critical source income households, reach 33 percent disposable income average family recipient almost 40 percent rural areas. the recipient remittance social groups, include middle income class (60 percent) well low income class (27 percent). our estimate show level severity poverty significantly reduce among household receive remittances, great influence severity rather level poverty. remittance mostly use import consumer goods, services, purchase construction houses. a small share save invest businesses, mainly agricultural sector. therefore, impact remittance create new job limited. in view, i want downplay importance remittances, draw attention additional structural reform need enhance impact economy. it coincidence reach level 14 percent gdp, growth rate remittance constant foreign direct investment albania. this show mid-term, difference decision foreign investor remitters invest albania. of course, emigrant may good knowledge domestic markets. they connect home-country react fast foreign investors. nevertheless, demand guarantee investment much foreign investor do. therefore, volume remittance effectiveness largely depend improvement albanian business environment. while effort speed reform aim improve business environment underway, especially recent sign stabilization association agreement, question still remains: measure may enhance contribution remittance development? the bank albania cooperation governmental non-governmental institution consider concrete measures, i already highlight bi review 16/2006 1 conference organize ebrd issue last september. i would like briefly mention again, new insights. first, improve knowledge remittance remain critical assessment policies, directly impact develop role remittance economy. the improve information need simply assist policy remittance also financial infrastructure (e.g. reduce transaction costs) understand impact poverty. the bank albania continuously emphasize importance accurate estimation capital inflow form emigrants’ remittances. for good statistic assist imf mission bring methodology define remittance close international standards. also, close cooperation main economic partners, italy greece, main destination albanian emigrants, harmonize methodology order improve estimation accuracy remittances. the report world bank italian-albanian corridor also great contribution improve understand remittances, behalf albanian authority i express gratitude support. second, formalize inflow remittance important moment. more half remittance enter country informal channels. our survey show bulk remittance albania channel unofficial sources; physically bring emigrant (59 percent), friend relative (23 percent). this partially reflection short geographical distance two countries. however, high flow remittance unofficial channel also ask action make official channel attractive term efficiency, safety, cost anonymity. a study team find out, emigrant italy high bank utilization rate – 50 percent bank accounts. on albanian side, figure drop le 20 percent. emigrant families’ access bank suboptimal despite considerable geographical expansion commercial bank recent years. in contrast remittance-receiving countries, bank albania still small market share remittance services. however, encourage sign demand new technologies, innovative partnership entry point reach disadvantage groups. the high fee money transfer apply bank often bring motive individual prefer service. nevertheless, already albanian commercial bank, offer transfer italy albania without charge fee amount 250 euro day, average monthly delivery emigrant usually range 100 150 euros. in meantime, several bank provide service transfer greece. actually, examine possibility low transfer cost broad bilateral agreement two countries. even though, money transfer company provide transfer service reasonable rate good geographical coverage, still observe lot cash enter country bags. i retain, regulatory problem rather preference emigrant go informal. the disparity two country term bank account accessibility largely reflection fact italy cannot get salary provide bank account number. the anti-cash program initiate bank albania clearly indicate order low cash economy, abolish option cash payments, include salary private sector, payment utilities, etc. our bank fully commit support process levels, regulatory technical. of course, come cost, case remittance go zero rate informal cash channel offer positive commission require formal channels. i understand concern raise analyst legislation exchange rate control anti-money launder could increase transfer rate push people go underground. this call revision regulation penalize volume remittances. a i mention earlier, formalization economy major component improve business environment albania. therefore, “forcing” individual get formal channel come short term cost positive rate probably long term benefit signal serious intention move right direction emigrant foreign investors. for recipient families, accessibility financial institution play important role due large percentage receipt deliver straight recipient’s door. in fact, disconnection physical receipt fund location financial institution may great impact disintermediation among recipients. assume receiver exercise control mode location receipt, geographic proximity branch ability pick remittance 2 bi review 16/2006 office (as require western union) determine institution’s ability compete remittance market albania, mention possibility mobilize save new potential clients. remittance point entry many remitters family formal financial system. many emigrant family either familiarize bank limit access financial institutions. the bank albania public communication strategy aim bring public close bank product services, include transfers. no matter small size remittance amounts. even small share leave recipient family bank account could assist economic development fund available bank provide loan product private sector. the concern initially express public administration salaries. now, service provide bank system, see power pool small amounts. for commercial banks, ability market additional value-added services, save products, loan type credit remittance recipients, require achievement critical mass customer acquisition, well high technology delivery mechanism, bring average cost investment require serve client. micro credit program qualitative improvement bank infrastructure, concert introduction new financial instrument also help attract remittances. promote microfinance organization participant remittance market, could offer certain advantage microfinance sector, government remittance recipients. the cost expansion would primarily fall regulatory supervisory authorities. we already take important step bring institution bank albania supervision expect improve status market enhance confidence operate them. microfinance institution already provide small amount loan low income class. their exist program allow leverage network geographic reach assist remittance sender receiver gain access low cost financial services, well access micro-saving investment products. the third area effort channel workers’ remittance toward country’s development needs. the formalization necessary step ensure role remittance develop instrument. it often claim emigrant prefer client banks, since category consider unstable job low level income. first all, perception entirely correct result italian team support fact pool emigrant save become significant enough profitable business. the late italian bank enter market albania (banca italiana di sviluppo) another witness reality. however, i would like see bank operate albania aggressive italian counterpart compete pool save sooner rather later. there also financial service could offer remittance recipients. for instance, link workers’ remittance investment channel remittance flow toward micro-credit loan projects; support migrants’ contribution emigrants’ community development country. a concern signal come survey show emigrant low intention invest either private venture and/or public develop projects. it tell u issue remittance go beyond financial framework. therefore think new way improve incentive emigrant invest back albania, like recent government initiative offer emigrant opportunity return invest country enjoy three year exemption profit personal income taxes. in conclusion, i would add distinctive feature make remittance particularly important instrument economic development relative stability compare private capital financial flows. in contrast financial flow show high volatility 1990s, remittance continue flow much steadily. in term “life cycle” duration individual remittances, theory hold long duration migrant status, low probability large flow remittances. this urge u speed effort exploit potential remittance sooner rather later. their immense role call new way achieve sustainable growth, full formalization high effectiveness remittances. obviously, battle win today. it require lot attention, good will, also complete enforcement strategy. thank you. bi review 16/2006 3 nicholas le pan: basel ii implementation – assess progress date next step remark mr nicholas le pan, superintendent, office superintendent financial institutions, canada; chairman basel accord implementation group; vice chairman basel committee bank supervision, 7th annual global association risk professional 2006, new york, 28 february 2006. * * * let thank garp invite today. there famous actress, might tallulah bankhead, deep voice. her view worry much risks. she said, “whatever happens, happens,” and, “if get go, get go”. well that’s attitude towards risk risk management (or implement basel ii) need. i think “the general”, george patton, whose quote is, “take calculate risks. that quite different rash”. i think general patton say relevant today’s risk management environment also basel ii. let clear – i don’t think regulator basel committee irresponsible “you get go” attitude implement basel ii. hugely important, sometimes forgotten, basel ii good relate capital risk. that key support financial stability key support improve risk management practices. this huge benefit view-for consumer financial services, banks, regulator economies. assess impact one big challenge implement basel ii deal uncertainty impacts. it possible precisely plan impacts, push green start button expect surprises. nor possible adopt basel ii believe lead minimal impact capital every bank. implement basel ii risks. like general patton, want risk understood, don’t want rash. we want protection surprises, want confidence ability react-as banks, regulators-is task. we want static analysis impact reasonable-but get really good feel new system work parallel run period new system running. and fiddle rule change that. and dangerous focus arithmetic-risk management regulation supervision arithmetic high mathematics, neither basel ii. nor focus adjust scale factor mean “getting right”. that floors-protection. that ability work banks, regulate necessary, constrain use certain parameter pillar i. that’s require better, robust job bank take account downturn conditions-something well done, do all, bank quantitative impact assessment provide regulator report publicly. that pillar 2-which country, canada, include target capital level 7/10 (tier i/tier ii) consider well capitalized. we don’t care minimum capital, also care actual capital hold banks. a regulator bank policymakers focus much pillar 1. that country like canada keep leverage test (though indicate review level test make sure wipe benefit individual banks). i gather leverage test bite issue u.s. well! let also remember important role judgment implementation-a theme i return again. consider role judgment assess impacts. a number major bank do estimate simulation basel ii pillar 1 minimum capital move credit cycle, bi review 16/2006 1 recognize are, moment, best credit condition see while. the estimate peak trough variation minimum capital range 15-30% cycle. i encourage bank type analysis. so set minimum capital requirement today exactly equal capital old system then, downturn, minimum requirement might 15 - 20% high current rules–is want? i don’t think so. you can’t get away completely over-the-cycle effects–they inherent system risk based. i would even argue desirable tell market happen riskiness bank cycle. but, mean judgment go require assess impact decide react, overreact, them. but banks’ know cyclicality too. and bank lot incentive smooth path actual capital cycle–fluctuations actual capital along minimum capital likely lead consequence marketplace, raise capital certain time cycle costly, manage bank big change actual capital could quite disruptive. home host issue while go perfect uniformity implementation i believe reasonable degree consistency across major jurisdiction go hugely, hugely important. that’s deal level play field issues, also try make sure investment bank make dissipate multiple duplication inconsistent approach basel ii implemented. the glass half full, also half empty regard sit today. however i take heart fact better-working process place before, include aig (accord implementation group), continue make progress. industry concern home-host implementation issue rising. some arise u decision delay implementation use different floor calculations. there uncertainty u.s. foreign bank treat various jurisdictions. some hopefully alleviate u decision implement basel ii basel 1a issued. there genuine concern re: system costs. there worry potential level play field issue u intend implement basel ii basel 1a relative approach jurisdictions. many major bank group want number subsidiary remain either basel i version basel ii standardise approach close basel i possible, least transitional period. bank concern without approach, system cost implementation materially high force develop “throwaway” system use one two years. the industry sense slow so-called supervisory colleges. aig member generally agree effort slow down, often members’ focus solve home-host issue simply shift bilateral interaction host supervisors. go forward, aig member anticipate acceleration multilateral bilateral work late year approval work intensifies. in case difference across jurisdiction interpretation key provision become apparent. for example, supervisory expectation use test well implementation downturn lgd (loss-given-default) principles. the implementation implication area framework uniformity treatment (e.g. difference definition default) also become apparent. in area like ama (advanced measurement approach) hybrid approach, industry wait supervisory guidance supervisor wait great industry initiative. there also area framework, particularly pillar 2, long clear country approach would differ. the close implementation date, bank worry implication difference term capital. a well, bank supervisor case focus homehost aspect pillar 1 issue application 2 bi review 16/2006 pillar 2 within bank group, degree host-home reliance. these issue come fore. finally, home-host implementation issue case raise issue relate basel ii. some industry concern due residual unrealistic expectation – uniformity implementation strong lead supervisor role, matter much industry would like it. i want emphasise make home-host issue scapegoat. for example, number bank opt adopt much possible simple approach host jurisdictions. some observer claim sign failure home-host cooperation. it essential supervisor policymakers take reason perspective issues. in particular number bank choose simple approach reason focus scarce resource advance approach home country. attribute trend solely home-host regulatory issue unhelpful. where going? i believe short term many large bank group limit range portfolio country close cooperation require implementation advance approach credit operational risk. it important continue move discussion forward. i think time number discussion expand. in case host supervisor need decide simplify version basel ii approach make available foreign bank country ease implementation costs. canada table approach regard aig core principle work group (cpwg) meet information available publicly. a number jurisdiction indicate willingness principle consider type approaches. this willingness need converted, however, practical outcomes. i believe infrastructure enhance home-host cooperation (both bilaterally colleges) approval/validation issue put place. it need use approval accelerate second half year. the aig continue collect information progress share experiences. in addition, communication aig industry frequently ask question implementation issue need enhanced. the aig plan place so. we can’t solve issue cannot discuss fruitfully adoption decision make certain countries. there select area indication flexibility implementation would beneficial. i encourage many supervisor willingness regard. one example case use test could implement flexibly (e.g. strict interpretation use test may appropriate regard either downturn lgds use basel ii analytics provisioning). there area implementation opportunity supervisor share experience “real-time” basis would beneficial achieve consistency. at last meet aig major discussion share information lgd issues. several bank present approach downturn lgds portfolio like mortgage relevant issue. the aig establish monthly “clearinghouse” conference call lgd issues. it allow supervisor share experience regard lgds application considering, identify discus minor lgd implementation issue arise, identify lgd issue group address, share information supervisor tell bank lgd issue supervisor allow bank compute downturn lgds, criterion acceptable downturn methodologies, range outcome lgd certain portfolios. supervisor need decide circumstance go accept ama allocation bank need responsive propose risk base allocation methods. the aigor (operational risk subgroup basel committee accord implementation group) work elaboration home-host information share principle apply operational risk way encourage home-host cooperation continue invite bank present ama approaches, include allocation methods. now what’s go happen bank result call gap year issue different transition periods? some can’t know u.s. actually publish rules. and we’ve certainly encourage u.s. authority clarify much possible, hopefully bi review 16/2006 3 way reduce need foreign bank operate u throw away redo systems. but u.s. authority also helpful clarify gap year floor difference don’t necessarily mean problem foreign bank status u.s. but major foreign bank material operation country go large reduction consolidate capital i’d certainly interest know reason that. i also welcome u.s. authority state willingness help supervisor respect u.s. portfolio foreign banks. now let’s flip way around. there range major u institution would ideally like use advance technique outside u advance able qualify us. aig discussion suggest unlikely acceptable regulator except case material retail portfolio host country modeling, data, analytics risk oversight largely locally. obviously, work require ongoing interaction regulator bank organizations. you can’t mandate cooperation coordination international agreement, especially since mean practice vary case case. a good deal platform enhance cooperation already laid. and talk judgment trust, key reliance. it hugely important regulator bank use feedback mechanism exist relationship identify issue anomalous, promote cooperation, enhance trust reliance. and prepare put significant ongoing effort home host relationship success story implement basel ii. difficult area implementation while many aspect basel ii challenging, several area i know particular focus industry. one downturn lgds. the principle develop implementation important. they sensible practical, make clear bank produce material show default weight long run average lgds enough portfolios. on incremental default risk charge trade book make progress, together security regulators, respond industry suggestion expectation ought bank incorporate capital calculations. do hugely important major contribution deal issue tail risk illiquidity raise recent corrigan report. we produce good material validation issue (with upcoming expectation vendor models). the share experience validation actual interaction bank useful promote consistency. i think intensify year progresses. look forward i would urge focus stress test overall governance. stress test need meaningful hard design well. the result need take account bank management, good exercise judgment. i expect area aig come back to. without formulaic also need recognize basel ii result increase richness information bank’s risk capital find way board directors. importance pillar let’s forget basel ii also market base regulation. it’s fascinate proportion time people spend pillar one. we forget pillar two pillar three little bite peril, collectively. i believe disclosure broadly pretty good shape much bank industry, certain area basel ii go put requirement force place enhance disclosure, that’s hugely important part good judge what’s behind bank organization approach risk what’s behind bank organization approach capital. and i think important counter party perspective i think also important analyst financial community perspective. and challenge bank good relate desire capital good risk, supervisor judge assessment, real. 4 bi review 16/2006 delay issue now call overall delay country order sort thing out. i think miss point, even possible without amend legislation rule number countries. in part real impact basel ii go know certainty actually go live, protection i talk earlier. i respect u.s. decision regard delay. i understand decision, though i wish hadn’t necessary. it certainly make major bank unite state outside unite state worry cross border implementation challenge i understand add worry. in canada, base discussion banks, i believe good proceed drag out. we flexibility deal implementation issue require major bank advance approach u.s. was. we realize fully challenges. but believe major canadian bank make steady progress implementation believe progress consistent international peer issue solvable. implementation plan complex advance approach basel ii pose significant execution risk. i don’t believe challenge unique project size importance. and risk may potentially impact implementation date irb compliance system individual portfolio individual bank canada, believe sufficient flexibility new framework accommodate contingency bank plans, necessary, bank basel ii compliant capital calculation start date. i look initial result qi 5 canada. we’re still process assess impacts. some result big reduction liking, need understand better. some aspect framework include bank calculation downturn condition new trade book rule would raise capital. but i say moment i see highly worrisome result would call question whole framework. i’ve consistently say institution canada year that, want come double digit reduction capital credit risk early years, go heck lot explain do. but remember basel ii risk sensitive, notion minimum capital organization go go down, others might go up, notion i fundamentally embrace. we may important discussions, much, time frame, on. but fundamentally accepted, sign on, world go in. success factor let close success factor people keep mind. basel ii major it project, lot well bank manage major it project risk kind projects. don’t forget pillar two pillar three. don’t forget need ongoing two way communication regulator banks. don’t forget bank role talk host supervisor want cross border implementation go better. more effective relationship home host supervisor success factor. i think we’ve build lot basis enhance relationship help aig we’re go need continue use get serious stage implementation. improve risk measurement management key success factor, i’ve indicate today area i think focus needed. lastly soft things. basel ii increase willingness capability participant make complicate judgments. it increase degree cooperation trust supervisor major bank group. and increase level richness discussion within bank bank supervisor risk capital. i think good things. thank much. bi review 16/2006 5 european central bank: press conference - introductory statement introductory statement mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank, frankfurt main, 2 march 2006. * * * lady gentlemen, let welcome press conference report outcome today’s meet ecb’s govern council. the meet also attend president eurogroup, prime minister juncker, commissioner almunia. at today’s meeting, decide increase key ecb interest rate 25 basis points. this decision reflect upside risk price stability identify basis economic monetary analyses. the adjustment interest rate contribute ensure medium long-term inflation expectation euro area remain solidly anchor level consistent price stability, prerequisite monetary policy make ongoing contribution towards support economic growth job creation euro area. interest rate across entire maturity spectrum still remain low level nominal real terms, monetary policy remain accommodative. while policy stance reflect current assessment, continue monitor closely development respect risk price stability. allow explain assessment great detail, start economic analysis. accord eurostat’s flash estimate, quarter-on-quarter real gdp growth euro area 0.3% fourth quarter 2005. this considerably low strong 0.6% record previous quarter. however, look short-term volatility assess recent economic indicator survey information, evidence suggest economic activity improving. accordingly, see strong growth rate short term, also reflect various indicator-based estimates. look ahead, condition remain place ongoing economic expansion euro area. the external environment remain favourable, provide support euro area exports. investment expect remain strong, benefit extend period favourable finance conditions, corporate balance sheet restructure gain earn business efficiency. consumption growth also strengthen gradually time, line development real disposable income, labour market situation gradually improves. the march ecb staff macroeconomic projection provide additional input analysis prospect economic activity. these projection foresee average annual real gdp growth range 1.7% 2.5% 2006, 1.5% 2.5% 2007. the result constitute slight upward revision eurosystem staff projection december 2005, mainly reflect somewhat strong outlook private investment projection horizon. most recent forecast international organisation private sector institution give broadly similar picture. in view govern council, downside risk outlook growth relate mainly oil price development global imbalances. turn price developments, accord eurostat’s flash estimate, annual hicp inflation 2.3% february 2006, compare 2.4% january. in short run, inflation rate likely remain 2%, precise level depend strongly future energy price developments, recently relatively volatile. beyond short term, change administer price indirect tax expect significantly affect inflation 2006 2007, upward impact also expect indirect effect past oil price increases. at time, wage dynamic euro area remain moderate recent past; work assumption continue case, due least strong global competitive pressures, particularly manufacture sector. moderate wage trend help contain domestic inflationary pressure despite strong oil price increases. therefore, look ahead, crucial social partner continue meet responsibility regard, also context favourable economic environment. further input assessment outlook price development provide march ecb staff projections. annual hicp inflation project lie 1.9% 2.5% 2006, 1.6% 2.8% 2007. compare december 2005 eurosystem staff projections, range imply slight upward revision profile hicp inflation bi review 15/2006 1 come years, reflect mainly increase assumption future oil prices, line market expectations. risk outlook price development remain upside include increase oil prices, strong pass-through oil price rise consumer price currently anticipated, additional increase administer price indirect taxes, – fundamentally – strong wage price development expect due second-round effect past oil price increases. turn monetary analysis, govern council discuss assessment monetary development depth. the annual growth rate m3 remain robust, notwithstanding sign resumption unwind past portfolio shift monetary assets, exert dampen effect headline m3 growth. look short-term effect generate portfolio behaviour, trend rate monetary expansion remain strong, reflect stimulative impact low level interest rates. moreover, annual growth rate credit private sector strengthen recent months, borrow household – especially loan house purchase – non-financial corporation rise mark pace. overall, strong monetary credit growth environment ample liquidity euro area point risk price stability medium long term. to sum up, annual inflation rate project remain elevate 2006 2007, economic analysis indicate risk price stability medium term remain upside. give strength monetary growth ample liquidity situation, cross-check outcome economic analysis monetary analysis confirm upside risk price stability prevail. an adjustment interest rate therefore warranted. by act timely fashion, govern council help keep medium long-term inflation expectation line price stability thereby make ongoing contribution sustainable economic growth job creation. the govern council continue monitor closely development ensure risk price stability materialise. a regard fiscal policies, country plan maintain attain budgetary position close balance surplus horizon stability programmes, progress towards sound public finance euro area whole remain slow. a number country continue report severe imbalances, consolidation effort barely attain minimum require revise stability growth pact, despite improve growth outlook. at time, fiscal cost population age cast shadow long-term fiscal outlook euro area countries. it therefore essential country pursue determine consolidation, introduce concrete effective measure needed. these consolidation effort easily succeed embed comprehensive reform programme adequately prepare long-term fiscal challenges. this enhance credibility revise pact create confidence sound growth-friendly fiscal environment. the broad implication population age also require attention field economic policy. comprehensive structural reform labour product market creation favourable competitive environment firm vital support potential growth raise employment rate demographic effect materialise. complete eu internal market – include market service – key priority. on labour supply side, tax benefit system reform essential provide strong incentive people stay enter labour market. on labour demand side, need promote wage flexibility address labour market rigidities. moreover, good education train important development human capital. the forthcoming meet european council 23-24 march 2006 review progress make lisbon strategy, relaunched last year. we strongly support initiative take european commission european council revive reform process. a full effective realisation necessary reform key long-term economic success european union. we disposal questions. 2 bi review 15/2006 roger w ferguson, jr: economic outlook unite state remark mr roger w ferguson, jr, vice chairman board governor u federal reserve system, howard university economics forum, washington dc, 3 march 2006. * * * i appreciate opportunity speak today macroeconomic outlook u.s. economy. i discus baseline outlook risk outlook. a always, view i express necessarily represent colleague federal reserve. last year was, respects, difficult one american people economy. a recall well, hurricane fall inflict terrible human toll, term number life take dislocation many people. on economic side, storm destroy residential business capital along critical infrastructure also disrupt economic activity, particularly energy petrochemical industry port gulf coast. these effect also contribute sharp increase energy price occur last year. both aftermath storm influence high energy price reflect slow growth real (that is, inflation adjusted) gross domestic product fourth quarter last year. even so, course year whole, real gdp rise bite 3 percent, payroll employment increase significantly, labor productivity post another solid advance, unemployment rate move further. increase overall consumer price boost rise energy prices, increase price apart food energy--that core inflation--remained moderate. in light challenge confront economy, quite favorable outcome. moreover, much slowdown growth last quarter reflect factor unlikely persist. first, i mentioned, hurricane significantly damp economic activity gulf coast region lead sharp increase energy-related imports. although recovery economic activity worst-affected area take long time, many affect industries, include energy sector, make considerable progress toward return production normal levels. second, much weakness consumer spend come sharp drop motor vehicle sale end last summer's employee price programs. third, defense spending, volatile quarter quarter, drop sharply fourth quarter. the unwind factor provide support growth real activity near term. indeed, recent data suggest economic activity 2006 solid start. payroll employment expand briskly january--the late month figure available--on top sizable gain precede two months. although increase contain bounceback effect hurricanes, also likely reflect underlie strength labor demand--an impression corroborate recent low read initial claim unemployment insurance. in addition, underlie pace activity industrial sector quite robust recently. real household spend continue climb january; although unseasonably warm weather month leave imprint data, result suggest underlie strength sector. house activity has, balance, bite soft recently still remain high level. overall, fundamental appear sufficient support continue economic expansion. underlie productivity growth remain strong, financial position household business remain conducive spending, and, run-up oil prices, drag activity high energy price diminish time. and outlook activity abroad quite favorable. in japan, expansion appear broadening, sign suggest japanese financial sector may finally stabilizing. prospect europe gradually improving, particularly germany, several year sluggish growth. many emerge market economy also well, export provide significant boost activity countries. these development provide ongoing support u.s. economy. bi review 15/2006 1 the inflation outlook the continue surge energy price dominant factor affect inflation last year. rise energy price contribute consumer inflation several ways--by boost price gasoline energy goods; raise price non-energy good service firm pas increase energy costs; put upward pressure expectation future inflation. despite pressures, core inflation has, i mentioned, remain contained, result likely attributable range causes. the decline economy's energy intensity one factor restrain pass-through energy price core inflation recent decades. a energy price start rise 1970s, household respond purchase product energy efficient adjust consumption habit ways. business respond design purchase capital good energy efficient redesign production process way use le energy. one measure change energy intensity ratio energy use real gdp, fall half since mid-1970s. econometric evidence suggests, however, pass-through energy price core inflation drop would imply decline energy intensity. in particular, often look forecast equation core inflation include term price energy, weight measure energy intensity. use data year precede 1981, pass-through energy price core price large statistically significant. in period since 1981, evidence pass-through energy price core inflation limited. because energy-price term model already control decline energy intensity, result suggest factor also restrain pass-through energy price core inflation. although many factor could lead results, likely explanation inflation expectation become good anchored. in 1970s, monetary policy unfortunately allow large increase energy price persistent effect inflation, policy undercut fed's credibility cause long-run inflation expectation volatile. since time, however, federal reserve aggressive fight source inflationary pressures, include energy price changes. this effort appear pay low stable inflation also reduction sensitivity long-run inflation expectation energy prices. the reduce sensitivity evidence little movement appear survey measure response rise energy price past two years. this tendency see longer-horizon measure inflation compensation derive comparison yield nominal treasury security treasury inflation-protected security (tips), index measure price change. specifically, period five ten year ahead, tips-based measure inflation compensation remain well anchor recent quarters. moreover, econometric evidence suggest since early 2004, energy price modest effect tips-based inflation compensation relatively long horizons. because inflation-indexed security issue 1970s early 1980s, cannot know sure recent effect differ might operate earlier, i believe difference would stark. all told, increase energy price past couple year probably add 1/2 percentage point core inflation 2005, lag pass-through past increase energy price appear likely add roughly amount year, provide energy price rise significantly further. the term structure interest rate another development receive considerable attention recently term structure interest rates--the yield curve. typically, longer-term interest rate high short-term rates, curve plot yield would rise maturity lengthens. however, since late last fall, yield long maturity equal le short maturities, create flat invert yield curve. go back 1950s, simple picture suggest yield curve tend invert recessions. in addition, academic research, along recent market commentary, suggest shape yield curve strong predictor future economic growth. however, treasury yield curve slightly invert one five year roughly flat beyond that. moreover, yield curve flat invert either short-term 2 bi review 15/2006 interest yield relatively high long-term rate relatively low. historically, flat invert yield curve owe unusually high short-term rate tend follow slowdowns, case episode invert yield curve owe relatively low long-term rates. and, current situation, flatness term structure result largely relatively low long-term yields. in addition, relationship yield curve future economic growth may weaken recent decade decline inflation, dropoff variance economic growth since mid-1980s, financial innovation may alter sensitivity household business change rates. indeed, simple regression model estimate recent data, change slope term structure small effect economic growth model estimate data take long sample period. and model use recent data anticipate rapid real gdp growth come quarter model use long sample period. the relationship yield curve future growth also appear depend factor keep long-term rate low. long-term interest rate embody expectation future interest rate well amount compensation demand investor risk unanticipated movement real interest rate inflation--that is, term premium. by historical standards, term premium appear come significantly recent year quite low. a flat yield curve result low term premium quite different implication future growth would flat yield curve result tight monetary policy. indeed, exogenous decline term premium would make financial condition accommodative would, thing equal, follow high growth. to account developments, estimate term premium add simple regression model relationship real gdp growth slope yield curve. forecast future real gdp growth extend model high model include slope yield curve. and forecast extend model currently close private-sector consensus forecast. thus, reason believe current configuration term structure signal economic downturn. at time, amount economic stimulus arise low long-term rate probably especially large. indeed, low long-term rate may signal relatively low demand capital around world relative saving, turn may reflect lack sufficiently attractive investment opportunities. for example, unite states, nominal share business fix investment gdp rise recently long-run average--a level arguably somewhat low might expect give low level long-term interest rates. because interest rate equilibrate supply demand capital, excess desire save relative desire investment would tend, else equal, hold long-term rates. in turn, low rate stimulate activity area outside business investment: house boost significantly, consumer spend may also receive additional impetus. some risk outlook all told, u.s. economic expansion appear solidly track. nevertheless, outlook real activity face number significant risks, include possibility house price construction could retrench sharply energy price could rise significantly further. house construction significant source strength expansion, consequently, analyst suggest correction sector could take big bite growth. by reading, incoming data suggest house market begin cool somewhat, point sharp falloff. sale new exist home decline recent months, although remain high level; cut though volatility likely relate swing weather, house start appear soften recently. moreover, indicator activity, along anecdotal reports, also seem consistent easing, sharp downward correction. of course, house price may become area vulnerability. house price increase remarkable rate past several years, fundamentally sound reasons, include low mortgage rates. however, possibility remain recent run-up price may great justify fundamental increase house price may moderate undergo sharp adjustment. the late data house prices--including figure release bi review 15/2006 3 week--provide hint moderation house prices, nothing serious, may way. the primary channel deceleration downturn house price would likely affect economy so-called wealth effect. that is, path house price directly affect value house wealth, change wealth influence households' consumption saving. estimate federal reserve board staff's large econometric model various consumption equation suggest wealth effect somewhere neighborhood 3-1/2 cent consumption every dollar change wealth, roughly half effect realize within year. however, estimate uncertain, plausible estimate wealth effect range 2 cent 6 cent every dollar change wealth. moreover, estimate obtain equation look change total wealth, whereas historically, much variation wealth reflect movement equity prices. although effort make isolate effect change different type wealth, difficult get precise estimate wealth effect specifically real estate. and, always possible effect house wealth consumption might change way would hard identify use standard econometric model techniques. for example, effect could, perhaps, increase last decade wave financial innovation make easy le costly household tap accumulate house equity. a decline consumer confidence another channel correction house price could affect economy. in current situation, sizable deceleration house price could outsized effect consumer confidence thereby reduce household spend imply conventional estimate wealth effect. another possible avenue gauge effect house price economy look experience countries. house price rise markedly recent year many industrial country amid low long-term interest rates, ample liquidity, steady economic growth. although movement real house price flatten turn several country first half 2005, since recover part. of country see recent boom house prices, australia experience decline real house price past year; real price 3 percent since peak end 2003. during period, residential investment contracted, growth real consumption slow bit; economy continue grow, part investment sector pick response strong global demand. more country experience slowdown rate increase home price experience outright decline. for example, netherlands--where residential property price rise particularly rapidly late 1990s--the rate increase slow significantly begin 2000. in 2002 2003, economy experience mild recession, domestic demand contract result decline investment (including residential investment) contract consumption. but, even so, economy start recover 2004 2005, house price continue rise recent years. in unite kingdom, house price also flatten last year, deceleration accompany slowdown real consumption growth. more recently, house price start rise again, consumption growth also pick up. the experience australia unite kingdom could take suggest adjustment house price associated, balance, continue modest economic growth, dutch experience paint slightly pessimistic picture. have say that, one difficulty interpret foreign evidence gauge direction causality difficult--that is, adjustment house price cause slowdown real economic growth slowdown activity cause adjustment house prices. on point, recent federal reserve study international experience document pro-cyclicality real house prices: house price tend reach maximum near business cycle peaks, real gdp growth slow first year house price peak.1 1 alan g. ahearne, john ammer, brian m. doyle, linda s. kole, robert f. martin (2005), "house price monetary policy: a cross-country study," international finance discussion paper 2005-841 (washington: board governor federal reserve system, september). 4 bi review 15/2006 give limit know future path house price implication particular house-price scenario real activity, federal reserve continue monitor area closely. further increase energy price another risk economic outlook. the spot price west texas intermediate crude oil rise around $30 per barrel december 2002 around $65 per barrel mid-august 2005, shortly hurricane katrina rita make landfall. since storm hit, price fluctuate widely response development domestic foreign oil market recently stand bite pre-katrina levels. over time period, price far-dated future contract also rise substantial amount. a oil price push high since late 2003, price natural gas also trend sharply. and storm-related disruption natural gas production well weather pattern winter cause considerable volatility natural gas prices. economic theory suggest energy price hike magnitude important contractionary effect economy reduce purchase power household hold business profit outside energy sector. persistently high oil price also likely reduce labor productivity potential output time firm adjust production process use le energy. a reduction aggregate demand, high energy price increase bill import oil natural gas, view "tax" u.s. resident foreign energy producers, thereby hold aggregate demand. give rise energy price since 2003, import "tax" rise $150 billion annually. although imprecise, simulation federal reserve board staff's large-scale econometric model, account effects, suggest increase spot future price energy late 2003 present subtract 1/2 percentage point real gdp growth 2004 1 percentage point 2005. the model suggest subtraction year 1/2 percentage point. in addition effect economic activity, increase energy price also pose risk inflation outlook. look ahead, path far-dated future price oil indicate market expect price rise significantly further. however, give strong global demand energy resource ever-present risk supply disruptions, additional increase energy price cannot rule out. such increase would boost overall inflation rate might put additional upward pressure production cost inflation expectations, turn, could create force would tend push core inflation up. if occur, feed would need particularly vigilant ensure inflation remain control. where go here? a know, federal reserve seek foster price stability promote sustainable growth output, member federal open market committee (fomc) commit achieve objectives. translate general economic objective operational decision monetary policy pose many challenges, simple toolkit economic financial indicator economic model provide reliable guidance times. rather, fomc must ass implication wide range development data well rely best model economics profession provide. in current situation, economic expansion appear track core inflation remain moderate. a i indicated, significant risks, realized, could alter generally sanguine outlook, federal reserve continue monitor development closely. give considerable uncertainty face economy outlook policy, policy decision come month depend heavily implication incoming economic data future growth inflation. bi review 15/2006

montréal métropolitain fédération de chambres de commerce du québec, montréal, quebec, 21 june 2006. * * * since start millennium, development global economy lead important change throughout canadian economy serious challenge many sector regions. because nobody anticipate precisely world unfold, best ensure economy flexible possible. what i want today look briefly canadian economy adjust far talk public policy - include monetary policy - promote economic flexibility. let start list main global development since 2000. first, china india emerge economic powerhouses. second, global economic growth extraordinarily strong. third, go period mark unusually high amount monetary stimulus, central bank process reducing. at time, see persistent grow current account deficit unite states, mirror large grow current account surplus elsewhere, especially asia among many oil-exporting countries. these development significant consequence canadian economy. the strong global growth, especially china, india, unite states, lead sharply high price many primary commodity canada produces. the emergence china india also lead intense competition many manufacturers, well low price various consumer durable semi-durable goods. the high price many exports, couple low price import goods, lead improvement term trade rise income canadian - particularly producer commodities, include metal energy products. in environment, see rapid increase external value canadian dollar. it clear must adjust development ready take advantage opportunity present strong global economy. of course, adjustment easy say done. and important acknowledge adjustment often difficult personal level. the adjustment past three year particularly difficult speed size movement relative prices. this double-edged sword. on one hand, firm face boom demand unable expand quickly enough, hind shortage skilled labour, outdated machinery, inadequate infrastructure. on hand, firm struggle increase value-added good produce canada face fall price global competition. they find way shift activity offshore. this second type difficulty prevalent traditional goods-producing industry clothing, textiles, newsprint. in cases, business owner employee - invest decade life particular firm industry - come term plant closure loss jobs. none easy. these difficulty plain see medium report official economic data. however, data also show increase output sector wholesale trade financial business services, well manufacture sector pharmaceutical transportation equipment. despite challenges, see business across country inventive respond necessity adjustment. we track adjustment regular communication business groups, manufacturers, exporters, well bank's business outlook surveys. these surveys, conduct staff bank's regional offices, available website, i encourage look them. since 2003, canadian dollar begin appreciate, tell encourage story business find way innovate adjust change circumstances. the role public policy but role public policy adjustment process? above all, government try shield business global forces, interfere market signals. which policy bi review 59/2006 1 support market-based adjustment? at macroeconomic level, monetary fiscal policy facilitate adjustment promote stable sustainable long-term economic growth. i'll say role monetary policy moment. on microeconomic side, let mention area government act. the first infrastructure, really two side - human physical. in term human infrastructure, crucial role government promote education training. ultimately, strength economy depend skill workforce. obviously, government make sure everyone opportunity receive sound, basic education. and face shortage skilled labour, public policy encourage train retrain employees, move easily sector expanding. but i would stop there. there much employer give employee opportunity improve develop skills. in term physical infrastructure, public policy support public private investment firm become productive. by infrastructure, i refer traditional project roads, bridges, pipelines, also asset so-called "information superhighway." have modern, reliable infrastructure place allow business invest great certainty, thus further adjustment process. this may mean use private fund develop public infrastructure projects, i mention past speeches. and time encourage type investment, give climate low nominal interest rates, presence large pension fund search kind investment opportunities. the second area government act policy promote economic flexibility. government must see rule regulation hind flexibility. in term labour markets, need recognize support worker mean prop factory industry cannot compete global economy. rather, mean remove barrier worker make adjustment easily painlessly possible. rule regulation prevent worker shift sector sector, province province, even region region within province. too often, labour mobility hind credential recognize one province another. all barrier labour mobility unhelpful, economy, worker themselves. the focus policy must encourage support mobility workforce. third, need policy allow canadian capital market work peak efficiency. this also provide business flexibility help invest expand, support adjustment process. a i say before, need policy impede efficiency financial institution markets, time encourage competition. this crucial, allow firm appropriate access capital, also financial service high value-added industry make large contribution employment income, particularly montréal. those three important microeconomic policy consideration public sector term support economic adjustment. on macroeconomic side, government continue aim sustainable fiscal policies, budget rough balance small surplus. but i want spend minute speak monetary policy role bank canada. the bank canada's monetary policy aim preserve climate low, stable, predictable inflation. this help adjustment process several ways. such climate minimize distortion price signal lead inappropriate investment choices. low stable inflation allow firm undertake long-term investment great certainty. but crucially, low inflation also reduce risk premium demand investors. this mean nominal long-term interest rate keep low, support investment help adjustment process. in addition, bank's monetary policy stabilize function, also facilitate adjustment. let explain. we keep inflation check try economy operate full capacity, aggregate supply demand balance. in so, help adjustment process resource release sector pressure readily absorb sector expanding. we see clear evidence process happen right canada. let say word flexible exchange rate fit monetary policy framework. there call bank smooth fluctuation canadian dollar, slow ascent. but one monetary policy instrument - influence interest rate - one target. canada choose low inflation target, 2 bi review 59/2006 experience clearly show low inflation best contribution monetary policy make economic health. we target canadian dollar. however, mean bank care impact movement exchange rate canadian economy. the truth quite opposite - exchange rate play important role monetary policy deliberations. exchange rate movement tell u something economic development may direct impact demand canadian good services. and movement effect aggregate demand, change relative price shift demand domestic- foreign-produced products. the challenge bank evaluate movements, together data, set course monetary policy work keep demand supply balance inflation low stable. in make evaluation, try determine much particular movement canadian dollar due change world demand good services, much due factor unrelated demand canadian good services. it important understand cause exchange rate movements, implication economy, appropriate monetary policy response, depend cause change. generally speaking, movement relate change demand good service would require little, any, monetary policy response. this impact canadian aggregate demand would serve offset initial direct change global demand good services. and would help keep overall supply demand balance. so say appreciation canadian dollar? since 2003, appreciation - - appear relate improve term trade increase demand canadian good services. some appreciation also reflect broad-based weakness u.s. dollar associate global current account imbalances. my colleague, tiff macklem, speak topic length couple week ago, find remark website. determine much force behind movement currency important, difficult, judgment bank must make. this judgment even difficult time market volatility, see since bank's last fix announcement date 24 may. during time, number canadian economic indicator also published. some indicator strong expected, others weaker. but balance, projection set april monetary policy report appear reasonable. that say, continue expect economic growth roughly line growth potential output, inflation average close 2 per cent target 2007 2008, exclude temporary effect inflation follow forthcoming reduction good service tax. a say last fix announcement date, continue monitor economic financial development global domestic economy relative projection april report. but important remember come set monetary policy, bank always try develop complete picture economy. we react unduly individual piece information. rather, put piece together get underlie trend economy. and, always, look complete economic picture lead next decision date 11 july, present complete picture monetary policy report update two day later. conclusion let conclude. powerful global economic force affect canadian economy continue impact foreseeable future. adjustment must take place. it easy, without pain. and adjustment easy month year ahead. but i'm encourage see firm get job. i encourage persevere adjustments. for part, remain commit keep inflation low, stable, predictable. that best contribution make help output employment remain strong. bi review 59/2006 3 hamad al-sayari: world class bank sector speech his excellency hamad al-sayari, governor saudi arabian monetary agency, “the future building" seminar, cooperation euromoney, riyadh, 9-10 may 2006. * * * lady gentlemen, it great pleasure participate symposium share insight “the development bank sector” saudi arabia glance development role support growth saudi economy dynamic attractive domestic foreign investments. at first, let briefly cover achievement saudi bank sector since establishment sama 1952. accord sama’s charter, two important objective issue strengthen saudi currency stabilize internal external value, regulate commercial banks. on basis historic review, may judge far objective achieved. the exchange rate fluctuate narrow band past six decades. this contribute attain ultimate goal monetary policy achieve price stability. the inflation rate remain low generally remained, average, 1% per annum past 20 years. these stable condition contribute strongly sustain growth overall economy average real gdp growth 3.2% per annum last decade. over decades, economic environment characterize freedom capital flows, open investment climate, low inflation, stable financial system availability ample liquidity. this encourage rise domestic foreign investment country. particularly past two decades, growth rapid non-oil private sector almost double represent 44% annual gdp, percentage contribution oil sector decline around 33%. a sama’s major objective supervise regulate financial system, sama follow prudent policy aim create sound, stable, solid efficient financial system modern payment system. sama’s charter bank control law give broad regulatory power ensure bank adequately capitalized, efficient managements, run fit proper director manager meet competence integrity requirements, bank fit appropriate operation control systems. over long period, prudent supervisory policy timely action ensure bank stay strong solid. this remarkable achievement face global regional economic uncertainties, political crisis, war volatility oil market. today, saudi bank play lead role financial system also include five large specialize government development finance institution leasing, investment insurance company money changers. saudi bank benefit greatly universal bank model permit sama offer range financial service include investment management, mutual funds, brokerage, services. during past decade, volume business saudi bank grow phenomenal rate. in ten year period 1996-2005, banks’ asset grow 213 per cent, deposit 224 per cent capital reserve 248 per cent. during period profit bank system show strong growth return equity average well 20% return asset 2%. the strength saudi bank underline average risk-based capital adequacy, high accord basel capital adequacy standard, average 18% past decade. if review long history foreign investment financial sector since early 1950, number foreign bank grant license open branch kingdom. in 1976, 12 bank kingdom include 10 foreign banks. to saudize bank system benefit foreign expertise bank operate kingdom, government invite foreign bank convert branch saudi-foreign joint stock company equity share 40% foreign partner. technical management agreement also enter manage new bank foreign partners. consequently, saudi bank company establish become integrate global bank system, benefit expertise train capabilities, cop bi review 59/2006 1 developments. eventually, saudi bank compare well counterpart advance countries. during 1990s, new bank license issued. however year 2000 usher new era openness license grant gulf international bank, bahraini bank, own gcc countries. this implement decision make gcc head state permit qualify gcc-owned bank home markets. this follow new license 4 gcc-owned banks, (namely emirate bank international, national bank kuwait, national bank bahrain bank muscat). license also grant five major international emerge market bank (that include bnp paribas, deutsche bank, jp morgan, state bank india national bank pakistan). just past week deutsche bank open branch riyadh national bank kuwait jeddah. the remain bank process open branch 2006. on 27/2/1427h, royal decree issue approve incorporation joint-stock company name "the development bank", capital rls 15.0 billion. this would enhance competition open new horizon diversify bank services. in view importance payment settlement system efficiency security bank system, develop use state-of-the-art electronic technology highly sophisticate technically advance information system meet, often exceed, international standards. the transformation start 1986 sama instal automatic cheque clear system. in 1989, sama require saudi bank join saudi payment network (span) national atm system. this system subsequently extend point-of-sale link customers, merchant banks. however, backbone saudi payment settlement system saudi riyal interbank express (sarie). this interbank system operate real time gross settlement basis. sarie provide electronic link payment clear system instal earlier. a follower statistical data payment systems, issue sama, would realize huge growth achieve number atms, po transaction execute addition transaction carry sarea' system. of course, saudi bank customer benefit greatly advance technology. bank able expand business offer range new products, control cost enhance profitability. consumer benefit access broad range service reduction costs. telephone internet bank rapidly expanding, 2006, saudi payment system well poise enhancement saddad provide ability pay major companies' bill electronically debit account customers. this enhance efficiency reduce costs. currently, sama, cooperation banks, work upgrade streamline saudi payment network permit continue expansion installation atm pos. could provide advance bank service high confidentiality full security. sama also process upgrade cheque clear system carry transaction electronically real time. this meet present future expansion requirement growth capital market promote customer service provide electronic channel way cope large expansion growth domestic economy. during past decade prominent diversification bank business include following: 1. bank able meet increase demand different category customer various modern bank services. this make bank service provide domestic market compete well counterpart develop countries. but past year occur subsequent development lead substantial demand bank service include payment salaries, payment public utility bill fee banks, subscription public offer companies' shares, increase demand share trading, well enforcement security control require measure protect bank system money launder operations. all occur short period, lead rise complaint inefficient service provide bank branches. bank manage still work overcome shortcoming employ train staff, open new branches, provide alternative channel perform bank services, employment rise twelve month 20%. 2. bank make significant stride provision asset management service investment portfolio accounts, mutual investment fund aim domestic, regional 2 bi review 59/2006 international share bond markets, money market instrument real estate investment. asset management increase 8 time rls 17 billion rls 132 billion period 1996-2005. 3. since 1998, consumer loan increase dramatically. this largely attribute sarie system permit loan secure salary assignments. these loan provide access bank system liquidity large segment customer meet consumer investment needs, thereby, support pace economic activity. 4. another important development rapid growth provision islamic shariah compliant service cater increase demand customer services. all saudi bank offer range islamic product include murabaha, mudaraba, musharaka, baie ajel, etc. the significant growth, diversification profitability saudi bank system underpin strong advance regulatory system. over past two decade sama introduce many modern supervisory standard compliant international standard include risk base capital adequacy, liquidity, large exposures, risk management others. in past two year alone, sama develop regulation relate market risk, loan classification provisioning, control consumer lend update requirement appointment senior post banks. on corporate governance front heighten awareness world standard emanate oecd, basle committee others. sama since early 1980s inculcate concept saudi banks. in 1981, issue guidance document director saudi bank define general framework role responsibilities. this follow regulation internal control 1989, prevention fraud (1994), prevention money launder (1995) role audit committee (1996). furthermore, sama promote proper account standard follow saudi bank order ensure transparency financial statements. saudi arabia among first country 1992 adopt international financial report standard bank industry. another important subject relevant bank supervision basle ii capital adequacy accord. sama previously implement first basle capital accord 1992. accordingly, saudi bank maintain high capital adequacy ratio 18% throughout period 1992 2005. also worth note 90% capital tier-1 quality. currently, bank work closely sama implementation basle ii capital accord. we expect bank operate saudi arabia implement standardize approach credit risk 1 january 2008 continue move towards sophisticate internal rat base approaches. for operational risk bank likely move standardize approach one two bank experiment advance management approaches. sama also encourage bank consider national data pool initiative help credit risk management. all saudi bank system well way implementation basel ii expect bank remain highly capitalize new standard. it worth mention sama's approach apply basel (ii) accord integrate one aim raise level risk management order maintain continue strength bank system. one issue preoccupy supervisor bank system security organ combat money launder finance terrorism. over past year number step take including: • in 1990, kingdom ratify un convention illicit traffic narcotic psychotropic substances. • in 1995, sama issue manual contain “guidelines prevention control money launder activities”. these require saudi bank implement “know your customer” rules, maintain record suspicious transaction report suspicious activity law enforcement agency sama. • in 2003, sama issue revise aml-ctf rule update previous requirement provide comprehensive framework kyc requirements, accord 40+8 fatf recommendation basel recommendations. these rule provide strong sanction impose bank individual fail implement requirements. bi review 59/2006 3 • in august 2003, council minister approve law combat money laundering. subsequently, financial intelligence unit create ministry interior staff expert resources. • also 2004, financial action task force carry review implementation 40 plus 8 special recommendations. this review indicate saudi arabia fully largely compliant almost fatf recommendations. • finally, 2005 saudi arabia become member fatf regional body middle east north africa (menafatf) saudi official sama elect appoint executive secretary regional body. finally, another important supervisory development adoption, 2004, risk base supervisory approach sama. this significantly strengthen make efficient on-site off-site supervision practice sama. this approach proactive require enhance frequent communication bank levels. it bring sama supervision fully line new international standards. in recent years, strength saudi bank system sama’s sound bank supervision practice recognize number important international institutions. one find financial sector assessment program imf/wb team 2005 indicate sama bank supervision, fully largely meet 25 basle core principles. on hand, external rat agency include s&p, fitch capital intelligence 2004 2005 issue favourable report saudi bank system. the recent external rat upgrade s&p a+ reflect inherent strength domestic bank system. the development bank sector reflect positively performance saudi economy. over precede three years, gdp (at current prices) increase annual average growth rate 18.1%, private sector gdp 6.7%. money supply grow annual average rate 12.9%, provide adequate liquidity growth requirement economy. look ahead, financial system bank sector benefit state’s effort diversify economy improve investment environment regulatory structural measure take various sectors. a number new law regulatory guideline enact enhance economic growth achieve open domestic markets. the law include foreign investment law, capital market cooperative insurance law new labour law. another important development kingdom's accession wto. turn capital market, contribution growth saudi economy clearly evident. over precede years, market witness remarkable development, role financial intermediary savor investor boosted. it would appropriate indicate recent market correction witness market adverse consequence bank bank system. this sama, supervisory functions, undertake measure necessary safeguard bank customer unfavorable development market. the measure include tighten prudential limit relate lend trade market, issue control consumer loan measure would protect customer bank expansion consumer loan may end trade equity market. consequently, saudi bank manage well first quarter 2006. a share market stabilize continue good performance bank maintained, expect financial system greatly benefit effort authority deepen broaden capital market. now let briefly touch upon opportunity saudi bank medium term. 1. the saudi economy undergo unprecedented boom era base well- develop diversify base cover sector economy, include oil gas, heavy, medium light industries; banking, investment insurance services; transport tourism, within population demographic structure indicate expect growth segment would need bank services. these entire factor make bank financial service market poise grow exponentially, great opportunity bank expand provision conventional service addition expansion area investment banking. bank benefit greatly expertise experience provide advisory service area underwrite cover new ipo’s, corporate finance, finance projects, particularly mega project (in field petroleum gas, petrochemicals, water, electricity, housing, education health), merger acquisitions, 4 bi review 59/2006 security advisory service domestic international brokerage, private wealth management asset management businesses. this may require bank restructure business cope new regulations. it expect financial market broaden deepen, competitive edge bank innovate harness new technologies. the great expansion demand investment service tempt international institution compete domestic bank provision service various economic sectors. 2. shariah compliant bank service record continue phenomenal growth area retail, corporate services, asset management. this area demand drive bank offer new shariah compliant solution response market need benefit boost growth competition. there also room innovate develop adequate product would meet customer various finance investment needs. domestic bank play lead role sector continue maintain leadership role. 3. in view present expect grow demand, commercial residential house finance poise exponential growth. this constitute great opportunity bank develop product provide balance risk rewards, meet customers' needs. this satisfactory development. 4. company’s issuance bond sukuks finance tool yet implement saudi companies. it potential bank company offer issue it. these opportunities, bank also face many challenges. the significant following: 1. attracting, train maintain skilled staff, present future expansion national economy various sectors, particularly, financial sector, generate strong demand financial skill specializations. there also sharp competition exist skills, staff rotation may occur financial institutions. hence, bank financial institution make great effort attract train employee invest generously area. it exaggeration expect number employee financial sector may double next five years. 2. saudi bank face competitive environment domestically region. this open policy kingdom, number bank operate saudi arabia would almost double 20 end 2006. these include best group regional international banks, apart possibility modern technology provide offer cross-border services. the bank also compete, area financial advisory services, non-banking financial institution license capital market authority. these institution compete provide number financial advisory services. 3. in view expect increase demand bank finance number economic project economic sectors, different finance methods, well great development field modern technology, bank require develop method risk management aware new risk include methods. so, qualification capable manage risk minimum level developed. it also important continue comply international standard area supervision accounting. the ability measure manage risk require continue awareness dynamic nature bank business context change market renew risk require development outstanding skills, application secure technology follow advance approach risk assessment. 4. it expect bank face increase demand provision advance bank service product meet requirement era. therefore, work focus creativeness innovation bank cater future need different type customers. high level bake service maintained. there also expansion number branches, atms, telephone bank channels. i wish conclude observation saudi economy currently undergo phase accelerate growth various sector activity unprecedented precede decades. this due great regulatory step take recently state help establish solid base bi review 59/2006 5 sustain growth. what hear recently huge initiative project oil, gas, petrochemical, mining, transport, electricity water sector infrastructure project housing, education, health, would indicate size momentum come economic expansion accompany notable rise per caput income. it expect private sector great role project pace overall activity. thus, financial bank sector enter dynamic excite phase acceleration areas. there new players, new market opportunities, range new product services, significant growth traditional services. the financial sector able fully leverage tradition openness liberalization, large investment technology infrastructure, internal control, development manpower. it enter new era increase consumer participation awareness, great competition, enhance transparency strong supervision corporate governance. the financial sector strong position rise challenge meet demand rapidly grow economy consumer expectation. i emphasize wish expectation saudi financial sector continue leader major player domestic regional economic activity. i thank attention. 6 bi review 59/2006 donald l kohn: the effect globalization inflation implication monetary policy remark mr donald l kohn, member board governor u federal reserve system, federal reserve bank boston's 51st economic conference, chatham, massachusetts, 16 june 2006. * * * thank opportunity participate conference global imbalances, topic grow importance. although i touch global imbalances, i would like focus globalization’s potential influence inflation associate implication monetary policy. it seem natural focus policymaker central bank, and, indeed, several colleague federal open market committee (fomc) also address issue recent months.1 a would see read remarks, consensus yet emerge globalization influence recent inflation developments, part intention today illustrate considerable challenge involve attempt identify extent recent pickup pace global economic integration influence inflation dynamic unite states.2of course, trend toward great international integration product financial market establish quite while; share u.s. economic activity involve international trade (measured nominal export plus import share nominal gross domestic product) rise since early 1970s. however, trend accelerate markedly past fifteen year so. in particular, economy eastern europe become integrate global economy, china, india, east asian market economy emerge important player global trade system. although inflation ultimately monetary phenomenon, seem natural expect, others argued, development would exert downward pressure inflation unite states. the open china india, particular, represent potentially huge increase global supply mainly lower-skilled workers. and clear low cost production emerge economy lead geographic shift

competition abroad. in addition, significant expansion production china elsewhere put substantial upward pressure price oil commodities, many import use input production unite states. indeed, effect globalization domestic inflation need even negative, especially today’s environment strong global growth. one challenge assess effect increase globalization lack research issue. at research conference model inflation hold federal reserve board last fall, none paper even touch issue relate globalization. and, although new interest research emerge place like international monetary fund bank international 1 for example, richard w. fisher (2005), "globalization monetary policy," warren anita marshall lecture american foreign policy, harvard university, november 3; janet l. yellen (2006), "monetary policy global environment," speech deliver the euro dollar globalize economy conference, university california santa cruz, may 27. 2 deb lindner william wascher, board’s staff, contribute remarks. the view express necessarily share colleague board fomc. 3 see, example, international monetary fund (2005), "mexico: staff report 2005 article iv consultation," october 2005; alan g. ahearne, john g. fernald, prakash loungani, john w. schindler (2003), "china emerge asia: comrade competitors?" international finance discussion paper 2003-789 (washington: board governor federal reserve system, december). bi review 59/2006 1 settlements, much work still quite preliminary.4 nevertheless, exist research highlight several channel globalization might help hold domestic inflation recent years. these channel include direct indirect effect domestic inflation low import prices, heighten sensitivity domestic inflation foreign demand condition (and perhaps le sensitivity domestic demand conditions), downward pressure domestic wage growth, upward pressure domestic productivity growth.5 in try clarify think likely magnitude effects, i find useful start point simple reduced-form equation attempt explain movement inflation ask whether statistical relationship embed equation affect globalization. the equation standard one use board elsewhere. it relate core consumer price inflation - using, say, index core personal consumption expenditure (pce) core consumer price index (cpi) - resource utilization, lag inflation, change relative price food energy, change relative import prices. use framework, look effect globalization several ways. first, look influence directly control model - notably influence domestic inflation change import prices. second, look evidence globalization-related structural change model examine stability parameter estimates. third, see whether omit standard model variable might interpret represent change globalization. and, finally, look evidence model error would consistent hypothesis globalization restrain inflation. i focus particular past five year so, which, judge data u.s. trade shares, pace globalization appear pick up. i start import price channel - hypothesis increase globalization depress import price thus domestic inflation. importantly, estimate strength channel capture direct effect import price cost live unite state but, also, least portion indirect effect actual potential import competition price good produce domestically. in reduced-form model i’ve described, effect import price inflation show quite clearly; furthermore, estimate effect appear increase time, increase apparently stem primarily upward trend share import consumer good household spending.6we use model get rough idea relative change import price influence domestic inflation simulate core consumer price would behave relative import price instead remain constant. in particular, increase core import price since mid-1990s average 1-1/2 percentage point le per year increase core consumer prices. accord model simulation, also build associate reduction inflation expectations, direct indirect effect decline relative price import hold core inflation 1/2 1 percentage point per year period, estimate effect substantially large would early decades. however, much decline import price period probably drive movement exchange rate effect technological change good price rather grow integration world markets.7in addition, import price rise average pace core consumer price past several year thus long appear act significant restraint inflation 4 thomas helbling, florence jaumotte, martin sommer (2006), "how ha globalization affect inflation?" imf world economic outlook (washington: imf, april), chapter 3; claudio borio andrew filardo (2006), "globalization inflation: new cross-country evidence global determinant domestic inflation," unpublished paper, bank international settlements, march. 5 ken rogoff also argue globalization increase incentive central bank keep inflation low (kenneth s. rogoff, 2003, "globalization global disinflation," monetary policy uncertainty: adapt change economy," symposium sponsor federal reserve bank kansa city, pp. 77-112.) 6 a standard models, use price measure "core" imports, define import good exclude energy, computers, semiconductors. when change relative import price weight import share, coefficient model fairly stable. 7 research board examine direct effect chinese export global import price mid-1990s 2002 find modest effect u.s. import prices. of course, possible china’s influence import price grow recent year trade share expanded. refer steven b. kamin, mario marazzi, john w. schindler (2004), "is china ‘exporting deflation’?" international finance discussion paper 2004-791 (washington: board governor federal reserve system, january). 2 bi review 59/2006 unite states. this step-up rate change import price obviously reflects, extent, recent movement dollar, especially depreciation 2004. however, also reflect large increase price number import commodities, attribute part rapid expansion activity china asian countries. a second hypothesis increase global capacity hold u.s. inflation recent year limit ability u.s. producer raise price response increase domestic cost production. at basic level, elevate profit margin u.s. producer past year seem inconsistent hypothesis. but raise broad issue determinant inflation - is, whether u.s. inflation le sensitive domestic demand pressure sensitive foreign demand condition earlier. in context inflation model, examine issue two ways. first, look evidence coefficient domestic output unemployment gap fall time. second, add measure foreign excess demand model see whether help explain domestic inflation recent years. with regard first test, find evidence coefficient unemployment gap fall unite states. in particular, coefficient model estimate past twenty year appear one-third low model run forty-year period. of course, globalization potential explanation result, numerous researcher cite persistently low inflation improve credibility monetary policy play important role. in fact, roll regressions, time decline sensitivity inflation unemployment gap appear early associate recent acceleration pace globalization. this aspect globalization hypothesis would bolster decline sensitivity inflation domestic demand accompany increase sensitivity foreign demand. effort find link meet mix results, researcher find large effect others find effect.8 our analysis issue indicate result sensitive foreign output gap define inflation model specified, suggest effect may especially strong. similarly, evidence globalization help restrain unit labor cost recent year mixed. one hypothesis increase supply low-skilled worker associate emergence china east asian country low-cost center production put downward pressure growth nominal wage unite states. however, model change aggregate labor compensation similar structure price-inflation model i describe early detect stable relationship measure globalization (for example, import price change bi estimate foreign output gap) aggregate wage dynamic unite states. that said, recent change some, though all, measure aggregate compensation seem somewhat low model would predicted. of course, several purely domestic factor could help account shortfall, aftereffect unusually sluggish recovery job growth early expansion possible downward drift nonaccelerating-inflation rate unemployment. but also pattern would consistent downward pressure expansion global labor supply. in support link, cross-section study find relationship industry wage growth import penetration, research wage inequality tend relate relative decline wage low-skilled worker trade, although type study effect generally relatively small.9 similarly, research federal reserve bank new york show modest relationship exchange rate fluctuation wage growth, large effect evident wage lower-skilled workers.10 8 borio filardo (2006) gamber hang (2001) find foreign resource utilization sizable effect u.s. inflation, tootell (1998) find little effect. refer borio filardo, "globalization inflation"; edward n. gamber juann h. hang (2001), "has rise globalization reduce u.s. inflation 1990s?" economic inquiry, vol. 39 (january), pp. 58-73; geoffrey m. b. tootell (1998), "globalization u.s. inflation," federal reserve bank boston, new england economic review (july/august), pp. 21-33. 9 see, example, helbling, jaumotte, sommer, "how ha globalization affect inflation?"; william r. cline (1997), trade income distribution (washington: institute international economics). 10 linda goldberg joseph tracy (2003), "exchange rate wages," unpublished paper, federal reserve bank new york. bi review 59/2006 3 a second possibility globalization restrain unit labor cost raise productivity. increase volume trade bolster productivity economy concentrate resource sector relatively efficient. but i see little direct evidence extent globalization may boost aggregate productivity growth unite state recent years. nevertheless, research board find multinational corporations, may great opportunity realize efficiency shift production locations, account disproportionate share aggregate productivity growth late 1990s.11 and microeconomic study find relationship global engagement productivity firm level.12 thus, seem possible persistently high growth rate multifactor productivity recent year may partly due productivity-enhancing effect globalization. in regard, i would note potential shortcoming approach assess effect globalization inflation effect may recent capture adequately data. that is, may soon globalization generate statistically observable change parameter estimate structure standard inflation model. nonetheless, influence globalization inflation substantial many claim, might expect standard model difficulty predict recent inflation trends. for example, recent increase world labor supply restrain domestic unit labor cost significant degree important influence inflation relate globalization difficult quantify context standard model, would expect see sizable model error past several years. again, evidence point limit influence globalization u.s. inflation. if use out-of-sample dynamic simulation model core pce price inflation estimate 1985 end 2001, find that, although model overpredicts inflation past several years, error average 0.1 0.2 percentage point per year, considerably le one might expect give anecdote popular press. in contrast, forecast error model core cpi inflation large (averaging roughly 1/2 1 percentage point per year since mid-2001), perhaps suggestive influence globalization. what i conclude evidence? my assessment that, quite naturally, great integration u.s. economy rapidly evolve world economy affect dynamic inflation determination. unfortunately, huge gap puzzle remain analysis empirical test various hypothesis relate effects. but, part, evidence seem suggest date effect gradual limited: great role direct indirect effect import prices; possibly damp unit labor costs, though le price channel judge high profit margins; potentially small effect domestic output gap great effect foreign output gaps, evidence far conclusive. in particular, entry china, india, others global trade system probably exert modest disinflationary force price unite state recent years. moreover, recognize disinflationary effect could dissipate even reverse come years. they reflect, least part, global imbalance subject conference, rather integration emerging-market economy global trade system. for example, fact china emerging-market economy resist upward pressure exchange rate run trade surplus undoubtedly contribute disinflationary effect rest world. the price export low would market force give great scope foreign exchange markets, supply good service rest world demanding. these imbalance likely sustain indefinitely. the elevate rate national save economy - and, some, relatively restrain rate investment - likely persist face ongoing improvement function financial markets, increase depth product markets, full development economic safety nets. a individual country increasingly draw invest home consume wealth real wage catch past productivity gains, upward pressure currency intensify, demand come good alignment capacity produce, cost advantage 11 carol corrado, paul lengermann, larry slifman (2005), "the contribution mncs u.s. productivity growth,

d. woodward d. nigh, eds., foreign ownership consequence direct investment unite states: beyond u them (westport, conn.: quorum books), pp. 49-68. 4 bi review 59/2006 decline, economy exert less, any, downward pressure inflation unite states. this observation bring final point, monetary policy. clearly, great integration world’s economy leave unite state open influence abroad. in one sense, open economy may forgive shortfall excess demand partly absorb country adjustment import exports. and, extent unite state draw upon world capacity, inflationary effect increase aggregate demand might damp time. but also subject inflationary force abroad, include might accompany shift sustainable pattern global spend production, might emanate rise cost price pressures. moreover, small response inflation domestic demand also imply reduce inflation rise could difficult costly. and, another perspective, integrate financial market exert powerful feedback, may le forgive perceive policy error. for example, financial market participant think fomc dedicate maintain long-run price stability - notion i assure correct - would le will hold dollar-denominated assets, result decline dollar would tend add inflationary pressures. clearly, policymakers need factor decision implication globalization dynamic determination inflation output. in end, however, policymakers abroad cannot lose sight fundamental truth: in world separate currency fluctuate time, country’s central bank determine inflation rate. if fomc allow u.s. economy run beyond sustainable potential time, inflation would eventually rise. and, pickup would become self-perpetuating become embed inflation expectations. thus, good understand implication globalization aid understand inflation dynamics, also clear development relieve central bank responsibility maintain price economic stability. bi review 59/2006 5 stanley fischer: “the paris club fifty” address professor stanley fischer, governor bank israel,

helpful discussions. * * * it pleasure honor take part celebration fiftieth anniversary paris club – former official imf, learn much former chairman paris club i pleasure work five years, governor bank israel. the paris club gift child french tresor. but also many way british institution – i take compliment. it club, voluntary gather interest parties, operate without write constitution, operate case-by-case, display remarkable pragmatism flexibility enable evolve deal enormous variety debt problem year – 400 agreement 80 debtor country $500 billion rescheduled. in perform essential task, stand cause development well past fifty years. and age fifty, face new challenge ensure continue evolve times. i. debt relief like bank international settlements, paris club grow need debt relief – need u long debt existed. in gradually develop flexible set rule grant relief inter-governmental debts, mostly debt develop countries, club make major contribution orderly operation international financial system. the principle conditionality critical. by make conditionality imf, paris club gain least two major benefit international community: operate fund’s skilled professionals, understand design monitor economic program; legitimacy operate within institutional framework creditor debtor members. in turn, put imf center stage develop enforce conditionality, club contribute development fund’s analytic operational approach. there nonetheless major question effectiveness combination conditionality, concessional loans, debt relief. these summarize recognize many country receive conditional debt relief once, receive – again. the underlie question turn difficult many poor country begin grow sustain basis, despite receive aid amount double digit percentage gdp long periods, despite imf world bank programs. i suspect go back participant paris club discussion fifty sixties, would say income level many country whose debt reschedule much low today would imagine pessimistic moments. these concern relate mainly african countries. many african country grow rapidly recently, maybe begin turn corner. the renewal growth help global commodity boom, fact several african country exporter oil. development south africa encouraging, south african growth affect country around it. nigeria make progress, help paris club agreement price oil. but fact remain number people poverty africa increasing, great share world’s poor live africa ever before, aid disease exert devastate effect population many countries. it easy raise question effectiveness conditional debt relief answer them. for problem particularly conditional debt relief, rather question development strategy likely succeed. i go question detail now, beyond say know many necessary condition growth, yet know sufficient conditions. bi review 57/2006 1 over course lifetime, paris club reschedule become increasingly far-reaching. the original approach flow reschedule combine new money last thirty years. in late 1980s brady plan, paris club reschedule begin include relief stock debt. now know first approximation matter present value debt, difference economics flow versus stock reschedulings.1 nonetheless shift flow stock debt reduction major change, part budget account country make stock reduction difficult politically – part doubt principle reduce stock debt breached, one logical rest point process. that rest point cancellation outstanding debts, switch loan grants. that approach accept first g8 creditor nations, several case reluctantly. so long net transfer country need aid rise, grant approach obviously good viewpoint debt sustainability, ceteris paribus. but yet clear net transfer rise approach aid switch loan grants. indeed, main argument new approach may reduce net flow aid country need. it remain see whether case. in discuss loan versus grant sometimes argue – i confess sometimes argue – make loan rather grants, donor encourage great responsibility part recipient government contemplate repay loans. the fact loan often long grace periods, government often short horizons, reduce plausibility argument. i put weight relate argument: many government politically easy make concessional loan rather grants, ida cum paris club approach effect turn loan sort high-risk concessional bond claim recipient country. those believe aid case ineffective would see reduction aid benefit new approach. i continue believe aid target particular needs, include health education, project aid useful support circumstance reasonable, government follow right policies, general budgetary assistance also productive. on balance i believe empirical evidence support view. but little doubt overall record aid process disappointing, case aid failure associate serious government corruption, aid process may contribute government corruption. all issue come fore last decade, increase attention receive help improve record. ii. on creditor side the paris club solve free rider problem seek bring major creditor club, require consensus decision require participant creditor seek good term outside framework, insist debtor give good term creditor. because club require uniformity treatment among different debtor – principle would difficult enshrine write charter – show considerable flexibility ingenuity deal different form creditor will provide relief, invite relevant non-paris club member take part meet needed. of course also mean political consideration visibly play role decide treatment debtor receives, hardly surprise inter-governmental debt considered. for many year paris club protect senior status imf world bank, request debt reduction part. the logic approach quite simple: generally fund bank provide new money. this principle breached, remain see long-term consequence be. but recall country include claim fund part reserves, time hipc debt relief decision, least one major country say would reappraise view. while club able produce acceptable extent comparable concession official creditor operate within framework, increasingly deal issue arise grow 1 in addition, liquidity likely important country without market access 2 bi review 57/2006 role private sector finance develop countries, result grow importance official creditor members, prominent among china. there two issue regard role private sector. the first pace country receive debt relief begin borrow market. so long country imf program, fund able exert – though necessarily decisive – influence rate government borrow private sector. if country exit imf program, leave market internal fiscal discipline control rate borrowing. we need remind recently phase optimism emerge market develop countries, plentiful liquidity, condition could change. at point might discover market internal fiscal discipline may sufficient prevent problem event reduction capital flow develop countries. the second problem arise debt reschedule become necessary. at point coordination equality treatment public private sector lender become difficult, paris club yet arrive fully satisfactory solution. in addition, member private sector argue claim fund bank include restructuring. this demand clear argentine case, private sector participant demand imf also agree debt reduction. the logic claim organization operate emergency lender clear. the issue private-public sector coordination lend debt restructure pose delicate problem official sector, would prefer country eventually finance market – provide sustainable way. the principle debt restructure propose iif, describe detail jacques de larosiere comment afternoon useful themselves, put practice easy individual cases. this evident argentine case, perhaps exceptionally difficult. most recently, paris club become concern country receive debt relief borrow heavily official lenders, member club, notably china. the concern country may take debt wise, event global financial situation changes, future debt restructure much difficult past. the answer concern may well lie wide context, global financial architecture develop world war ii need adapt presence important new players, among particularly bric countries. a new player asia elsewhere begin take responsibility system, system give concern great role, may begin appreciate importance exist institutions, formal informal. and may sure case, ingenuity pragmatism paris club demonstrate first fifty years, continue contribute development international financial system ability deal official sector debt difficulties. thank you. bi review 57/2006 3 shamshad akhtar:

cumulatively outstanding loan institution r 3 billion deposit r 6.6 billion bulk far intermediate pmn members. unlike countries, pakistan lift prohibition limitation participation foreign equity holder (or founder / member case ngos), borrow foreign sources, employment non-citizens management technical positions. this go long way help set business modern line also bring necessary experience technological support industry. while development underway, important recognize challenge beset with. of principal concern low coverage microfinance services. the microfinance institutional framework currently support barely 600,000 active borrowers. exist coverage formal microfinance sector 10% estimate 6 million household need microfinance. the requirement clearly norm currently one fourth population pakistan poverty line. another feature high concentration across institutions, lend among clients. khushhali bank pmn provide bulk service give edge start business early on. but institution

additional feature, mobile bank guideline design facilitate mfbs penetrate target market. sbp issue ngos/rural support programs/cooperative transformation guidelines. fit proper criterion lay ceo

encourage paradigm shift rapidly evolve operate environment microfinance sector. (cid:190) first, need move away subsidization microfinance service commercialization financial services. this, among others, involve look beyond government donor subsidize credit delivery system self sufficient institution provide commercial finance. bank rakyat indonesia (bri) bolivia's fini institution bancosol, leader microfinance revolution, good example among others study mean financially self-sufficient microfinance institution. both bank provide wide outreach low-income clients, encourage commercialization, profitable. bri finance loan portfolio locally mobilize savings; bancosol finance loan savings, commercial debt, for-profit investment. in institutions, relationship sustainability outreach emphasized. (cid:190) move single multiple product key financial social sustainability microfinance industry. there three basic microfinance products: loans, save insurance; loan • mostly short term work capital • large loan fix asset • house save • mostly compulsory save use loan guarantee protection lender. most microcredit operation mfis cannot mobilize deposit without license central bank. member society mobilize save members. • save often appropriate financial product poor credit. this imply work formal financial sector institutions, roscas5 member societies. insurance • loan insurance common. • common way provide loan insurance are: • purchase borrower take loan percentage loan; 4 rs. 150 million. 5 rotate save credit association bi review 57/2006 3 • establish emergency fund village banks, community loan association groups; • compulsory savings. (cid:190) third, financially sustainability microfinance contingent recognize credit price effectively. the administrative cost delivery, disburse collect micro tiny loan portfolio much high comparison conventional loan portfolios. so borrower end pay interest rate substantially high rate bank charge traditional borrowers. accord recent adb study, nominal interest rate charge mfis asia region range 30-70% (on reduce balance) excessively high give inflationary trend relatively low. the key reduce cost introduce market competition, innovation efficiency. further, mfis disclose effective interest rate loan applicant standard guidelines. the mandate discipline disclose effective interest rate may help micro lender focus step take increase efficiency thus low rates. (cid:190) fourth, option enhance access credit low income group augment combination credit bureau statistical risk-scoring techniques. in context pakistan, simple solution involve verification base national identity card (nic) new technology popularly adopt nadra i.e. thumbprint reader retinal scanners. when mfis begin compete customers, over-indebtedness default rise sharply unless access database capture relevant aspect clients’ borrow behavior. (cid:190) fifth, know your customer, educate give voice clients. mfbs/mfis need know customer, know market design product fit financial requirement people serve. the design product base financial

randall s kroszner, member board governor u federal reserve system, bankers' association finance trade, new york, new york, 15 june 2006. * * * today i want talk new excite development bond market around world. the motivation discussion current puzzle situation relatively flat yield curve combine relatively low real nominal long-term interest rates, occur develop economy emerge markets. i explore possible explanation pattern focus change prospect risk long-term inflation outlook, particularly emerging-market economies. in particular, i highlight financial innovation international competitive pressures, combine good public understand cost inflation change institution central banking, help improve credibility central bank inflation outcome many emerge markets. until recently, many emerging-market country simply yield curve effectively market debt issue domestic currency beyond short horizon. the credibility central bank crucial deepen domestic capital market, typically associate high economic growth. i optimistic development continue, i believe move toward low inflation rate reflect important technological institutional factor likely persist. nevertheless, still risks, underscore importance continue reap benefit improve central bank behavior credibility emerge market around world. global development bond market in february 2005, former federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan note puzzle u.s. economy relate slope yield curve level long-term interest rate.1 long-term interest rate remain low stable despite solid economic recovery sustain period monetary policy tighten target federal fund rate go 1 percent 2-1/2 percent. when first publicly note "conundrum," call it, ten-year treasury yield 4 percent. today, despite additional 250 basis point increase target federal fund rate, nominal ten-year treasury yield roughly 5 percent, still low historical standards, compare average 7-1/2 percent since 1980. the combination rise short rate relatively stable long rate lead flat yield curve. during last quarter-century, example, difference yield ten-year treasury note yield three-month treasury bill roughly 1-3/4 percent (or, exact, 179 basis point 1980 present). during last year, difference le 50 basis point currently le half that. thus, essentially flat slope atypical u.s. experience. i sure familiar simple relationship short-term long-term interest rates. the yield ten-year bond, instance, think series consecutive forward rates. if could borrow lend rate u.s. treasury, could lock three-month loan ten year borrow ten year three month simultaneously lend principal ten years. the difference interest pay interest earn transaction determine imply forward rate ten year today.2 the forward rate reflect market expectation future short-term interest rate 1 alan greenspan (2005), statement senate committee banking, housing, urban affairs, present federal reserve board’s "monetary policy report congress," february 16. 2 strictly speaking, calculation require use zero-coupon bonds, approximate use coupon securities. bi review 57/2006 1 also "term premium" compensate risk commit extend credit far future, include risk future inflation.3at point time, then, calculate short-term forward rate ten year ahead base yield curve u.s. treasury coupon securities.4 this "far forward" rate make conundrum even puzzle reach historically low level almost 4-1/4 percent last year, 200 basis point average since 1990, rebound somewhat year. in real terms, far forward rate calculate inflation-indexed security similarly long run average. the u.s. bond market conundrum occur parallel similar development foreign bond markets. in major industrial countries, bond yield trend down, case reach historical low recently. yield also low real terms, measure inflation-indexed bonds. far-forward short rate recent year also reach unusually low level many industrial countries. the interest and, i believe, perhaps least study recent development bond market concern change emerge markets. while well know yield spread dollar-denominated bond emerging-market government include embi+ index near time low (even take account recent rise), two phenomenon emerge market receive le attention. one development market longer-dated fixed-coupon bond issue local currencies. this phenomenon is, perspective, quite remarkable belie assertion "original sins" bad policy past doom development domestic currency bond market many emerge markets. the recent lengthen maturity domestic-currency debt market has, many cases, extend yield curve effectively create local currency yield curve simply exist earlier. since 2000, ten-year nominal fixed-coupon bond local currency introduce brazil, colombia, indonesia, mexico, russia, korea issue ten-year fix coupon bond 1995. to illustrate detail, government mexico korea able extend average maturity local-currency debt significantly past years. the mexican government issue ten-year maturity 2001 20-year maturity 2003. the proportion local-currency debt mexico mature within one year nearly 90 percent 2002 75 percent. (i include float rate debt one-year maturity category.) the korean government continue increase proportion domestic currency debt long maturities, one-year-and-under segment fall roughly one-half 1999 one-quarter end last year. two, bond yield local currency emerging-market country also declined. it perhaps surprise that, give high rate save generally high level economic development, government hong kong korea borrow close industrial-country levels. more notable, however, mexican government borrow peso ten-year maturity rate average roughly 9 percent. and mexico unique regard. other middle-income emerge market ten-year local-currency fix rate bond yield single digit include chile, malaysia, russia, thailand, name few. for country long maturities, imply short-term interest rate five year ahead also decline reach low levels, although increase past months. what drive changes? there number complementary, alternative, explanations. explanation low real bond yield chairman bernanke suggest excess ex ante global save relative global investment, sometimes refer global save glut, hold real interest rate around 3 don h. kim jonathan h. wright (2005), "an arbitrage-free three-factor term structure model recent behavior long-term yield distant-horizon forward rates," finance economics discussion series 2005-33 (washington: board governor federal reserve system, august). 4 typically calculate "instantaneous" forward rate, limit value sequence forward rate maturity decline toward zero. 2 bi review 57/2006 world encourage capital inflow unite states.5 some factor behind save glut include surge revenue oil commodity exporters, reduction fiscal deficit latin american countries, retreat asian investment demand boom precede late 1990s financial crisis save rate stay high asia. the save glut story help explain real component low bond yield well pattern global capital flows, chairman bernanke’s focus. another factor behind decline real yield emerge market improve fiscal situation increase national save also calm fear ability government service debt. however, also nominal aspect low global bond yields. in rest talk, i would like emphasize worldwide decline inflation perceive inflation risk key contributor low nominal bond yields. explanation low nominal bond yield inflation rate major industrial develop region trend past twenty-five years. compare period 1980 1999, median inflation rate 2000 2004 fell 5 percent 2 percent industrialize country 14 percent 4-1/2 percent emerge markets, accord recent statistic international monetary fund. not long ago, annual inflation rate brazil mexico time exceed 100 percent. but past decade, brazilian mexican inflation rate remain low. in particular, inflation brazil spike financial crisis sharp currency depreciation late 1990s. give brazil’s history hyperinflation, stability especially remarkable. brazil experience small spike inflation around presidential election 2002, even minor historical standards. the pattern low inflation see across many countries, large small. a year ago i research show inflation rate around world fall significantly since 1970s 1980s, term average medians.6 indeed, imf’s april 2006 world economic outlook note average inflation rate industrial country develop country recent year low level since least early 1970s. more important, i find bad inflation performer (specifically 10 percent country world experience high inflation) much low inflation rate bad performer 1970s, 1980s, 1990s. thus, bad behavior bad was. do market expect low inflation persist long run? to answer question, look measure expect inflation. consensus economics survey hundred professional forecaster numerous country april. the survey allow u examine forecast inflation around world six ten year ahead begin 1996. the late observation, april 2006, example, forecast give country’s average consumer price inflation rate 2012 2016. for representative sample industrial economy (euro area, japan, unite states, unite kingdom) emerging-market economy (brazil, china, korea, mexico), observe substantial decline late 1990s today. these forecast low stable industrial many important develop country recent years. the survey thus provide one indication market expect low inflation persist. the volatility inflation also decline notably, suggest perceive inflation risk may decline well. for industrial countries, inflation volatility (measured twenty-quarter roll standard deviation consumer price inflation) decline 1980s 1990s period since 2000. although since drift bite due volatility oil prices, remain near low level last quarter-century. for emerge markets, decline volatility even dramatic. brazil, particular, chart much time late 1990s. volatility inflation china, korea, mexico level similar industrial countries, volatility brazil much higher. 5 ben s. bernanke (2005), "the global save glut u.s. current account deficit," sandridge

cambridge university press), pp. 275–99. bi review 57/2006 3 overall, combination low le volatile inflation around world lead reduction inflation expectation low perceive inflation risk, hence low inflation uncertainty premium long rates. i believe factor important contributor low long-term yield flatten yield curves, particularly emerge markets. the existence market long-term nominal government corporate debt powerful evidence faith investor place future environment price stability. factor behind global move price stability four broad factor lie behind move price stability, especially emerge markets, factor tend reinforce other. each factor affect cost-benefit tradeoff pursue high-inflation policy. the first factor, get surprisingly little attention view, financial innovation alter ability incentive government pursue high-inflation policy.7 i put innovation two main categories, development information technology physical dollarization, effectively increase potential competition among currencies. financial innovation make easy citizen move asset local currency government resort inflation tax. the dollarizations follow high-inflation episode latin america former soviet union, example, significantly reduce cost switch away local currency small-value transactions. the specific channel financial innovation could affect competition among currency many: • electronic trade payment technology enable investor bank shift asset quickly away currency prone inflation relate risks. in 1990s, many country - include brazil, korea, mexico - implement real-time gross settlement payment systems, allow market rapidly settle payment obligation finality day. • financial innovation credit card network money market mutual fund allow household firm minimize hold cash central bank reserves, thus shrink base inflation tax. • increase circulation banknote dollar hard currency enable citizen conduct transaction without hold inflationary currency. data publish federal reserve’s website show dramatic increase fraction u.s. federal reserve note estimate hold foreign countries. the fraction u.s. federal reserve note hold abroad rise 20 percent 1980 almost 50 percent late 1990s. give innovations, government pressure central bank pursue inflationary policy get much le benefit unit increase inflation people easily switch local currency. in words, inflation tax become much difficult costly levy citizen easily avoid tax use alternative money. the second closely relate factor behind disinflation deregulation competition globalize marketplace. the collapse centrally-planned economy lead many country turn increasingly private market deliver growth progress reduce role government. technology help increase global competition shrink barrier time distance. again, several channel globalization competition may affect cost-benefit tradeoff purse inflation: • a kenneth rogoff point 2003 jackson hole conference sponsor federal reserve bank kansa city, great competition lead more-flexible prices.8 when price flexible, central bank’s ability temporarily influence output diminish influence inflation enhanced. thus, more-competitive market naturally help central bank achieve price stabilization. 7 i discuss aspect factor presentation may 2001 conference federal reserve bank cleveland, cite above. 8 kenneth s. rogoff (2003), "globalization global disinflation," monetary policy uncertainty: adapt change economy: a symposium (federal reserve bank kansa city, aug. 28–30), pp. 77–112. 4 bi review 57/2006 • increase travel expand opportunity citizen set financial account foreign countries, thereby contribute currency competition manner similar financial innovation. • satellite television internet heighten public awareness condition abroad, educate citizen financial opportunity elsewhere, raise pressure politician place limit opportunities. • deregulation financial sector spur type financial innovation i already discuss allow cross-border flow great competition among different type currency assets. the third factor economist public learn painful experience cost inflation.9 the end bretton wood gold standard early 1970s associate first global sustain peacetime inflation history. although specific experience differ across countries, public opinion eventually turn strongly allow inflation continue, policymakers respond pressure take strong measure achieve price stability. this learn process help drive financial innovation i discuss earlier, which, turn, help household business economize hold inflationary assets. economist central banker also devote great attention understand cause consequence inflation, provide intellectual underpin policy orient toward price stability. the fourth factor i wish mention relate change institution central bank may increase cost pursue high-inflation policies. the notable change increase independence many central bank correspond reduce control fiscal authority monetary policy. central bank independence reduce ability government "raid cookie jar" surprise inflation tax. in cases, central bank independence reverse majority vote parliament. but resort vote great obstacle inflationary finance previous arrangement allowed, especially give public’s increase sensitivity aversion inflation. central bank independence typically grant conjunction explicit mandate make achieve low stable inflation one goal monetary policy. central bank independence mandate include price stability increase credibility monetary policy regard achieve low inflation. policy credible central bank’s objective clear public central bank hold accountable fail achieve objectives. when citizen aware cost inflation government would reap low benefit high-inflation policy, institutional reform make central bank credible independent may likely adopt sustained.10 the fundamental force i mention early - financial innovation, deregulation, globalization, public understand cost inflation - provide impetus fight inflation open political path institutional reforms, central bank independence, enhance central bank credibility. once place, reform make progress inflation easy raise cost backsliding. a benefit stable price accrue financial market deepen become sophisticated, benefit sound economic policy help create support institutional reform make return inflation hard future governments. 9 this hypothesis raise discussion rogoff (2003). see guillermo ortíz, chair, "general discussion: globalization global disinflation," monetary policy uncertainty: adapt change economy: a symposium (federal reserve bank kansa city, aug. 28–30), pp. 119–130. for evidence voter latin america punish politician bad inflation outcome recent years, see eduardo lora mauricio oliveira (2005),

economics, vol. 42 (october), pp. 643–73. bi review 57/2006 5 benefit price stability while well know low stable inflation improve environment investment plan avoid many cost disruption associate frequent price adjustments, i want focus many benefit particularly relevant emerge markets. price stability boost growth deepen financial markets. with stable prices, saver investor confidence ultimate value deposit loans. stable price encourage growth financial intermediary financial markets. a note above, many emerge market recently experience deepen local financial market great issuance longer-dated paper. accord numerous studies, strong link financial market development economic growth. thus, great credibility central bank permit development local market economic benefit beyond financial sector.11the development long-term local-currency bond market may also help government firm plan long-term infrastructure investment project boost economic development. although debt market one many factor low cost long-term plan enhance ability undertake long-term investments, development markets, particularly accompany low real rates, help support longer-horizon project reduce effect foreign exchange movement activities. a good fiscal outlook, might arise high stable growth well good long-term planning, also increase financial market confidence development thus boost growth reinforce prospect continue price stability. this virtuous cycle appear happen key emerge market long plague poor fiscal situations, brazil mexico. in 1980s early 1990s, example, public sector deficit country often exceed 10 percent gdp. since late 1990s, deficit diminished. maintain progress although i optimist, i would remiss i point risk otherwise rosy scenario. the difficulty reach agreement doha round trade negotiation highlight risk renew protectionism. trade barrier reduce domestic international competition, one key factor behind low inflation, make country poorer. barrier free flow goods, services, capital would also diminish force factor outline help reduce inflationary pressures. we must forget example high inflation hyperinflation past: they hold important lesson cost maintain price stability. that sound policy basis solid economic growth forgotten. 11 see ross levine (2005), "finance growth: theory evidence," philippe aghion steven durlauf, eds., handbook economic

57/2006 toshihiko fukui: financial market real economy low interest rate environment open speech mr toshihiko fukui, governor bank japan, 13th international conference host institute monetary economic studies, bank japan, tokyo, 1 june 2006. * * * 1. introduction good morning, lady gentlemen. i please address 13th international conference host institute monetary economic studies. on behalf colleague bank japan, i welcome participant world. 2. theme year's conference the theme year's conference "financial market real economy low interest rate environment." i sure theme timely us, consider financial real economic condition face since 1990s. let elaborate point, focus japan's experience quantitative easing. 3. japan's experience quantitative ease since 1990s, japanese firm bank continue adjustment efforts. specifically, japanese firm tackle so-called "three excesses," is, excess debt, employment, production capacity, since burst economic bubble early 1990s. japanese bank suffer massive non-performing loan problem, plague stability financial system. in addition, around 2000, collapse so-called it bubble around globe place japan's economy recessionary phase. in circumstances, economy face risk fall deflationary spiral. once economy fall vicious spiral, hard get it, since expectation continue deflation self-reinforcing. to prevent vicious spiral, bank act decisively introduce quantitative ease policy. the quantitative ease policy two pillars: (1) provision ample liquidity bank adoption outstanding balance current account bank operate target money market operations; (2) commitment bank continue provide ample liquidity "until consumer price index (cpi, exclude fresh food) register stably zero percent increase year year." this policy package exert significant influence overall interest rate environment. specifically, provision ample liquidity drive uncollateralized overnight call rate, reflect credit risk borrower financial institutions, low 0.001 percent quantitative easing. in addition, commitment continue zero interest rate substantially flatten yield curve. the strong effect quantitative ease policy financial market clear compare u.s. situation 1930s. during 1930s, although u.s. treasury bill rate decline approximately zero percent, federal fund rate, rate financial institution lend borrow short-term funds, decline 0.25 percent. moreover, yield government bond much low japan mid-1990s onward unite state 1930s. thus, infer quantitative ease policy one decisive policy challenge central bank historical perspective. in retrospect, japan's economy finally start recover january 2002 strenuous effort firm bank resolve problem i mentioned. a aside, march 20, 2003 i assume office governor. at time, fact japan's economy already start recover beyond wide dreams. in inaugural address, i mention japan's economy still shaky ground. bi review 56/2006 1 subsequently, bank step quantitative ease increase current account balance bank far require reserves, well abide cpi commitment. also, october 2003, bank provide detail description commitment maintain quantitative ease policy perspective enhance transparency monetary policy. during this, always keep mind carefully nurture bud economic recovery. the quantitative ease policy show visible effect two fronts. first, policy, particularly ample liquidity provision, stabilize financial system, time strong concern stability. the ample liquidity bank supply meet surge financial institutions' liquidity demand, thus successfully avoid repetition large-scale credit crunch observe 1997 1998. second, quantitative ease policy create maintain accommodative environment support recovery japanese firms, commitment continue zero interest rates. in particular, bank lend rate interest rate corporate bond continue decline result flatten yield curve, well gradual decline credit risk premiums. various potential transmission channel quantitative ease discuss among economist time bank introduce policy. one channel portfolio rebalance channel: proportion safe asset current account balance bank increase asset portfolio financial institutions, expect adjust portfolios, typically increase hold risky asset loans. look back period quantitative ease policy, yet sure whether channel actually work not. the accommodative environment contribute finally put economy back onto solid recovery path. the year-on-year rate change core cpi rise surface october 2005 turn positive follow month. under circumstances, bank decide terminate quantitative ease policy march 2006. more specifically, bank decide change operate target money market operation outstanding balance current account bank uncollateralized overnight call rate. under new scheme, bank currently encourage uncollateralized overnight call rate remain effectively zero percent. during period adjustment process, japanese firm innovate continuously strengthen competitiveness. they also expand global supply-chain network particular emphasis develop strategic linkage asian counterparts. meanwhile, japanese bank overcome non-performing loan problem currently good position respond demand sophisticate financial service times. such revitalization firm bank improve efficiency market mechanism, thereby enable good allocation resources. 4. several question discuss in follows, let raise several question i hope discuss conference. first, financial market function historically low interest rate environment? have unexpected effect low interest rate policy detect financial markets? second, interaction financial market real economy change low interest rate environment? for instance, role play financial market asset price transmission mechanism monetary policy changed? third, consequence prolong low interest rate environment? in particular, low interest rate policy pose potential risk financial market real economy? fourth, evaluate recent low interest rate policy historical international perspectives? for instance, derive policy implication compare recent policy experience past episode combat deflation 1930s unite states? 5. final word there easy answer questions. during next two days, i look forward learn prominent scholar field central banker analysis perspective bi review 56/2006 2 "financial market real economy low interest rate environment." i also hope insight gain conference help future generation central bankers. it would utmost pleasure every one could obtain insight discussion follow. thank you. bi review 56/2006 3 vitor constâncio: finance regulation remark mr vitor constâncio, governor bank portugal, european association bank financial history, lisbon, 26 may 2006. * * * it indeed pleasure participate panel begin conference introduce historical perspective important subject relationship state financial services. history help u put perspective successive wave regulation deregulation mark delicate relationship. financial activity, bank activity particular, subject different type regulation since bank crisis previous century convince authority need. in general, finance process produce exchange store value order facilitate intertemporal decision save investment. normally, finance imply give liquidity present promise future returns. so, it’s activity intrinsically burden uncertainty imply trust expectation future. it also activity essential economic life open new opportunity society invest increase productivity. a grow complexity systemic risk involve introduce element public good considerations. it therefore understandable become activity subject public regulation, monitor supervision. the rationale regulation rest two type justifications: first, important externality associate systemic role financial sector second, nature activity asymmetry information create possibility market failure [see llewellyn (1999) good analysis issues]1 history show regulation supervision financial sector evolve response crisis major episode turbulence. robert gordon (2005) show instance recent paper2 one difference 20’s 90’s help explain financial crisis mild consequence late decade existence strong regulation supervision (capital requirements, deposit insurance etc). in fact, one feature recent decade remarkable decrease volatility real economy spite episode like 97/98 far east russian crisis demise 2000 previous exuberant boom. these shock seem contradict theory reduction shock explain note reduce volatility recent decades. more likely explanation find flurry financial innovation generalize risk-based price supply many new credit instrument help finance economic activity even unfavourable times. a second set reason include good public policies, improve supervision monetary policy. monetary policy particular successful provide environment stability enhance focus transparency anchor expectation help reduce risk premiums. this flat view contribution monetary authority preclude controversy surround relationship monetary financial stability, subject i address later. in spite positive effect modern finance contribute development stability economic activity increase concern financial stability objective policy. practically major central bank publish special report financial stability make clear see something fall within sphere competence. there ambiguity definition financial stability two main mean stand out. one, fundamental, follow mishkin (1991)3 define financial stability situation financial system able ensure last way, without major disruptions, efficient allocation save investment opportunities. in another sense, financial stability refer absence major misalignment asset price threaten future disruption market real economy. both mean course connect point notion smooth function financial institution markets. 1 llewellyn, david (1999) “the economic rationale financial regulation” fsa occasional paper series n. 1 2 gordon, robert (2005) “the 1920s 1990s mutual reflection” nber work paper n. 11778 3 mishkin, frederic s. (1991) “anatomy financial crisis” nber work paper n. 3934 bi review 56/2006 1 to justify recent concern financial stability list short term reason structural factors. the first one so-called global imbalance risk associate possible reversal asset price development various market may create turbulence detrimental real economy. the first issue much discuss despite possibility disrupt correction still reason hope wind situation happen gradual orderly manner. there nevertheless structural reason preoccupation supervisor monetary authority financial stability. these relate new development structural change financial sector generate new cause concern possibly justify new regulation increase monitoring. four aspect particularly relevant perspective: 1. there significant expansion financial sector past decade well growth rate real economy. the financial sector become important complex ensure stability become consequently essential. 2. the sector change direction market-based reduce role traditional relationship banking. technological development itc, great availability information, standardization financial contracts, contribute sort ‘commodification’ financial transactions. this imply monetary institution monetary aggregate lose weight total financial assets, mean leverage monetary base increase continuously. also, important underline expansion accompany great share non-regulated segment include hedge funds, private equity institution etc. 3. financial innovation produce new product tailor new security particular need term maturity, risk liquidity. the complexity derivative structure product grow time well size derivative markets. the recent example course phenomenal growth market credit derivatives. credit default swap (cds), collateralize debt obligation (cdo), credit-linked notes, credit spread option product develop market represent 16 trillion euro big total stock exist corporate bond loans. these instrument fulfil useful function allow transfer risk, isolate price pure credit risk, provide liquidity individual credit time stress improve management risk various institution etc. they create time new source risk due complexity, uncertainty mark-to-model valuation test time trouble specially secondary market liquid general. 4. the fourth aspect deserve mention refer grow interdependence market across type products, across institution across borders. the market-based financial system continue depend monetary institution provision liquidity credit lines. market different type asset tend depend common factor show co-movement returns. this great interconnectedness element create so-called ‘endogenous’ component risk, i.e. system-wide risk create financial sector result market participants’ collective behaviour effect main source risk. the increase concentration institution various market also add effect ‘endogenous’ risk the main driver structural change course technological progress movement liberalization globalization. the regulation system respond change evolve turbulent episode occurring. follow crisis 97/98 general enhancement regulation supervision financial sector. new international code standard develop bis, imf, iosco iais. the preparation new capital accord initiate recent approval change standard capital requirement direction sensitive risk previous basel i framework. in europe, mandatory implementation new international account standard introduce changes, always welcomed, report financial institution consequence prudential aspects. another important development improve sophistication macro-prudential function develop central banks, supervisor international institution analyse monitor major risk level system whole. the use model financial sector allow simulation various shock conduct stress test level. bi review 56/2006 2 despite improvement question remain change require regulation supervision system view new problem risk create recent structural changes. before venture opinion let stress positive aspects, include stability, stem changes. one general consideration well describe alan greenspan (1999): “multiple alternative transform economy's save capital investment act backup facility primary form intermediation fail.”4 this substitution different segment financial system help smooth overall financial flow contribute low volatility real economy. some empirical theoretical evidence accumulate document feature financial architecture [see peres jorge (2005)]5in direction contribute efficiency stability system go diversification instrument open new opportunity finance different type activity subject diverse contingency different phase cycle. this add effectiveness system foster growth. finally, worth stress new feature financial system imply significant progress management risk. the instrument risk transfer allow entry new player market enhance absorption credit risk although remain difficult ass risk end case general situation stress. this last point first element series new problem face result structural change experience system. that particular one specially relate credit derivative market. this new market source uneasiness due possibility operational risk liquidity problems. even positive aspect risk diversification foster market asset base security collateralize debt obligation misinterpret as, instance, existence ‘first loss’ tranche stay responsibility originator bank cannot ignored. those practice imply bank keep risky part securitised portfolio also remember transfer risk allow bank take risk feel advantage managing. it clear

point refer fact improvement manage risk make possible assumption new risk sometimes difficult evaluate. the appearance expansion segment non-regulated institutions, hedge fund particular, responsible significant increase financial activity source unease. a last point worth mention increase usual pro-cyclicality financial system. this consequence structural change already mentioned, regulatory

significant misalignment. this prospect certainly cause uneasiness monetary financial authorities. from standpoint interest examine two view seek identify general factor behind tendency asset price volatility. the first approach develop bi research, particular claudio borio philip lowe (2002)8. the main idea present circumstance monetary stability enough ensure financial stability may even contribute unstable price financial assets. this contradiction would stem success monetary authority guarantee price stability credible way. the coexistence environment low interest rate future inflation expectation well anchor low level define central bank objectives, would allow credit expansion would fuel asset price increases. if valid, view would disquiet central banker traditional view exactly opposite, i.e., stability price good service would stimulate market participant concentrate real factor affect fundamental valuation financial asset thus contribute low volatility respective markets. this view, certainly basically valid long term perspective, nevertheless incompatible possibility short term trade-off may exist monetary financial stability. that may case particular period transition long period disinflation monetary policy start change interest rate cycle long period low rates. central bank ignore possibility take consideration financial stability issue feel responsible explain usually embark interest rate smooth manage turn point policy measure pace. it stress existence short-term trade-off may create significant problem inflation target monetary policy

let state “it possible monetary policy suffer endemic asymmetry, efficient deal aftermath financial crisis, unsafe ineffective fight asset inflation. nevertheless, traditional asymmetry attribute monetary policy, one consider successful control inflation recessions, never obstacle use purposes. in vein, one could argue even without define precise targets, interest rate policy, certain circumstances, “lean wind” blow strongly asset markets. in case, elusive search anchor could help achieve monetary financial stability continue, monetary policy cannot ignore problem.” (constancio,

note paper. what come know “rajan risk” link structure incentive manager institution new financial environment. the gain importance market-based non-regulated institution reduce weight traditional banking, give prominence compensation scheme link return induce manager incur risky transactions. second, performance grow sector “investment institutions” tend measure essentially peer foster herd behaviour already present financial markets. both type behaviour increase probability episode asset price misalignments. the system tend assume risks, include so-called tail risk probability low loss

also return become correlate across suppose different type fund seem indicate could subject type risk period tight credit stressful equity markets. from question emerge determine new regulation necessary could helpful stage. we always cautious introduce new regulation evaluation cost must always consider possible merits. also, thorough dialogue sector conduct determine really work practice compatible incentive institution comply rules. also, alternative route rely disclosure information institution create condition good market discipline always considered. this could be, instance, approach adopt case hedge fund seem exist internationally great reluctance introduce regulation supervision segment. the argument base idea public policy justify protect sophisticate investors, tend forget system-wide role institution play possible systemic consequences. more generally, rajan make proposal market institution encourage impose practice require manager wealth invest several year fund manage. nevertheless, mention immediately that: “this clearly, again, panacea – manager ltcm substantial stake enterprise…” the idea put forward charles goodhart (2005)12 capital requirement

disclosure information new non-regulated institution followed, authority rely enhance market discipline indirect route put pressure supervise entity provide liquidity credit line new ‘investment institutions’. so, always, wait system test order see regulation adjust new financial structures. let finalize remark let address issue role central bank relation financial stability, even don’t responsibility supervision. in first place, improve already field macro-prudential analysis. besides publish financial stability reports, authority normally conduct top-down stress test ass resilience system various shocks. in context, new progress make improve methodology model financial sector interaction economy. also, international cooperation field macro-prudential activity would welcomed.

actively research department effort understand good way modern finance operate may create risk economy, particular emphasis model feedback effect occur real economy financial sector behaviour. understand certainly necessary first step avoid mistake overcome difficulty monetary financial authority encounter fulfil mission. a great scientist said: “to able formulate question answer them”. one could wish would also true solve real life…. bi review 56/2006 6 rakesh mohan: monetary policy exchange rate framework - indian experience presentation mr rakesh mohan, deputy governor reserve bank india, second high level seminar asian financial integration organise international monetary fund monetary authority singapore, singapore, 25 may 2006. the assistance michael patra, himanshu joshi, rajib da partha ray preparation address gratefully acknowledged. the reference speech find reserve bank india’s website www.rbi.org.in. * * * i would like congratulate international monetary fund monetary authority singapore hold second high level seminar asian financial integration. this forum provide good opportunity u exchange notes, idea view continuously evolve texture international financial architecture, particular affect asia asian financial growth impact rest world. the international financial landscape today clearly much complex previous decades. in country monetary policy make become delicate balance act imperative domestic economic, financial monetary concern evolve international situation observe closely real time basis take given. the rapid change technological change, financial innovation globalisation bring financial market also force work take account of. we live interest times, job central banker perhaps make world le interest implementation policy ensure monetary financial stability! indian economic reform process decade half seem propel u high growth path 8 per cent plus gdp growth. our challenge monetary policy make ensure growth path preserved, accelerated, provide macro-economic environment characterise monetary, price financial stability. a i document further, among change go last decade half, key transformation increase openness indian economy. within that, economic relationship rest asia also intensify sustain expansion trade hence financial relationship well. give emerge economic demographic world, shift economic weight towards asia, conscious need increase integration asia role evolve come years. each asian country experience significant change operation monetary policy open economy framework recent years. whereas face many similar problems, particularly impact international development international crude oil price hikes, domestic development continue carry great weight economy monetary macro-economic management approaches. i, therefore, think best thing i today facilitate discussion provide brief description evaluation india's experience implement significant structural change framework monetary exchange rate management increasingly market orient open economy. i. change monetary policy framework in aftermath balance payment crisis 1991, stabilization undertake simultaneously structural reform wide area indian economy. this dramatic change context fundamentally alter manner monetary policy begin formulated. first, give reality multiple goal assign monetary authority, achievement macroeconomic price stability receive great emphasis. thus overall objective approach flexible time variant manner continuous rebalancing priority growth price stability, depend underlie macroeconomic financial conditions. a observe severe cost financial instability elsewhere, financial stability ascend hierarchy monetary policy objective since second half 1990s. strong synergy complementarity observe price stability financial stability india. accordingly, bi review 56/2006 1 believe regulation, supervision development financial system remain within legitimate ambit monetary policy broadly interpreted. second, operate framework monetary policy undergo transformation 1990s. a variety administer intervention interest rate bank credit flow characteristic 1970s 1980s give way early 1990s brief period broad monetary policy rule ‘monetary target feedback’. from second half 1990s, reserve bank india (rbi) switch multiple indicator approach high frequency low frequency indicator track information use draw policy perspectives. third, grow market orientation monetary policy tilt choice instrument decisively direct indirect market-based monetary policy measures. on eve reforms, statutory pre-emption form cash reserve ratio (crr) statutory liquidity ratio (slr) requirement lock away nearly 70 per cent bank deposits, severely erode profitability financial system effectiveness monetary policy. the slr bring 38.5 per cent net demand time liability (ndtl) early 1992 25 per cent mid -1994. the crr progressively reduce 5 per cent 15 per cent 1991. fourth, interest rate deregulation initiate across different segments. in september 1990, sector-specific use specific interest rate prescription abolish except loan rs.200,000 subject minimum rate prescription. in october 1994, minimum rate prescription withdraw lend rate bank make free subject set prime lend rate (plr). in 2003, bank advise announce benchmark plr transparently reflect actual cost funds. at present, bank enjoy flexibility price loan advance use market benchmark time vary spread objective transparent manner. interest rate number loan advances, include advance acquire residential properties, purchase consumer durables like determine without reference benchmark plr. although, save bank deposit rate continue regulated, 1995, rate term deposit maturity two year freed. in follow year, rate deposit one year maturity freed. by october 1997, ceiling rate deposit thirty day one year maturity period removed. currently, deposit rate maturity free minimum maturity period term deposit reduce 7 day 2004. bank offer differential rate interest wholesale domestic term deposit different offer retail domestic term deposits. interest rate ceiling export credit foreign currency non-resident deposit prescribe transparently link international interest rates. the reserve bank provide information website range deposit rate lend rates. we, thus, make carefully calibrate transition administer interest rate regime one market determine interest rate period time, minimise disruption preserve financial stability. this approach also provide market participant adequate time adjust new regime. interest rate deregulation essential smoothen transmission channel monetary policy enhance signal effect policy changes. however, rigidity remain certain segment hind overall efficiency interest rate resource allocation. in context, administer interest rate fix government number small save scheme provident fund special relevance generally offer rate high correspond instrument available market well tax incentives. a bank compete fund small save schemes, rate offer long-term deposit mobilize bank set floor lend rate level high would obtain competitive market conditions. in fact, observe factor contribute downward stickiness lend rates, implication effectiveness monetary policy. this reality appreciate live give absence social security coverage adequate safety net country. these small save scheme administer government wide reach post offices, commercial banks, provide small saver access tax save instrument see safe stable. whereas impact term blunt monetary transmission mechanisms, perhaps see contribute overall financial stability. benchmarking administer interest rate market determine rate propose time time. whereas rationalisation scheme indeed done, progress depend emergence good social security pension systems, perhaps easy access marketable sovereign instruments. bi review 56/2006 2 finally, sector-specific refinance facility phase except export credit refinance. a liquidity adjustment facility (laf) consist repo / reverse repo government security emerge since june 2000 main operate instrument monetary policy. the laf serf two objectives. first, provide great flexibility address day-to-day liquidity mismatches. second, set corridor overnight market interest rates, impart stability market. the laf rate serve tool liquidity management well signal interest rates. the effectiveness laf perceptibly improve efficacy monetary policy transmission. the evolution autonomous monetary policy 1990s also depend effective removal fiscal dominance exist early automatic monetisation fiscal deficits. over period 1994-97, subvention phase agreement government rbi, mark unique milestone monetary–fiscal coordination. another important institutional change free rbi’s balance sheet burden exchange guarantee accumulate pre-reform era. legislative amendment carry out, first 2000 2006, strengthen rbi's regulatory jurisdiction financial market term operation forex, money government security markets. these legislative change expect empower rbi term instrument independence hence effectiveness monetary policy. in term process, also proceed towards great transparency consultation, increase frequency policy review semi-annual quarterly. alongside enhancement accountability also attempt great transparency communicate monetary policy. go forward, key issue, give institutional empowerment, speed quality transmission monetary policy impulses. this subject matter follow section. ii. monetary transmission consistent structural change monetary policy framework, improvement channel transmission emerge early concurrent objective order enhance policy effectiveness. accordingly, rbi simultaneously undertake development domestic financial market spectrum, sequence process deregulation interest rates, withdrawal statutory pre-emptions, qualitative improvement monetary-fiscal coordination progressive liberalisation exchange payment regime, include institution market orient exchange rate policy. the development financial market india encompass introduction new market segments, new instrument sharp focus regulatory oversight. the indian money market fairly underdevelop till mid-1980s; dominate overnight segment narrow base, limit number participant administer interest rate since december 1973. in 1987, participation widen lend side institution set market maker orderly development market. select institution allow borrow money market term basis ceiling interest rate withdraw 1989. new instrument like certificate deposit (cds) commercial paper (cp) introduce 1989 1990 interest rate money market instrument become progressively market determined. in 1998, rbi initiate process develop overnight money market pure interbank market. the phase non-banks money market sequence period 2000-05. non-banks (except pd allow operate overnight market) largely migrate new collateralised market develop consonance. non-banks take recourse collateralised repos outside rbi purpose borrow lend funds. an innovative money market instrument call collateralised borrow lend obligation (cblo) introduce january 2003, provide investor benefit guarantee settlement exit option maturity. trade volume collateralised money market increase substantially. technological upgradation accompany development money market. effort currently underway introduce screen-based negotiate quote-driven deal call/notice term money markets. information overnight rate volume would disseminate rbi order enable market participant ass liquidity condition efficient transparent manner. the indian foreign exchange market widen deepen transition market-determined exchange rate system march 1993 subsequent liberalisation restriction various external transaction lead current account convertibility article viii article agreement international monetary fund 1994. since mid-1990s, bank authorise entity accord significant freedom operate market. bank bi review 56/2006 3 allow freedom fix trade limit borrow invest fund overseas market specify limits. they allow use derivative product hedge risk asset-liability management purposes. similarly, corporates give flexibility book forward cover base past turnover allow use variety instrument like interest rate currency swaps, caps/collars forward rate agreements. the swap market hedge longer-term exposure develop substantially recent years. a number step also take liberalise capital account cover foreign direct investment, portfolio investment, outward investment include direct investment well depository receipt convertible bonds, open indian corporate office abroad like. in recent years, reserve bank delegate exchange control procedure bank authorise dealer extent hardly need approach reserve bank approval. these reform reflect vibrancy activity various segment foreign exchange market daily turnover u $33 billion (as end april 2006). the government security market move auction-based system 1992 obtain good price discovery impart great transparency operations. this major institutional change which, along free money foreign exchange market phase automatic monetisation fiscal deficits, create conducive environment progressive deregulation follow. the set well capitalise primary dealer (pds) deal government security follow 1995, back introduction delivery versus payment (dvp) government securities, adoption new technique floatation, introduction new instruments, particularly treasury bill vary maturity repos central government date security treasury bill maturity april 1997. it may mention since april 1992, entire central government borrow programme date security conduct auctions. in 2005 reserve bank put place anonymous order match system improve price discovery, settlement procedure mitigate risks. to activate trade improve depth security market, introduction "when issued" market also announce recently. all measure bring significant change new treasury culture developing, contribute formation term structure interest rates. the demand government security drive consideration effective management liquidity rather statutory liquidity requirements. effort make improve retail hold government security since government security market still lack depth dominate bank financial institution often exhibit uni-directional perception liquidity. to attract retail participation government security market, one foremost task ahead create environment provide safe secure investment avenue small investor adequate return liquidity. in context, rbi emphasise provision demat hold facility non-institutional retail/small investor risk mitigation scrip loss settlement deal secondary market. non-competitive bid also introduce since january 2002 direct access primary issue non-sophisticated investors. the corporate debt market india existence since independence 1947. it since mid - 1980s, however, state own public enterprise (psus) begin issue bonds. in absence well function secondary market, debt instrument remain highly illiquid unpopular among invest population large. corporates continue prefer private placement public issue raise resources. the dominance private placement attribute several factors, viz., ease procedure operation private placement, considerably high cost public issues, high subscription private placements. financial institution tend dominate public issue primary corporate debt market. the secondary market corporate debt suffer lack market make result poor liquidity, tendency part institutional investor hold security maturity consequent reduction market supply securities. several measure take recent past transform corporate debt market india. some measure include de-materialisation electronic transfer securities, roll settlement, introduction sophisticate risk management, trade settlement systems. towards end 2003, step also take reform private placement market. all measure expect improve function corporate debt market india. it need recognised, however, difficult develop corporate bond market everywhere. just half world’s corporate bond market us, another 15 per cent japan. among countries, uk long stand bond market, european one still developing. bi review 56/2006 4 among develop countries, perhaps south korea reasonably well develop bond market. the corporate debt market india large potential raise resource particularly infrastructure projects, house corporate municipal needs. appropriate institutional processes, development various market segment include mortgage – back security bond insurance institution credit enhancement, ease cost abridgment disclosure requirement list companies, rat requirement unlisted companies, suitable framework market making, consolidation, centralize data base primary issue wide public information, real time trade report system dissemination information, access rtgs state art technology would provide strong impetus corporate bond market grow india. a key area emphasis development financial market india provision appropriate technological infrastructure trading, clearing, payment settlement. since late 1990s, establishment modern, robust payment settlement system consistent international best practice emerge important objective rbi. a three-pronged strategy consolidation, development integration pursue regard. consolidation revolve around strengthen exist payment system provide late level technology. the developmental dimension include real time gross settlement, centralise fund management, security settlement structure financial messaging. other key element technological content market development electronic clear (introduced 1994), electronic find transfer (1996), quick fund transfer centralize settlement mumbai (2003), negotiate deal system (nds), screen base order match system (2002) electronic report trade online dissemination system submission bid primary issuance government security clear corporation india ltd. (ccil), promote banks, financial institution primary dealer clear settlement trade foreign exchange, government security debt instruments, commence operation april 2001. the ccil act central counterparty (ccp) transaction guarantee settlement trade execute rule regulation eliminate counterparty risk adherence international best practices. oversight payment settlement system vest national payment council, board payment settlement system establish within rbi. a may see brief description various measure take develop market institutional framework efficient monetary policy transmission, development market arduous time consume activity require conscious policy make implementation. market develop function overnight: created, nurture monitor continuous basis start function autonomously. iii. exchange rate management the regime shift conduct exchange rate management india occur early 1990s significant impact monetary policy framework. coincidentally, 1990s characterise bout currency turmoil contagious financial crisis many part world, developing, transitional develop alike. monetary policy become increasingly complex. for majority develop countries, include asian region, continue depend export performance, appropriate exchange rate determination great importance volatility impose significant real effect term fluctuation employment output distribution activity tradeables non-tradeables, fluctuation difficult absorb economies. in fiercely competitive trade environment country seek expand market share aggressively fiercely compress margins, volatility exchange rate easily translate ex ante profit ex post loss along deleterious collateral impact employment economic welfare. the determinant exchange rate behaviour however, seem alter dramatically. earlier, factor relate change merchandise trade flow behaviour commodity price inflation well understand provide guidance operate monetary policy. in environment, monetary policy principally target low inflation consistent exchange rate change purchase power parity. these traditional anchor understand sweep away vicissitude capital movements, currency often move far alignment traditional fundamentals. moreover, appear expectation even momentary reaction day’s news often important determine fluctuation capital flow hence serf amplify exchange rate volatility. furthermore, liquidity impact capital flow become even important problem monetary management case hitherto. the globalisation financial markets, even bi review 56/2006 5 imperfect, magnify impact monetary policy action take one country others. the policy accommodation pursue recently u global impact, affect rest world abundance liquidity. low interest rate u encourage capital flow emerge market economies. this result large build-up foreign exchange reserve excessive domestic liquidity many country asia, amplify fed’s policy stance. complicate environment monetary exchange rate management further, increase evidence exchange rate pass-through domestic inflation tend decline 1990s across number countries. inflation turn much le sensitive exchange rate tend equilibrate around globe (mohan, 2005). in india, exchange rate regime 1990 best describe adjustable nominal peg basket currency major trade partner band. after balance payment crisis 1991 two-step downward adjustment exchange rate undertake july 1991 follow transitional 11-month period dual exchange rate market-determined exchange rate system set place march, 1993. since then, exchange rate largely determine demand supply condition market. the exchange rate policy recent year guide broad principle careful monitor management exchange rate flexibility, without fix target pre-announced target band, allow underlie demand supply condition determine exchange rate movement period orderly way. subject predominant objective, exchange rate policy guide need reduce excess volatility, prevent emergence destabilise speculative activities, help maintain adequate level reserves, develop orderly foreign exchange market. the indian market, like develop country markets, yet deep broad, sometimes characterise uneven flow demand supply different periods. in situation, reserve bank india prepare make sale purchase foreign currency order even lumpy demand supply relatively thin forex market smoothen jerky movements. however, intervention govern predetermine target band around exchange rate. a foreign exchange exposure indian economy expands, role uneven demand see reduce. while possible country remain completely unaffected development international exchange markets, fortunately able keep spillover effect asian crisis minimum constant monitor timely action, include recourse strong monetary measures, necessary, prevent emergence self-fulfilling speculative activity (mohan, 2005). the experience capital flow important lesson choice exchange rate regime. the advocacy corner solution – fix peg without monetary policy independence freely float exchange rate retain discretionary conduct monetary policy – distinctly decline. the weight experience seem tilt favour intermediate regime country-specific features, without target level exchange rate exchange market intervention fight extreme market turbulence. in general, emerge market economy accumulate massive foreign exchange reserve circuit breaker situation unidirectional expectation become self-fulfilling. recent information suggest india’s integration world economy get stronger, implication conduct exchange rate policy future. trade good (i.e., export plus imports) proportion gdp increase 14.6 per cent 1990-91 28.9 per cent 2004-05; gross current account receipt payment percentage gdp increase 19.4 per cent 45.0 per cent period, reflect growth buoyant indian trade services. correspondingly, capital account, gross flow (total inflow plus outflows) double proportion gdp: 12 per cent 1990-91 24 per cent (us$ 167 billion) 2004-05. thus, indian economy substantially expose international economy hence increasingly subject vicissitude international financial developments. there also grow evidence point distinct strengthen india’s balance payments, benefit equilibrate property flexible exchange rate regime. recent development balance payment seem indicate indian economy enter expansionary phase business cycle. a noteworthy feature re-emergence current account deficit (cad) since 2004-05 hiatus three year surpluses, precede decade cad average 1 per cent gdp. oil imports, account quarter total imports, record high growth rate contribute 47 per cent change current account deficit 2004-05 previous year. the elevate level international crude price rule currently affect country across globe india exception. apart impact high crude oil price, significant growth merchandise trade deficit 2004-05 2005-06 also cause sizeable growth non-oil bi review 56/2006 6 good imports, emanate capital goods, export-related input range intermediate good intrinsic growth link character. besides, large expansion import also spur vigorous export growth. in sense, merchandise trade deficit acquire growth lead dimension thus positive feature indian economy. a current account deficit widens, contribute unwind global imbalance margin, give consideration sustainable magnitude current account deficit. this sustainability depend perceive stability capital flow which, turn, would dependent assessment growth prospect economy foreign lender investors. whereas understand open economy access international capital flow run high current account deficit le open one, approach issue remain inform appropriate caution interest financial stability. the acceleration overall growth re-emergence current account deficit since 2004-05 accompany great degree openness. the growth current payment accompany healthy growth current receipt - good services, thus provide confidence sustainability current trade pattern financial stability. current receipt pay 90 per cent current payments. within current receipts, merchandise export rapidly exceed term growth rate software earn wide variety business services. besides, private transfer receipts, comprise mainly remittance indian work abroad, seem acquire permanent character rise steadily constitute around 3 per cent gdp recent years, impervious exchange rate movements. it need mention oil price increase typically result high remittance india well non-resident deposit inflow capital account, produce non-linearity impact international crude price indian economy. these factor strengthen capability indian economy sustain high cad past. net capital flow regularly exceed cad requirement fair measure, enable large accretion reserves. in fact, expansion cad 2005-06 mask strength capital flows. with increase exposure international economy, trade current account flows, along capital flows, indian economy enter uncharted territory, although healthy one accounts. we find approach broad market determination exchange rate, flexibility, combine intervention felt necessary, serve well far. a proceed feel confident continue similar direction future, constantly monitor situation make change may become desirable. iv. deal change recent development pose test challenge conduct monetary exchange rate management india rest world. while world gdp growth well long-run average 3.8 per cent, grow incidence large systemic shocks. though price stability maintain face oil shock, risk loom large form lag second order effect oil price increases, geopolitical tensions, probability disorderly rapid adjustment current account imbalance risk emanate house market, particularly cycle turn down. the outlook oil economy near term appear tilt favour high price great volatility. global imbalance widen 2005 environment rise interest rate worldwide ample liquidity global financial markets. the current account deficit u surpass u $800 billion, match increase surplus elsewhere, particularly europe, east asia oil-exporting countries. while deficit still increasing, location surplus appear change recently. the current account surplus oil-exporting country middle east close emerge asia. le third combine current account surplus oil-exporting country reflect foreign exchange reserves, rose, u $90 billion 2005. there indication oil surplus deploy diversify avenue new investment agency oil stabilisation fund could invest asset bank deposits. in environment trend growth world economy, unusually low volatility financial market strong profitability bank system countries, investor prepare purchase risky asset relatively high price 2005. monitor risk lie become difficult regulators, due emergence large conglomerates, sophisticate market instrument derivative presence player like hedge funds. in environment, volatile bi review 56/2006 7 unpredictable change asset price could become source financial instability. to maintain confidence financial system, necessary prevent shock spread contagion. private capital inflow emerge market economy increase 2005; market access continue favourable external finance cost drop sharply. there low level credit spread bond issue emerge market company low credit ratings, around low level since 1997. partly response positive borrow conditions, increase number emerge market country able issue long-term debt currency thereby reduce foreign currency exposure rollover risk. of major central banks, u federal reserve raise policy rate 25 basis point sixteen occasion 1.0 per cent june 2004 5.0 per cent may 2006. the ecb bank england hint policy rate increase come months. under conditions, certain stylise aspect exchange market behaviour need keep mind deal monetary exchange rate management medium term perspective. first, day-to-day exchange rate movement short-run foreign exchange market little so-called ‘fundamentals’ country’s capacity meet payment obligations, include debt service. second, view inter-bank activity, set pace forex markets, transaction volume “gross” term several time higher, variable, “net” flows. third, develop country generally small localise forex market nominal domestic currency value generally expect show depreciate trend, particularly relative inflation rate high major industrial countries. in situation, great tendency among market participant hold long position foreign currency hold back sale expectation adverse currency depreciating, way round currency appreciate expectation favourable. in recent years, exchange rate trend mix despite existence inflation differentials. consequently, also see change behavioural trends. fourth, tendency importers/exporters end-users look exchange rate movement source return without adopt appropriate risk management strategies, times, create uneven supply-demand conditions, often base “news views”. a self-sustaining triangle supply demand mismatch, increase inter-bank activity take advantage accentuate volatility trigger negative sentiments, tune fundamental set motion, require quick intervention/response authorities. against back ground, india’s exchange rate policy focus manage volatility fix rate target allow underlie demand supply condition determine exchange rate movement period orderly way stand test time. despite several unexpected external domestic developments, india’s external situation continue remain satisfactory. our experience also highlight importance build foreign exchange reserve take care unforeseen contingencies, volatile capital flow developments, affect expectation adversely emerge economy rely largely resource external exigency (or contagion) international “lender last resort” provide additional liquidity short notice acceptable terms. thus, need adequate reserve unlikely eliminate reduce even exchange rate allow float freely. the overall approach management india’s foreign exchange reserve recent year reflect change composition balance payments, endeavour reflect “liquidity risks” associate different type flow requirements. the policy reserve management thus judiciously build upon host identifiable factor contingencies. such factors, inter alia, include: size current account deficit; size short-term liability (including current repayment obligation long-term loans); possible variability portfolio investment type capital flows; unanticipated pressure balance payment arise external shock movement repatriable foreign currency deposit non-resident indians. take factor account, india’s foreign exchange reserve present comfortable, although pursue policy long-term basis raise issue sustainability strategy especially backdrop uninterrupted inflow foreign capital, optimum sterilization flows, appropriate instrument cost pursue sterilization associate liquidity management. in fact, conduct monetary policy management context large volatile capital flow prove difficult many countries. a key issue face india admidst sweep wind change work policy mix instrument liquidity management consistent monetary policy framework operate procedures. in context, indian experience sterilisation liquidity management bi review 56/2006 8 somewhat unique compare approach follow central bank asia. for instance, central bank indonesia, korea, malaysia, philippines, thailand sterilise inflow different ways. the bank indonesia (bi) employ open market operation (omos) issue paper also manage budgetary operation way build large deposit bank indonesia. while bank thailand (bot) conduct omos sterilize inflows, central bank bill use extensively bank korea (bok) late use quantitative control discount policy dampen domestic credit. bank negara malaysia (bnm) historically deploy government deposit central bank impact monetary liquidity. on hand, china sterilise capital inflow issuance central bank bill apart use instrument like reserve requirements, differentiate prudential treatment bank base capital strength, etc. in indian context, sharp shift capital flow hence liquidity mark period 2001-06 explain partly frictional arise seasonal transient factor partly cyclical, associate pick growth momentum induce demand bank credit. this warrant appropriate monetary operation obviate wide fluctuation market rate ensure reasonable stability consistent monetary policy stance. in fact, indian experience illustrate tight link external sector management domestic monetary management. what may small movement capital flow rest world translate large domestic liquidity movement distort market exchange interest rate develop country. moreover, absorption external save also dependent stage business cycle country may go through. in case, early year decade characterise low industrial growth hence absorptive capacity country constrained. a enter expansionary phase current account widen potential great absorption manifest itself. just foreign exchange reserve act shock absorber, external front, look parallel liquidity shock absorber domestic monetary management. in context, new instrument, name market stabilisation scheme (mss) evolve useful instrument monetary policy sustain open market operations. the ms make operational april 2004. under scheme, mean exclusively liquidity management, reserve bank empower issue government treasury bill medium duration date security purpose liquidity absorption. the scheme work impound proceed

global development expect increase role determine conduct monetary exchange rate policy countries. in environment global convergence, retain independence monetary policy may become increasingly difficult, call hard choice term goal instruments. v. financial integration asia - issue in era increase globalisation, discussion monetary policy exchange rate framework cannot do isolation. it is, therefore, pertinent place indian experience context asian economic co-operation. recent year witness expansion channel integration within asian region, build primarily strong macroeconomic performance. asia account 30 per cent world gdp contribute half global growth. while asian development bank place aggregate gdp growth region 7.3 per cent 2004, bi review 56/2006 9 imf world economic outlook, project growth emerge asian economy 7.3 per cent year 2005 too. inflationary pressure experience asian country 2004 2005, moderate context high growth oil prices. gdp growth emerge asia drive robust export growth well strong domestic demand. sustain rapid growth recent year rise live standard accompany dramatic increase asia's share world export raw material consumption. clearly, globalization major impact asia’s role world economy ongoing transformation composition production trade rise comparative advantage globally. in particular, economy relatively high wage cost shift toward high value-added products, include services, within region. furthermore, financial flow within region become significant, intermediate save within asia, well channel part world. the emerge market asia, dynamic skilled work force, well place take advantage new technology seize opportunity international market place become major engine growth global economy. strong economic performance accompany accumulation foreign exchange reserve build resilience external shock (reserve bank india, 2006). a asian region developed, intra asian trade gather momentum lead even high economic integration within region. this aid existence asean, progressively lead low trade barrier among member countries. a asean region develop gain confidence trade link develop country japan, china korea also intensified, along structure discussion towards formation ptas ftas within region. while trade integration intensify time progress financial integration limited. understandably, increase discussion nature prospect progressive financial integration commensurate degree economic integration observe region. although financial integration asia possibly lag trade integration, initiative take front get stronger. central bank cooperation asia network swap formalise chiang mai agreement 2000 among central bank east asia. among others, lead two parallel movement – one south asia form saarc initiative east asia reflect asean+3 initiative. the idea integrate financial system provide viable ‘safety net’ time crisis germinate quite strongly. more recently, discussion adoption asian currency unit avoid volatility intra-asian currency movement create one principal currency world. in context, important revisit first principles. india's engagement south east east asia also upswing. the share export develop asia india’s total export double 14 per cent 1990-91 almost 30 per cent 2005-06. the correspond share region india’s import also increase 14 per cent 21 per cent period. in recent years, china emerge major trade partner india, account 6.0 per cent total export 7.4 per cent total import 2005-06. in recognition expansion economic engagement rest asia, governor y.v. reddy announce first imf-mas seminar hold last year, already implement computation new six country real effective exchange rate (reer) index. this new index introduce two new currencies, remnimbi hong kong dollar supplement early currency basket include u dollar, pound sterling, euro, japanese yen (reddy, 2005). in post-asian crisis period, several asian economy adopt different type intermediate exchange rate regime grow preference relatively flexible exchange rate before. in respect, key issue much flexibility envisage optimal? what instrument manage exchange rates? it also necessary regard recognize re-assess optimal level ‘insurance’ provide foreign exchange reserve need potentially volatile disruptive capital flows. finally, recent sharp upward movement oil price era heighten uncertainty may evoke differential response account country-specific factors. it milieu pragmatic choice instrument integration region regional trade agreements, best view expression enlighten self-interest. the move towards regionalism catalyze grow consensus enhancement public good require coordinate action belief overlap fortunes. india also enter various regional economic cooperation, free/preferential trade agreement bilateral investment treaty asian neighbours. bi review 56/2006 10 draw experience lesson regional blocks, important take cognizance certain issue successful function cooperative monetary arrangement envisage common currency unit. while single currency work well context trade bloc center usa, lesson also draw recent experience monetary economic integration europe. the history european monetary integration date back creation trade bloc - european economic community (eec) - 1958, take shape european monetary system (ems) 1979 fluctuate exchange rate band among member countries. currently, 12 country comprise common euro area (monetary union), although 25 country constitute member state european union (eu). some eu member country actively try part euro area fulfil four broad convergence criterion stipulated. the objective monetary union euro area clearly define maastricht treaty primary objective european central bank (ecb) maintain price stability euro area. price stability define european central bank inflation rate close 2 per cent medium-term. the integration largely facilitate institutional framework evolve forty years. it may useful note unite states, may see large currency area, single currency work existence labour mobility across region wage price flexibility, within across regions, i.e., due real factor determine real effective exchange rate (reer) long-run competitiveness. on hand, europe, introduction single currency meet resistance due language cultural difference historically limit labour mobility wage flexibility. labor union powerful europe unite states, make real wage sticky. moreover, product market competition le intense, european producer likely pas wage cost consumer form high prices. reflect factors, unemployment european country appear persistent nature us. suffice conclude jury still merit common currency reduce flexibility economy adjust real sector change (as see europe). this turn, cause differential effective overvaluation/undervaluation currency across different country within currency union possible erosion long-term competitiveness affect countries. relative euro area, asian region exhibit much pronounce diversity economic structure, stage development, demographic features, social political system even low mobility factor production, particularly labour. the successful operation currency area dependent wage flexibility labour mobility across regions. with existence common external exchange rate, effective internal flexibility "exchange rate" particular region achieve low high wages, necessary, relative rest currency area. equilibration achieve labour mobility respond inter-regional wage differences. furthermore, find europe, imposition maastricht criteria, commonality fiscal condition across country desirable effective area-wide monetary policy. any movement towards great monetary exchange rate cooperation among asian country need pay explicit attention set difficult issues. meanwhile, doubt great financial cooperation lead great trade facilitation foster great capital market linkage among asian country would move right direction. a great variation among asian country regard existence current account surplus deficits, great capital market linkage development bond markets, trade settlement system like, enable surplus country invest deficit country within region. thus asian save would potential put use foster growth within region. vi. conclusion cooperation among central bank around asia likely play key role nurture broad – base mandate integration. this evidence help exchange view information various subject common interests. central bank cooperation help resolve mexican crisis 1994. the recent ultimate form central bank cooperation achieve 1998 european central bank (ecb) create sole authority monetary policy among 11 member creation new common currency january 1999. on hand, accord experts, central bank cooperation lead moral hazard and, therefore, tamper bi review 56/2006 11 otherwise efficient market determine exchange rates, trade flow general function market forces. nevertheless, context region, central bank cooperation indispensable. in fact, improvement transportation communication, commonality world view operation economy, enhance institutional arrangements, central bank cooperation grow extensively. the increase degree global integration liberalization capital movement would serve dominant factor encourage cooperation amongst central bank region. furthermore, major implication grow financial trade integration, globally well within region, great susceptibility monetary policy exchange rate management global factor relative domestic factors, necessitate increase co-ordination macro-economic management. the perceive benefit cost economic integration country within large region see context economy's resilience possible shock open economy framework. the ability country derive benefit economic cooperation presence volatility international capital flow ultimately contingent upon quality macroeconomic framework institutions. bi review 56/2006 12 mark w olson: what examiner look examine bank compliance? remark mr mark w olson, member board governor u federal reserve system, american banker association's regulatory compliance conference, orlando, 12 june 2006. * * * thank invitation speak today issue great interest many us, is, compliance-risk management supervisory expectations. over last years, legal regulatory compliance breakdown attract increase attention across financial industry. fortunately, respond evolve compliance risk invest effective compliance-risk management programs. however, then, headline-grabbing incident noncompliance continue capture public attention, especially involve sensitive area fair lend bank secrecy act (bsa). conference valuable opportunity you, compliance experts, share experience successful approach control compliance risk. to assist effort fine-tune compliance-risk management programs, i'd like give sense federal reserve examiner look conduct examinations. i also take minute address focus work two particularly important area regulatory compliance: compliance bsa requirement home mortgage disclosure act (hmda) data report requirements. otherwise, i focus examination look solely level compliance specific law regulation focus examiner ass adequacy compliance-risk management program ability manage organization's compliance risk. compliance-risk management overall, bank organization's compliance-risk management program enable adequately identify, measure, monitor, control compliance risk involve various product line business. these fundamental principle compliance-risk management, also sound management credit, market, liquidity, operational risk. it's worth take moment define compliance risk. it risk legal regulatory sanctions, financial loss, damage reputation franchise value may arise organization fail comply laws, regulations, standard code conduct self-regulatory organization applicable business activity function bank organization. while bank organization program place effectively manage compliance risk, program vary considerably, depend size, complexity, geographic reach bank organization inherent risk activities. a type risk, large multinational organization require elaborate formal compliance-risk management system address broad typically complex range financial activity provide senior manager director information need monitor direct activities. therefore, supervisory expectation regard organization's risk-management program, specifically scope examination, vary accord organization's size complexity. assess adequacy compliance-risk management program the federal reserve's supervisory approach area compliance-risk management consistent long-standing focus adequacy bank organizations' overall management risk. to end, federal reserve examiner ass quality bank organization's system identifying, measuring, contain risks. while historically great emphasis risk management area credit, market, operational, liquidity risk, grow complexity bank operation regulatory framework federal reserve take great interest bank organizations' ability manage compliance risk. bi review 56/2006 1 scoping examination generally, federal reserve examination team begin define scope examination; examiner determine area focus level scrutiny. the scope examination vary depend nature circumstance bank organization. for example, part scoping exercise, examiner consider previous examination audit find determine whether organization satisfactory history compliance whether previous concern compliance-risk management program. the examination team also review organization's compliance-risk assessment. depend quality, risk assessment also help direct resource examination team. altogether, information glean examination audit find current risk assessment directly affect scope examination, include level area transaction test require ass adequacy compliance-risk management program. at institution le satisfactory record, extensive review necessary. federal reserve examination compliance-risk management design gotcha game examiner look one-time breach specific regulation laws. rather, examination design ass adequacy structure process institution us manage compliance risk. examiner expect look big picture look effectiveness program (including policy processes) manage organization's compliance risk. we want understand whether control place manage risk organization. a area risk management, expectation - therefore scope many examination area - frame emphasis on; • board senior management oversight, • policy procedures, • internal controls, • monitor reporting, • training. i'll give sense key component examiner likely look assess fundamental areas. board senior management oversight a successful compliance-risk management program start top organization. it essential board director take lead require top-to-bottom compliance culture incorporate organization's day-to-day operation well communicate senior management staff member understand compliance responsibility role implement enterprise-wide program. examiner look understand board senior management's role set communicate compliance culture within organization. examiner also look see role responsibility clearly define communicate throughout organization senior management staff understand compliance obligations. in order board senior management carry responsibilities, need understand organization's current compliance risks. we see organization experience challenge result lack clarity area grow diversify. examiner determine whether organization effective risk assessment accurately identify compliance risk whether material risk communicate board. effective risk assessment measure risk present clients, product services, geographic exposure within specific business line activity aggregate risk across organization. risk assessment critical ensure board senior management well informed. it also serf foundation risk-based policies, procedures, internal controls. examiner look understand organization's risk-assessment process. for example, look see degree business line involved, frequently risk assessment updated, incorporate new products, services, legal entities. bi review 56/2006 2 human financial resource are, course, critical effective performance. consequently, examiner ass whether senior management ensure compliance program sufficient financial resource sufficient number qualify well-trained staff carry responsibility effectively. policy procedure policy procedure essentially define communicate key goal process organization's compliance program. examiner look see whether policy procedure provide adequate risk identification, assessment, measurement, control. a i mention moment ago, clearly communicate role responsibility characteristic effective compliance program. toward end, examiner also look determine whether policy clearly delineate accountability line authority across organization's activities. examiner also expect see well-defined process ensure compliance risk potential breach identify elevate appropriate level, keep risk organization. procedure well-communicated staff throughout organization. overall, policy procedure must keep current, and, risk assessment, examiner look see whether information glean compliance program operation use tailor compliance policies, procedures, control specifically address inherent environment evolves. internal control internal control particularly crucial element compliance-risk management program. examiner verify whether organization establish implement effective system internal controls, include appropriate report line separation duties, well positive negative incentives. an essential part internal control framework periodic test determine well framework operating, require remedial action taken. the frequency test risk-based involve, appropriate, sample transaction testing, sample size determine volume degree risk activity. examiner carefully ass scope quality test compliance program. part assessment include determine whether test perform appropriate independence. examiner also look understand specific delineation responsibility internal audit, compliance, independent function third parties. these delineation vary organization, role clearly define communicated. examiner also look well compliance-testing exception report senior management resolve business-line management. they ass method track exception exception resolved; assessment include examine organization's provision escalate unresolved exception high level organization, include board directors. independence separation duty also issue importance beyond compliance testing. for example, case large complex bank organization may corporate compliance function, examiner interest understand compliance function maintain independence business line advise compliance requirement implementation require controls. in case compliance function responsibility monitor testing, examiner ass whether procedure establish ensure adequate degree independence objectivity. monitor report a i mentioned, fundamental purpose compliance-risk management program identify, monitor, manage compliance risk effectively. monitor involve identify bi review 56/2006 3 communicate compliance concern appropriate party within organization. monitor report enable senior management board effectively carry respective responsibilities. we see organization silo critical compliance information rather share level organization, handicap organization's ability identify systemic risks. a result, examiner interest whether compliance program design monitor report compliance concerns. the level sophistication bank organizations' monitor activity generally vary accord size complexity organization, examiners' expectation vary accordingly. for example, large complex bank organization typically support information system provide management timely report relate compliance law regulation transaction level. examiner look see whether report generally address monitor test activities, actual potential material compliance deficiency breaches, new change compliance requirements. they also ass whether report design ensure information compliance communicate appropriate level within organization. train train policies, procedures, associate control component compliance-risk management overlooked. examiner determine whether bank organization's train program ensure compliance policies, procedures, control well understand appropriately communicate throughout organization. while depth breadth train employee receive depend employee's role responsibilities, examiner generally ass whether staff level understand organization's compliance culture, general compliance-risk issues, high-level compliance policy procedures. supervisory consistency bank secrecy act a bank organization become complex, consistency agencies' supervisory approach become even critical. the federal reserve view supervisory consistency mean enhance supervision reduce burden. this particularly essential area regulatory compliance, specifically regard compliance bank secrecy act regulations. the federal reserve include review bsa compliance within every full-scope safety-and-soundness examination. for large bank organization subject continuous supervision, federal reserve conduct series target bsa review course supervisory cycle. this, combine off-site monitoring, allow federal reserve maintain current understand bsa compliance within organization subject supervision. on-site examination essential ensure bsa program operate effectively. because complexity bank organization today, number institution may subject supervision increase number regulators. a consistent examination approach among regulator critical order achieve consolidate view risk management within organization, also reduce burden bank organizations. our work federal financial institution examination council develop bank secrecy act/anti-money launder examination manual, release last summer, mark important step forward effort ensure consistent supervision area bsa compliance. through manual, agency emphasize bank organization's responsibility establish implement risk-based policies, procedures, process comply bsa safeguard operation money launder terrorist financing. the agency currently update manual plan release revise version summer. i tell revise manual include update reflect change regulation supervisory guidance course past year, also, among things, additional guidance develop bsa/aml risk assessment, foundation effective risk-based controls. bi review 56/2006 4 hmda data fair lend examination examination evaluate bank organization's adherence fair lend law regulation also routine component consumer compliance examination conduct federal reserve. hmda data play important role examination bank organization require report data. examiner probe data understand bank respond credit need serve community. the data rich many respects. they contain information applicants' borrowers' race ethnicity, sex, income level, property location. and, since 2004, hmda data also include price information certain loan price exceed threshold set board. the hmda data help examiner good focus fair lend examination. particularly bank large portfolios, data, include available price data, incorporate statistical management system analyze lend pattern help direct examination process aspect bank's program may warrant close look. even small bank statistical analysis cannot performed, hmda data use start fair lend review. however, know, hmda data limitations. for example, data include credit-risk factor credit score loan-to-value ratios. because limitations, examination process look additional information lender's practices, particular loans, conclusion drawn. examiner consider - together hmda data - information derive consumer complaints, risk apparent various business lines, adequacy institution's compliance-risk management program. since examiner look data, would advisable bank make review data component comprehensive fair lend compliance program community reinvestment act strategy. in fact, examiner look carefully analysis hmda data perform bank talk bank understand reason disparity lend patterns. the bank probably best position understand hmda data suggest ability reach prospective borrowers. consequently, assessment useful examiner establish fair lend examination scope. examiner want know bank address disparity bank's analysis lead change control make ensure policy followed. i want emphasize that, compliance-risk management programs, breadth bank organization's program system review commensurate size complexity operations, range products, demographic markets. beyond review hmda data, examiner evaluate whether organization's fair lend compliance framework make possible identify, monitor, effectively control risks. examiner look clear articulation board director institution's lend strategy, include define risk parameter execution appropriate risk-measurement risk-mitigation initiatives. examiner evaluate extent management control reflect risk associate institution's lend strategy. a broad area compliance-risk management, examiner look closely compliance culture establish top organization filter everyday responsibility business-line manager manager hold accountable compliance. conclusion because grow complexity bank organizations, federal reserve currently consider whether more-tailored guidance area enterprise-wide compliance-risk management warranted. in come months, continue engage good understand successful approach identifying, monitoring, manage risk across organizations. thank you. bi review 56/2006 5 timothy f geithner: implication growth credit derivative financial stability remark mr timothy f geithner, president chief executive officer

today, i'll focus implication change credit derivative market stability overall financial system. a attempt explore broad implication rapid growth new market, i'll say know know. i'll also highlight

concentration credit risk make easy mitigate, diversification make easy achieve. credit losses, whether specific, individual default widespread distress accompany economic recessions, diffuse broadly across institution different risk appetite tolerance, across geographic borders. our experience since introduction new instrument - period include major asset price shock global recession - seem justify essentially positive judgment likely benefit ongoing growth markets. despite benefit financial resilience, change credit market subject conference also provoke concern unease, even among

further, exposure merit attention may hard measure mature interest rate exchange rate derivatives. the underlie economic exposure involve hard ass part complexity instruments, embed leverage many

productive summit. bi review 55/2006 7 panagiotis thomopoulos: bank regulation europe - brief overview current development speech mr panagiotis thomopoulos, deputy governor bank greece, event organise european bank train network hellenic bank association, athens, 4 may 2006. * * * good evening, lady gentlemen. allow begin welcome athens wish pleasant stay. it great pleasure honour address distinguish audience. i would also like seize opportunity thank european bank train network hellenic bank association organise event participation. my objective today provide brief overview current development bank regulation take shape european “arena”, outline main challenge european regulator supervisor face, degree integration european financial market increases. before present think subject - subject which, i sure, know well - i like say word greece, i comparative advantage. discipline requirement euro area candidacy membership, greece succeed low inflation rate 16% fifteen year almost mid-1990s 3% 2000 onwards. at time, gdp growth rise le 1% first period almost 4% last ten years. the greek economic scene also transform thank advantage derive euro area membership, include stable macroeconomic environment low interest rates. the olympic game host athens 2004 contributed, turn, create favourable environment growth. however, liberalisation privatisations, well reinvigorate private entrepreneurial spirit, principal growth-driving forces. this spirit manifest greece's re-orientation inward- outward-looking economy. we see dynamic part south-east europe, large greek communities, number hundred thousands, take root distant past, continue century play important role economic social life respective countries. the story community go back long way, begin ancient greece, follow 5 century roman empire, continue 1,000 year byzantium. then come nearly 600 year ottoman rule and, recently, communist take-over countries, result expulsion non-communist greeks. after interlude 50 years, historic force back work. more 5,000 greek company operate neighbour balkan country among main foreign investor bulgaria, fyrom, romania, albania and, recently, serbia. this development result delocalisation greek industry neighbour country steady inflow migrant worker greece. the greek bank sector also undergo radical transformation, evolve highly regulate sector 15 year ago, bank greece set 150 different level interest rate become free, competitive dynamic sector key pillar greece’s successful economic performance. despite relatively small size european standards, greek bank ' high profitability enable build sound foundations. just like sectors, greek bank sector also expand south-east europe. this offer greek bank opportunity benefit growth potential rapidly develop region low level financial intermediation, increase size efficiency, continue flourish competitive international financial environment. the market penetration greek banks, base total asset neighbour countries, range 11% 30%. moreover, foreign claim greek commercial bank balkan region country reach almost €11 billion, represent 25% greek banks’ total foreign claim 58% funds. unfortunately, state greek economy far rosy many challenge still lie ahead. after euro area entry, fiscal discipline relax last five year fiscal deficit has, fact, worsened. only year budget fall 3% gdp, continuous effort maintain reach balance position, require eu. bi review 55/2006 1 moreover, euphoria euro area entry prompt '' money illusion '' labour union demand obtain high nominal wage increases, regardless impact real income unemployment, result loss external competitiveness. this make even urgent imperative raise productivity growth develop high value- add activities. we, therefore, need intensify structural adjustment effort labour product markets, promote innovation technology, ease bureaucratic restrictions, recommend lisbon agenda. my personal opinion morass bureaucracy main impediment fast rate growth. the greek bank sector thus face double challenge: apply new regulations, control mechanism risk-based method (basel ii), expand rapidly greece abroad, and, time, risk management internal control point view, rapidly integrate subsidiary branch south-east europe, environment still differ average euro area country. expansion toward potentially much large market - turkey, poland egypt today ukraine tomorrow - call even good internal risk exposure-monitoring systems. this parameter new capital adequacy framework, combination recently establish regulatory framework internal control, deal with. the bank greece, supervisory authority, indeed adapt regulatory supervision apparatus deal new challenges, encourage bank sector maintain high capital adequacy ratio (13% end last year). this provide adequate buff fact uncover non-performing loan still slightly high greece average euro area fact greek bank still benefit favourable cyclical phase and, therefore, yet experience adverse effect slowdown. in parallel, give specificity greece ' bank system economy, bank greece impose strict measure bank (e.g. car much high 8%). likewise, give rapid growth lend household (30% average since 2001), bank greece instruct bank debt-servicing burden household exceed 30-40% disposable household income. while adhere risk-based approach, give individual bank freedom estimate possible loss manage risks, bank greece consider supervisory authority always alert (not say, vigilant) and, necessary, adjust capital requirement individual banks, also periodically test internal control mechanism risk management systems, context pillar iii. only last resort direct measure applied. current development now, get back subject today ' conference: during 1990s, effort financial service sector focus achieve smooth changeover single european currency. however, euro successfully introduced, attention shift improve function single european financial market. the late 1990s saw launch ambitious plan - financial service action plan - , contain series legislative measure would allow european financial service sector gradually realise full potential. since then, major change take still take place financial regulation landscape. the outstanding them, bank sector, forthcoming new capital requirement framework, one final measure eu financial service action plan. the new capital requirement framework the new directive - crd call - make exist bank supervision framework risk-sensitive promote enhance risk management among financial institutions. this improve effectiveness framework ensure financial stability, maintain confidence financial institution support macroeconomic environment general. improve risk-sensitivity capital requirement facilitate effective allocation capital, thus contribute boost competitiveness eu economy. there has, however, discordance opinion certain aspect crd, fortunately largely resolved. the new directive is, fact, new supervisory framework rather revolutionary nature, adapt globalise world live in. apart introduce new approach calculation capital requirements, crd provide establishment intensive cooperation information exchange mechanism among supervisors, option delegate task among supervisors, information exchange requirement among bank supervisors, central bank finance ministry 2 bi review 55/2006 emergency situations, - completely new element - disclosure requirement bank supervisors. of above-mentioned elements, one issue spark much debate and, extent, controversy, allocation supervisory task responsibility home host supervisor, i.e.: (i) authority supervise parent bank (i.e. consolidate supervisor) authority supervise ''significant'' subsidiary bank (ii) supervisor bank locate country origin supervisor locate country ''systemically relevant'' branch established. the main concern debate find right balance, enhance efficiency supervisory arrangements, ensure effectiveness respect exist accountability arrangement national level. the bank greece strong interest outcome debate, actively participates, hope optimum balance reached. needle say, interest also reflect fact bank greece host supervisor incoming eu bank home supervisor outgo greek banks, expand mostly neighbour balkan countries, prepare implement eu framework. in perform roles, mention above, bank greece consistently follow policy encourage european integration process refrain create unnecessary administrative burden erect obstacles, without, course, put effectiveness supervisory task risk. other regulatory initiative • in parallel preparation new supervisory framework ' implementation, discussion way regard revision directive deposit guarantee scheme electronic money directive. • another major issue spark considerable controversy concern so-called supervisory approval process. the debate initially trigger certain market participants, fear obstacle cross-border merger acquisitions. the bank greece central bank many country repeatedly state isolate cases, misuse supervisory power may occurred, generalised. in greece, case eu whole, supervisory authority base decision regard merger acquisition foreign institution domestic bank strictly supervisory criteria. the new decision-making structure financial service apart introduction new capital adequacy framework, another radical change introduce involve decision-making process eu level financial sector, also know lamfalussy process. a new financial service committee architecture established. the lamfalussy approach, originally elaborate security sector, extend bank insurance sector, well. give time constraint, extensive presentation lamfalussy framework would probably inappropriate. however, reason underline main objectives, are: • develop regulation adapt quickly new market development practices, support integration enhance eu competitiveness, • strengthen cross-border cross-sector cooperation among supervisory authority convergence day-to-day supervisory practice implementation. it worth mention new decision-making structure yet reach full potential. on one hand, concern potential proliferation work among various committee work group consequent risk confusion waste resources. on hand, process start yield significant benefits, especially field supervisory convergence, overcompensate negative aspects. bi review 55/2006 3 the committee european bank supervisor (cebs) the cebs, part lamfalussy framework, institutional committee bring together bank supervisor eu country central banks, include ecb, observers. the cebs three main tasks: • provide advice commission; • ensure consistent implementation community legislation bank sector convergence supervisory practices; • promote supervisory cooperation exchange information. the cebs advisory role within eu legislative procedure. the cebs’s focus promote consistent approach bank supervision increase convergence standard practice enhance cooperation information sharing. the ultimate goal build common supervisory culture practical operational network bank supervisor within establish eu legal framework. this particular importance efficient supervision cross-border bank groups, appropriate dissemination information relate risk elimination (if possible) work duplication expect reduce administrative burden cost supervise institutions, reduce strain supervisory resources. this mean benefit small institutions, predominantly domestic even local focus, convergence imply establishment level play field across eu. next step change regulatory framework organisational structure decision-making process necessary sufficient condition realisation eu financial market ' strong growth potential. this easily achieve financial integration accelerated. this belief drive force behind new eu financial service strategy next 5 years, currently discussion among eu institutions, while, time, market participant consulted. up now, element seem part strategy closely relate bank sector completion certain ongoing project (i.e. mortgage credit, consumer credit, new legal framework payments, etc.) undertake new legislative initiative (i.e. investment funds, bank accounts, credit intermediaries). one legislative initiative require special attention proposal directive payment services. the propose directive, part wide single european payment area project, aim establish modern harmonise legal operational framework necessary creation integrate retail payment market, would enable payment make quickly easily throughout eu. the proposal also aim introduce competition payment system facilitate realisation economy scale. this improve efficiency reduce cost payment system economy whole, issue high importance bank greece, electronic payment system much demand greece. future challenge supervisory architecture within eu lately, several discussion revolve around issue eu supervisory architecture, one argument complexity supervisory arrangement increase parallel growth bank group ' cross-border activity. without dismiss concerns, share view conduct cross-border activity connect significant supervisory burden. on contrary, important obstacle expansion cross-border activity bank sector difference tax treatment bank product among different states, cultural difference lack proximity (except case branches). different view supervisory architecture advocate alternative model supervision, range complete centralisation total decentralisation. each approach merits, also raise number complicate strategic operational issue need addressed. 4 bi review 55/2006 i believe way extreme solution adopt instead implement lamfalussy approach, though panacea, definite advantage allow lot flexibility. first all, provide range different degree centralisation regulatory process, would entail le harmonise set rule depend issue need addressed. in way, facilitate swift adaptation community legislation new development financial markets, many case cross-sectoral dimensions. moreover, boost regulatory supervisory convergence time allow efficient handle difference arise fact vast majority 8,000 credit institution eu operate domestically sometimes even locally, market diverse characteristic good assess local supervisors, history last 50 year teach us. in context, i think go long way lamfalussy framework. and i think anywhere near stage say fully exploit possibility offer, least bank sector. in addition, lamfalussy framework way apply evolve time response evolution markets. the eurosystem’s perspective i would like conclude speech specific reference eurosystem's perspective above-mentioned regulatory developments. it worth note eurosystem's primary relevant concern stem fact responsible monitor financial stability euro area, time recognise smooth-functioning financial system vital transmission mechanism ecb monetary policy. within context, forthcoming implementation new capital requirement framework, well strengthen supervisory cooperation within eu, see particularly encourage developments, considerably enhance exist financial stability framework. of course, financial market landscape change degree european financial integration increases, new concern likely arise, regarding, instance, ability system whole respond possible emergency situation timely effective manner. the bank greece, member eurosystem, keep close eye developments, participate actively respective discussion within eu institution establishment common arrangements. bi review 55/2006 5 mark w olson: home mortgage disclosure act testimony mr mark w olson, member board governor u federal reserve system, subcommittee financial institution consumer credit, committee financial services, u house representatives, washington dc, 13 june 2006. * * * chairman bachus, representative sanders, member subcommittee, i please discus us significance home loan data collected, reported, publicly disclose home mortgage disclosure act. the act, i refer hmda, enact thirty year ago. since then, undergo major changes. today, hmda require home lenders, substantial majority home loan market, disclose select information application receive loan extend year. this information use least three purposes: first, help public judge well lender meet housing-credit need communities; second, facilitate efficient investment house neighborhoods; third, enhance enforcement law prohibit discrimination lending. hmda promote goal disclosure rather substantive mandate restrictions. the act direct lender make loan particular area persons. nor direct lender make particular kind loan refrain particular loan term practices. instead, hmda prescribe lender disclosure that, take together, form public data set lend patterns. every reportable application loan occupy unique line data set. in 2005, approximately 31 million report loan applications. the information disclose application include race, ethnicity, income applicant, type amount loan apply for, whether loan originate application denied, census tract property financed. for public’s convenience, summary report data publish metropolitan area institution - almost 9,000 depository nondepository institutions. these summary report compile federal reserve board behalf agency member federal financial institution examination council (ffiec). the board also process edit transaction-level data, ffiec make available member public, may analyze compile data see fit. the information disclose hmda constitute rich data set, but, course, data set limitations. the hmda data tell great deal lend patterns, tell entire story. nonetheless, draw attention lend patterns, data prompt discussion, investigation, analysis, research may deepen understand pattern occur allow u increase fairness efficiency home loan market. for example, 1991, congressional amendment hmda result disclosure data that, first time, reveal black hispanic applicant mortgage loan far likely non-hispanic white applicant application denied. the publication data precipitate important public discussion underlie cause - whether unlawful discrimination one causes. that discussion help bring new initiative compliance community development. many lender improve lend policy develop strong compliance oversight programs. lender also expand outreach underserved communities, often strengthen tie community-based organizations. the data also prompt supervisory enforcement agency improve fair lend oversight programs. in short, though denial disparity persisted, hmda’s disclosure disparity help increase fairness efficiency home loan market. last year pass another hmda milestone first loan-level information mortgage loan price released. the public discussion release data prompt reminiscent discussion take place initial release loan-denial data fifteen year ago. today, focus discussion shift consumer get home loan term consumer get home loan - essential concern possible role illegal discrimination same. i believe current public discussion new data ultimately goal fairness efficiency mortgage market prompt additional research, enhance compliance enforcement efforts, more-effective investment community development financial literacy. bi review 55/2006 1 the federal reserve responsibility relate areas. in testimony today, i discus four role federal reserve relate hmda data. first, federal reserve board entrust congress write implement rule hmda. act capacity, board require lender report loan-price data. second, supervisor financial institutions, federal reserve us hmda data, include price data, facilitate supervision institution compliance law prohibit discrimination home lending. third, research institution, federal reserve conduct publish analysis price data, encourage research party well. fourth, federal reserve support effort organization use hmda data identify financial education community development needs. the federal reserve also support effort respond needs. the board’s decision collect price information a i said, board regulation, adopt authority hmda, require lender disclose loan-price data. i provide background board’s decision amend regulation include price data. advance information process technology expand access credit homeownership opportunity consumers. in past, individual seek credit purchase home, seek borrow reason, either meet specific underwrite criterion particular loan product; did, everyone pay price product. today, part advance credit score underwrite technology, lender price loan accord risk, charge different borrower different price basis borrower’s estimate creditworthiness. the enhance ability lender ass credit risk give rise segment mortgage market often refer subprime lending. in subprime market, higher-risk borrower pay high prices. subprime lend grow rapidly, le 5 percent mortgage lend 1994 estimate 20 percent 2005, $600 billion. the wide range loan price available subprime market help expand consumers’ homeownership opportunity increase access home equity. but price variability raise concern unequal treatment borrowers. it also raise concern whether certain loan term lend practice appropriate, whether consumer ability knowledge shop beneficial loan terms, whether subprime market sufficiently competitive. the board respond concern amend regulation c, regulation implement hmda, expand available data higher-priced lending. the data release ffiec september 2005, cover lend activity 2004, contain first loan-level information loan price ever available general public. the data contain price information loan whose price exceed threshold set board. the threshold select target segment home loan market raise concern, take consideration cost burden reporting. the threshold generally correspond unofficial line separate prime subprime markets. but line separation always clear, correspondence report threshold event imprecise. therefore, call loan whose price exceed report threshold "higher-priced loans" rather "subprime loans." this second year price data publicly available board’s regulation. the board continue monitor effect regulation effort understand benefit costs. the federal reserve’s use hmda data fair lend supervision i speak federal reserve’s role agency charge implement hmda regulations. the federal reserve also role supervisor bank hold company state-chartered bank member federal reserve system. in role, federal reserve long use hmda data help supervise financial institutions’ compliance fair lend laws. the new data higher-priced loan yet another "screen" make fair lend supervision effective. the federal reserve also share analysis 2004 price data supervisory enforcement agency assist oversight institution supervise. before i discus hmda screen fit process fair lend supervision, i want describe process generally. fair lend review integral part federal 2 bi review 55/2006 reserve’s supervision consumer compliance perform regularly within examination cycle. in addition, examiner may conduct target fair lend review whenever circumstance warrant. moreover, federal reserve examine institutions’ compliance fair lend law regardless whether report price data hmda. indeed, federal reserve examine potential price discrimination well adopt hmda price-reporting requirement. although price report hmda limit higher-priced loans, examiner look unlawful price discrimination price level. furthermore, examiner seek detect form discrimination, underwrite discrimination (for example, deny credit basis applicant’s race) redline (for example, deny credit basis racial characteristic applicant’s neighborhood). federal reserve examiner use institution’s hmda data, include accept-deny data loan application price data may report originations, conjunction information institution determine focus institution’s fair lend examination. the hmda data incorporate statistical management system produce analysis lend pattern aid examination process. start 2005, analysis incorporate loan-price data. other information examiner use include consumer complaints, likely risk institution’s different business lines, adequacy institution’s compliance-risk management system. to gauge risk price discrimination, examiner consider, among type information, presence broad employee broke discretion price relationship, any, price compensation loan officer brokers. when examiner determine fair lend examination focus pricing, collect additional information institution evaluate whether price disparity fully attribute legitimate factor whether due, even part, unlawful discrimination. if unlawful discrimination found, institution refer department justice department house urban development, require law. depend outcome referral nature violation, federal reserve may also take action fully resolve matter. for example, federal reserve may direct institution provide remedy harm party improve fair lend compliance control policies. a federal reserve state repeatedly, use price hmda data effectively supervisory process depend full understand inherent limitation data. the hmda data include valuable information, applicant borrower income, loan amount, location property financed, data include many factor lender routinely consider loan underwrite pricing. some typical credit-risk factor include hmda data credit score loan-to-value ratios. because hmda data lack information, cannot conclude hmda data alone observe racial ethnic difference price loan result unlawful discrimination. that federal reserve examiner consider additional information lender, include information loan product lend practice borrowers’ creditworthiness, draw conclusion lender’s compliance record. in addition improve fair lend supervision enforcement government agencies, new price data spur institution improve compliance. although examiner long consider institutions’ mortgage price part fair lend review process, public disclosure price data appear give additional impetus institutions’ compliance efforts. many institution reexamine price policy procedure ensure permit, even inadvertently, price difference violate fair lend laws. many institution also reevaluate control ensure proper policy followed. this increase attention institution fair lend compliance one principal benefit hmda. research federal reserve staff others supervision fair lend compliance deal lend pattern institution level. but hmda data also reveal lend pattern aggregate levels, across institutions. disclosure aggregate pattern raise focus attention important policy question concern access credit. to end, researcher federal reserve publish numerous paper articles. bi review 55/2006 3 most recently, staff publish article pattern new loan-pricing data.1 i review findings. first, home lender make few, any, higher-priced loans. in 2004, 500 8,850 report institution make 100 higher-priced loans; ten lender large volume higher-priced loan account 40 percent loans. (the ffiec finish reviewing, processing, edit 2005 data, submit march year.) the 2004 data also show 16 percent borrower take higher-priced loan year nation whole. this proportion may increase 2004 2005. for loans, board’s regulation us long-term interest rate set threshold report loan-price data, mortgage loan rate closely track short-term rates. thus, narrow difference short-term long-term rates, occur 2004 2005, may increase proportion loan report higher-priced loans. the proportion borrower obtain higher-priced loan geographically uniform vary widely region city. for example, many metropolitan area south southwest, 30 percent 40 percent homebuyers take conventional loan 2004 take higher-priced loans. in area country, proportion much smaller. these difference may surprise - data show credit score tend low average south southwest elsewhere - may nonetheless warrant analysis. of course, public attention focus notable variation incidence higher-priced lend across racial ethnic lines: black hispanic much likely non-hispanic white receive higher-priced loans. in 2004, 32 percent black borrower 20 percent hispanic borrower receive higher-priced home purchase loans, 9 percent non-hispanic white borrower did. in words, black homebuyers receive higher-priced loan three time often non-hispanic white homebuyers, hispanic homebuyers receive higher-priced loan twice often non-hispanic whites. certainly, difference magnitude disturb raise important public policy questions. they also lead conclude racial discrimination must play role price home loans. however, reason i explain above, cannot use hmda data alone judge whether institution discriminate unlawfully or, therefore, whether unlawful discrimination present market. despite limitations, hmda data supply key insight aggregate disparities: reflect part segmentation market race ethnicity. black hispanic borrower likely obtain mortgage loan institution tend specialize subprime lending. now, least part segmentation market race ethnicity may reflect objective difference borrowers’ preference difference credit-risk indicators, credit scores, include hmda data. yet segmentation may trouble causes, least part. segmentation may stem borrower steer lender charge high price warrant credit characteristic borrowers. borrower may also different level financial literacy, knowledge mortgage lend process may uneven - example, may understand importance shop negotiate best loan terms. additional research need explore these, perhaps other, hypotheses. the board continue conduct promote research explore racial ethnic difference incidence higher-priced lending. in june july, board conduct hear home equity lend market. these hearings, i chairing, intend gather information about, among things, consumer select lender loans. the board’s 2007 biennial community development research conference also provide forum research may help explain difference incidence higher-priced lending. 1 robert b. avery, glenn b. canner, robert e. cook (2005), "new information report hmda it application fair lend enforcement," federal reserve bulletin, vol. 91 (summer 2005), pp. 344-394. 4 bi review 55/2006 the federal reserve’s promotion community development financial literacy i discuss federal reserve’s role regulation, supervision, research. now i turn role promote community development financial literacy. the federal reserve system us hmda data help banks, community organizations, interest group identify community development need opportunities. for example, federal reserve bank boston tabulate hmda data new england region help regional financial institutions, community organizations, state local government access use information area’s regional lend patterns. in addition, community

jump$tart coalition, operation hope, dollarwi$e campaign conference mayors. in parallel effort, federal reserve bank support similar regional initiatives. the federal reserve also collaborate group research develop successful financial education program identify effective way deliver program intend audiences. by means, federal reserve seek address gap consumers’ understand home loan transaction also financial management broadly. these gap consumer understand may contribute disparity availability price home loans. in closing, i appreciate opportunity discus federal reserve’s regulation require lender disclose price data home loans; federal reserve us data improve fair lend supervision; federal reserve’s promotion research, community development, financial literacy. bi review 55/2006

invest unite state scale capital formation markets. the apparent robustness market activity innovation face fairly substantial change legal, supervisory enforcement environment encouraging. but cumulate effect may take year manifest fully. therefore, official community attentive risk balance wrong. bi review 54/2006 1 i think i might outline broad principle guide official community apply exist body regulation supervisory guidance, refine current proposals, design future changes. it imperative get right. the efficiency, dynamism resilience financial system strategic asset u.s. economy. the relatively favorable performance u.s. financial system result wisdom past choice make foster open competitive financial system, also result good fortune special advantage come unique role unite state dollar world economy financial system. some relative advantage likely decline time maturation deregulation financial market around world. and healthy evolution prompt u even attentive potential risk cost impose financial institution market company want raise capital market become prohibitively high. here consideration principle i believe guide u official community strive improve regulatory framework go forward. i want emphasize principles, case many principles, easy state achieve. let start acknowledge aspect exact standard seek impose financial system turn expensive relation return public policy objective. and provision seem optimally design give time likely need evolve condition change. that occur natural aspect dynamic financial environment. there area likely err prescriptive others leave much room discretion judgment. it would good could find way build initial design guidance regulation capacity quick continuous evolution learn more. second, need continue adapt approach imperative much integrate global financial system. global integration, course, give u great stake quality supervision outside borders. this pragmatic interest lead u spend progressively resource attention international dimension work. this recognition inform effort lead basel capital accord, lamfalussy standard payment settlement system many international cooperative efforts. but imperative much strong today much great extent financial integration, likely grow. it also important design regulatory initiative unite state inform careful assessment relative impact u.s. institution markets. effective solution many concern face national financial system require multilateral approaches. rather start presumption act unite state hope induce world follow, area effective approach start borderless solution i mean one design apply class institution financial instruments, independent geography currency. where prove possible term time frame like, course preserve option move alone. third, live financial system nonbank financial institution play much large role past, system difference activity bank-centered financial institution nonbanks diminished, large commercial bank investment bank compete nonbank institution unite state abroad. these change market structure many positive implication financial efficiency stability, also mean difference size nature incentive face institution different supervisory regulatory regime large competitive effects. the result opportunity regulatory arbitrage potential reduce impact provision apply regulate supervise institutions. the risk regulate core system simply push financial activity periphery raise risk distress among nonbanks cause great damage financial system. this mean look way cooperate closely supervisor across functional line supervision system way impact incentive broad range market participants. fourth, need find way accelerate pace regulatory framework evolve meet new challenges. the increase pace change financial innovation market structure require great agility among supervisor regulators. without agility risk lag far behind change frontier risk. this mean innovation need meet 2 bi review 54/2006 regulatory response. that would unfortunate surely counterproductive impulse encourage regulation. but problem exist framework significant implication financial stability efficiency, need flexibility expertise require act quickly able area past. fifth, need creative identify area market-led initiatives, rather new laws, regulation formal supervisory guidance, likely successful possibly efficient achieve certain policy objectives. where collective action problem limit incentive ability individual institution make necessary investment infrastructure, official sector facilitate motivate cooperative effort among market participant solve problem. at times, may effective help convene group market participant reach consensus best practice common solution would define impose solution ourselves. of course, problem amenable solution public support private initiative, open type approach likely successful achieve objectives. and sixth, careful necessary constructive attention devote past several year meet control compliance challenge detract classic safety soundness requirement risk management. these compete priorities. the financial cost reputational damage associate compliance control failure large. and investment internal control infrastructure—in audit corporate governance change control financial reporting—are crucial part foundation credible risk management framework. but need make sure demand ever evolve challenge manage credit market risk receive degree attention senior management board commensurate risks. and balance need reflect focus supervisory efforts, well. these classic prudential issues, make critical difference reduce vulnerability market systemic risk, need principal focus supervisory attention. this time i believe important encourage care conservatism discipline risk management. there three area top hierarchy concerns. first, important major dealer make investment necessary improve operational infrastructure underpin credit derivative broad over-the-counter (otc) derivative market. operational risk infrastructure failure play prominent role past financial crises, infrastructure weakness characterize credit derivative market since inception another credible source concern. the major market participants, dealer traditional nontraditional investors, process improve infrastructure support markets. the change underway clean backlog unconfirmed trades, automate entire post-trade-processing environment, improve settlement process event default help reduce operational risk derivative market reduce source uncertainty could exacerbate market shock. we encourage progress make date continue encourage improvements. second, believe major dealers, well large commercial investment banks, take cold, hard look finance condition margin practice, particularly respect hedge fund counterparties otc derivatives. the report issue counterparty risk management policy group i ii make important observation financial system likely resilient condition stress counterparties set initial margin level likely sustainable le benign conditions. when margin level set conservatively, firm likely flexibility respond stress le likely take action might amplify market shock exacerbate reduction liquidity. when competitive pressure drive margin down, market may le resilient. third, believe major financial institution need continue improve capacity measure exposure risk le benign market economic environment experience recent years. the discipline stress test scenario analysis design measure tail risk frontier challenge. senior management board director need understand limitation tool use ass risks, try good understand potential scale loss firm may face, carefully examine well risk exposure reflect overall risk appetite firm, size capital liquidity cushion maintain relation exposures. bi review 54/2006 3 i want conclude observation requirement effective risk management control regime likely become rather le demand time. those charge manage major financial institution need continue make investment necessary stay abreast change get close frontier possible. this reality make even important supervisory community continue look way address aspect exist supervisory regime impose unnecessary cost burden pull resource attention away potential source risk financial system. thank you. 4 bi review 54/2006 zhou xiaochuan: remark china’s trade balance exchange rate summary remark mr zhou xiaochuan, governor people’s bank china, issue relate china’s trade balance exchange rate, china development forum sponsor development research center state council, beijing, 20 march 2006. * * * analysis china’s trade surplus 1. the process globalization, cross-border outsource restructure supply chain accelerate recent years, support it revolutionary progress improvement infrastructures. it become possible outsource activity would difficult outsource foreign country past. 2. there time lag change layout competitive advantages. some labor-intensive production activity service usually outsource develop nation like china india, take certain period time develop country (where production cost high) could create new job develop new export advantages. trade imbalance could expand period time lag. 3. fdi (particularly, mncs) play dominant role cross-border outsource china change landscape trade balance. china grow re-export process center mainly foreign-funded enterprises, supply chain increasingly expand value-added steadily enlarged. exchange rate elasticity production trade fairly small. 4. from 1998 2004, china’s foreign trade relatively keep balance, annual trade surplus average us$20 billion us$30 billion. however, trade surplus suddenly escalate us$100 billion 2005, could mainly attribute slow growth import contrast steady growth export (in 2005, export register growth 28.4 percent import increase 17.6 percent). the slow growth import mainly cause decline import growth equipments, factor relate structural adjustment chinese economy. 5. fdi (particularly, mncs) drastically increase production sale china, substitute china’s imports. there numerous foreign brand foreign-designed product sell chinese market, large part product actually produce fdi company china. china’s exchange rate regime reform 6. china conduct successful reform rmb exchange rate regime july 21, 2005, objective positive response international community. 7. the policy analysis forecast conduct reform produce different view reform impact, therefore, need time observe collect data ass confirm impact exchange rate reform domestic economy employment etc. 8. six month reform, chinese enterprise adapt smoothly reform undertake painful restructuring, however sector suffer severely exchange rate adjustment. on count, may conclude market force could allow gradually play great role float exchange rate. 9. over past eight months, great effort make china cultivate develop foreign exchange markets. trade product enrich market, risk hedge instrument like forward swap developed, market maker otc transaction introduce inter-bank foreign exchange market. the chinese enterprise financial institution need time learn adapt change foreign exchange market, could good position keep line flotation exchange rate. 10. over past eight months, china decontrol unnecessary foreign exchange restrictions. action take respect include relaxation control impose foreign exchange retain use foreign exchange capital account enterprises, facilitation foreign bi review 54/2006 1 exchange use individual current account, exercise apply comprehensive management foreign exchange position hold banks. through efforts, foreign exchange market objectively reflect relationship supply demand foreign exchange. gradualist approach shock therapy? 11. due accelerate development globalization, cross-border outsource adjustment supply chain mention before, likely take several year global trade could reach new equilibrium. china large develop economy heavy employment pressure still fragile financial system, could adopt gradualist approach adjust economy controllable manner. 12. the imf recently hold conference discus global imbalances, participant believe appropriate pursue gradual adjustment, radical measure could result unanticipated consequences. besides, participant suggest u slow make internal adjustment. 13. some advisor prescribe “shock therapy” russia eastern european countries, late describe “shock therapy”. we cautious offer prescription again, credibility jeopardized. china consider take gradualist reform approach win trust mass chinese people, rather “shock”, mention u take lead use “shock” adjust imbalances. global imbalance role exchange rate 14. the chinese government already start apply mix policy measures, include expand domestic demand, low save rate, open market, float exchange rate increase import, improve balance payments. with implementation policy measures, pbc anticipate need time span 2-3 year achieve approximate trade balance. however, worrisome that, accord analysis chinese economists, even china basically realize global trade balance, unite state might still incur large trade deficit would still difficult achieve bilateral trade balance china us. so ball would actually china’s court. 15. the u china make joint effort address trade imbalance two countries. when chinese government make effort mention try relieve problem, complaint also hear u slow take concrete measure reduce twin deficit improve save rate. 16. some u economist assume exchange rate key fix trade imbalance, chinese side economist different school also tend believe assumption. however, assumption fail statistical test use trade data real effective exchange rate record china years. besides, empirical knowledge many country also support judgment. therefore, cautious rely solely excessively exchange rate function realize current account balance. 17. accord article agreement imf, “member country shall right choose exchange rate regime, either free floating, manage float fix exchange rate, discretion”. in sense, exist exchange rate regime label “manipulating exchange rate”. china’s gradual shift relatively fix arrangement exchange rate regime great flexibility line need economic reform open extensive support world community, criticism wrongly accuse action “manipulating exchange rate” widely accepted. 18. china’s trade balance assess within time framework number years, single year. and relevant statistic support view china gain trade advantage exchange rate. japan record large trade surplus continuously many years, yet notion yen exchange rate manipulate accepted. 2 bi review 54/2006 the duality save gap trade imbalance 19. save gap equal difference save investment, trade imbalance equal difference export import. macroeconomics describe duality relationship them. excess save result trade surplus, vice versa. therefore, important view problem trade imbalance perspective savings. 20. there many different reason behind high save rate china. some relate economic transition process others associate social, cultural traditional characteristics. besides, crowd effect fdi domestic investment likely increase excess save china. 21. the chinese government work broad perspective well policy initiative strategy consistent national condition expand internal demand, particularly consumption demand. it also need certain period time realize adjustment. 22. the high save rate large stock foreign reserve asia relate asian financial crisis. many asian complain hedge fund u crisis, also disappoint insufficient role slow policy response imf crisis. these factor make country household asia rely prevent risks. 23. save rate u go extreme. both u china need make effort level domestic demand save rate, otherwise, would difficult resolve trade imbalance. we view certain priority give orchestrate structural adjustments, function exchange rate much expected. foreign exchange reserve 24. after exchange rate regime reform july 21, 2005, time lag reform could expect impact development current account balance fdi china, speculative factor also unlikely leave right away. under manage float exchange rate regime, pbc gradually reduce manage role foreign exchange market line situation, lead slow growth foreign reserves. 25. after asian financial crisis, emerge new view discussion regard set high level rational foreign exchange reserve holding. these development also relate severe shock experience lesson learn crisis hit countries. 26. if two comparable country different size external debt different stock fdi, foreign reserve hold level. external debt need repaid, fdi entail dividend remittance may even withdraw. besides, speculative hot money, existed, could also seize opportunity exit time. all factor bear influence quantitative level foreign reserve holding. if measure per caput level, china’s foreign reserve high. wto rule 27. the wto mechanism establish game rule multilateral basis enable member win; also win-win game china us. although member may dispute regard imbalances, least give room difference resolve negotiations. if anybody design lose-lose game u china, hurt countries, designer dilemma whether game go not. thus choose play win-win game free trade anti-protectionism. bi review 54/2006 3 baboo r

i must say outset i please kpmg’s initiative host seminar, come surprise give firm closely associate bank sector auditor banks. but firm also need commend first among audit firm organize seminar basel ii local bank industry audit profession. first, word set reason basel ii. the capital accord 1988, refer basel i, major step forward far embody principle regulatory capital requirement base risk take individual bank. important regard, basel i rather crude method assign fix risk weight particular assets, fail capture responsiveness capital requirement risk. in world become increasingly prone serious risk systemic failure, illustrate east asian crisis subsequent event include ltcm crisis, risk-sensitive comprehensive framework assess bank capital adequacy call for, especially large internationally active bank involve complex transactions. after many year discussion several round consultation, include non g-10 countries, basel committee come new framework principle supervise large complex bank institutions. this become know basel ii. the core objective basel ii promote stability financial system set parameter base safe sound operation banks. by definition, financial intermediary take different level risk manage differently other. bank remain heart system financial intermediation, whether individual country international level. a such, safety soundness implication financial stability, consumer financial services, bank across board, regulator entire economies. in simple language, basel ii set therefore rigorous framework tie amount capital bank require maintain specific risk measurement risk management capability much capital see last line defence bank recourse event unexpected loss risk-taking. even though basel ii intend originally provide capital adequacy framework internationally active banks, clear that, diverse reasons, number country bank various size importance, would eventually embrace principle determination capital adequacy. several option –

christian noyer: recent development policy challenge affect large-value retail payment system europe speech mr christian noyer, governor bank france, high-level international conference “central bank 21st century”, host bank spain, madrid, 8-9 june 2006. * * * it great pleasure madrid share think recent development policy challenge affect payment system europe. indeed structural change underway europe significant positive bear efficiency safety payment infrastructures, notably wake implementation target2 sepa projects. both project part overall process lisbon agenda aim make european union “the competitive dynamic knowledge-driven economy 2010”. however, europe reach objective field payment systems, number collective challenge addressed, private actor public authorities. those challenge range redefinition private actor boundary cooperation competition, adjustment public authority legal regulatory environment payment system operate. in context, eurosystem’s central bank key role play, give statutory task promote smooth function payment system euro. i first review key issue face europe field payment infrastructures. then, i discus current possible future role eurosystem’s central bank play field. 1. key issue field payment infrastructure today the three main issue i see regard payment infrastructure today europe could summarise follow : (1) role payment infrastructure support european financial integration? (2) which place give technological progress field payment systems? (3) how ensure business continuity payment systems? 1.1. support european financial integration the share payment system money transfer financial intermediary nearly 80%, versus 20% traditional correspondent bank arrangements. so, payment system essential financial sector whole and, therefore, consider key enabler process european financial integration. such contribution payment system financial integration embody target2 sepa projects. both project aim harmonisation consolidation european “network” payment infrastructures. while large-value payment system already attain high level integration progress launch target2, retail payment system still fragmented. in segment large-value payment systems, degree integration increase quickly. the rationale set two european-wide payment system currently exist, i.e. target euro 1, clearly face challenge emu. target2, due go live end 2007, improve degree integration wholesale payment infrastructure represent major step forward consolidation. it provide user fully harmonise settlement service price across europe, support single share platform. an important issue consideration target2, “backbone” euro market infrastructure euro, best contribute integration consolidation security settlement system go interact. should target2, announce eurosystem implement system’s specifications, support wide range interaction bi review 53/2006 1 mode order foster competition system let market force select efficient one (i.e. so-called prohibition compulsion principle) ? or target2 influence selection process limit interaction mode one long-term perspective? it go without say latter case eurosystem, give statutory responsibilities, select efficient interaction model, namely model settlement cash securities, real time case u instance, integrate single platform. in segment retail payment systems, situation quite different. retail infrastructure still separate national border characterize high degree diversity. a number local payment system concentrate clear settlement retail national transactions. in addition, execution cross-border payment go several dedicate arrangement international card schemes, bank “clubs” eba’s step 2 system. the sepa project aim put end fragmentation introducing, 2008, european payment instrument go replace national one end-2010. the vision end-2010 retail payment euro carry easily, efficiently safely across europe within national borders. for vision become reality, key enabler retail payment infrastructure become interoperable consolidate. the outcome thesis change retail payment system uncertain. it may lead various structures, range natural monopoly exercise one infrastructure would encompass national cross-border payment flows, competition several systems. however, whatever structure, challenge find right balance two objectives: (1) reap economy scale scope (2) foster competitive market condition behaviours. 1.2. keep pace technological progress the second issue payment infrastructure consist keep pace technological progress. payment system make it networks, hardware software. a consequence, technological progress key driver enhance way payment system designed, operate used. i highlight significant example recent technological developments. the first half ninety experience major transformation design large-value payment system widespread introduction real-time gross settlement (rtgs) systems. in second step, advance information technology make possible new design like call “hybrid systems”, i.e. system settle real-time but, time, minimise liquidity need thank highly sophisticate optimisation mechanisms. in short, advance information technology allow large-value payment system settle faster, low amount liquidity low cost. on retail payment side, technological progress also allow safety efficiency gain beyond resulted, instance, implementation cheque truncation expect introduction emv (europay mastercard visa) technology card payments. innovation definitely important role play order keep sepa project future-oriented promote use new delivery channel retail payment like internet mobile devices, new type service like electronic invoicing. however, flow innovation come together entry payment market new actor always offer level security traditional supplier services, namely credit institutions. there obviously trade-off between, one hand, encourage innovation facilitate access payment market and, hand, ensure safety payment provide set prudential requirement suppliers. this challenge heart current discussion “proposal directive payment service internal market”. 1.3. ensure business continuity the third key issue i see relate business continuity. business continuity define set measure aim ensure continuity service various incident scenario failure infrastructure component, unavailability staff charge operate systems. business continuity progressively emerge key issue consider design payment infrastructures. in addition, several factor recently lead overhaul approach 2 bi review 53/2006 operational risk: spread real-time process within payment systems, grow complexity technologies, increase interdependence payment system materialisation risk terrorism power breakdowns. all stakeholder - public authority charge regulation oversight, operator user infrastructure – identify weakness regard current practices. for example, incident scenario impact wide geographic area overlooked. in europe, broad consensus need strengthen business continuity requirements. the ultimate objective clear: business continuity contribute enhance soundness financial system whole. but obvious renew business continuity procedures. among challenge take up, i see two major ones: (1) far go without put stake cost efficiency systems? (2) how ensure necessary coherence effort undertake stakeholder different importance, submit different type regulations, across different financial centre compose financial system euro? 2. what role eurosystem the eurosystem quite active field payment system likely develop involvement three role of: (1) service provider, (2) facilitator market regulatory evolution, (3) overseer. 2.1. provide payment service a service provider, eurosystem put priority enhance efficiency safety target system, launch target2 project. target2 provide harmonise service prices, efficient liquidity management settlement mechanisms, set new benchmark term business continuity. the eurosystems objective promote use real-time settlement service central bank money, give expect social benefit term risk reduction payment process. in field retail payments, degree eurosystem’s central banks’ operational involvement vary across countries. most central bank provide payment service public institutions. some central bank also offer process facility commercial bank participate private retail payment system and/or operate retail payment system. the completion sepa project call specific effort central bank significantly involve retail payment operations. they lead example, notably supply new european payment instrument client ensure retail payment system operate comply interoperability principle enshrine sepa project. 2.2. act facilitator market regulatory evolution turn involvement eurosystem payment system issue facilitator market regulatory evolutions, fair say mode action mainly use field retail payment support sepa project. the sepa project launch 2002 european bank community aegis eurosystem european commission. the bank industry take responsibility deliver sepa products, particular specification new european instruments. the european commission, grant great importance sepa project far latter contribute achievement common market completion lisbon agenda, elaborate legal framework payment service european union. it make public, december 2005, directive proposal adopt european level transpose national law 2008. since 1999, eurosystem’s central bank actively promoting, european national levels, establishment sepa. they propose vision share stakeholders, contribute constructive review bank community’s deliverable cooperate european commission address legal regulatory impediments. while design phase sepa project almost completed, next challenge ensure migration towards sepa well-organised delivered. because start point bi review 53/2006 3 country different, migration plan sepa primarily organise locally. this naturally lead involvement eurosystem’s central bank national level, least help coordinate effort wide range stakeholders. for example, banque de france french bank federation create national committee dedicate implementation sepa. this committee gather representative banks, different category user – public administration, corporates, retail business citizen – well member french parliament. it charge coordinate work relate migration towards sepa. have hold first meet april 2006, committee foresee adopt french migration plan october. 2.3. oversee payment system a overseers, central bank eurosystem also contribute objective european financial integration, technological progress high resilience financial system. so far, contribution consist develop apply oversight framework retail payment systems, contribute establish safety efficiency guideline expect integration consolidation retail payment system context sepa project. the need payment systems’ regulatory framework keep pace structural change underway europe likely lead eurosystem’s central bank develop involvement overseers, least two directions. the first direction update exist oversight requirement new market realities. work already start respect. for instance, eurosystem currently revise oversight standard systemically important payment system relate operational risk. this discussion initiative order strengthen business continuity management take place mostly national level systematically consider financial system euro operate euro area-wide network interrelate markets, market infrastructure participants. therefore, eurosystem prepare revise version business continuity expectation systemically important payment system integrate soon oversight policy framework. the transformation payment infrastructure landscape europe also logically lead update oversight framework retail payment systems. in particular, retail payment system become interoperable face consolidation process, likely lead establishment link systems. such link may potentially imply spill risk one system another. central bank make oversight function evolve accordingly. oversight standard certainly include link systems, already case security settlement systems. the second direction evolution oversight activity eurosystem extension scope oversight framework european payment instrument currently make associate clear settlement systems. investigation currently underway elaborate oversight framework card payments. conclude remark payment systems, significant contributor broad effectiveness stability financial system, currently expose europe specific structural change notably result pressure progress towards financial integration euro area. integration consolidation payment system make progress, remain line expectation term safety. however, progress need made, notably field retail payment service infrastructures. in perspective, eurosystem’s central bank continue significantly contribute evolutions, i believe market force likely primary engine progress. 4 bi review 53/2006 toshihiko fukui: recent economic financial development conduct monetary policy summary speech mr toshihiko fukui, governor bank japan, japan national press club, tokyo, 20 june 2006. * * * introduction japan's economy continue grow, domestic external demand also corporate household sector well balance. the economy likely achieve sustainable growth price stability. today, i explain background economic outlook ass several risk factor influence outlook. moreover, base review, i talk bank conduct monetary policy view achieve sustainable growth price stability. i. outlook economic activity price i first summarize outlook economic activity prices. the bank present projection economic activity price two year ahead fiscal 2007 outlook economic activity price (hereafter outlook report) release april 28, 2006: japan's economy likely experience sustain period expansion, domestic external demand also corporate household sector well balance, year-on-year rate increase consumer price index (cpi; exclude fresh food, nationwide basis) likely rise gradually. the outlook report point follow four factor mechanism behind projection. first, export likely continue increase reflect global economic expansion. second, corporate performance likely continue strong. third, positive influence corporate sector strength household sector likely become stronger. and fourth, financial condition likely remain extremely accommodative. examine data available publication outlook report, development economic activity price far seem line projection outlook report. a economic activity fiscal 2005, basis projection fiscal 2006 2007, confirm economy continue grow balance external demand domestic demand particularly private sector. real gdp register annualized growth rate 3.1 percent january-march quarter 2006 3.2 percent fiscal 2005. corporate performance continue strong, evident increase profit manufacture nonmanufacturing sector book close fiscal 2005, follow large gain previous fiscal year. in situation, business fix investment manufacture nonmanufacturing sector show robust growth january-march quarter 2006, show quarterly financial statement statistic corporation industry. a future development economic activity, corporate sector likely remain strong. major firm expect enjoy continue profit growth fiscal 2006, manufacture sector likely particularly strong process industries, electrical machinery, general machinery, automobiles, nonmanufacturing sector industry relate private consumption, retail services. various survey indicate firms' business fix investment plan also relatively strong. we expect strength corporate sector continue, growth business fix investment gradually slow. i elaborate later. the positive influence strength corporate sector household sector become evident. a employment wages, labor market condition improve whole. the unemployment rate recently decline around 4 percent 5-6 percent level 2003, ratio job offer applicant exceed 1.00 first time since 1992. in addition increase number part-time workers, number full-time worker increase recently due shortage labor felt among firms. a wages, regular payment start rise addition increase overtime bonus payments. although pace increase wage moderate partly due firms' effort restrain labor costs, increase likely bi review 59/2006 1 continue. with increase temporary income also permanent part income, private consumption likely remain strong. turn prices, domestic corporate good price rising, due surge price international commodity crude oil nonferrous metals. recently release statistic show year-on-year rate increase domestic corporate good price 3.3 percent may, fast 2.5 percent increase april. it likely remain high time being. the year-on-year rate increase cpi 0.5 percent april continue uptrend. look individual price item cpi basket, number item show price rise gradually increasing, trend toward price increase become robust. for example, price services, package tours, golf fees, educational costs, revise upward start new fiscal year. service price important indicator confirm general trend prices, movement largely influence change wages. price item services, personal effect clothing, also increase gradually. ii. development overseas economy a i explained, japan's economy likely achieve sustainable growth price stability. domestic private demand seem stand firm foundation give structural adjustment pressure corporate sector financial system dissipated. this direct attention development overseas economy one major risk factor determine outlook japan's economy. in u.s. economy, business fix investment production increase steadily, sign deceleration house construction finally observe pace increase household spend employment slowing. this trend suggest interest rate raise federal reserve date gradually take effect. the increase core cpi accelerate slightly, reflect rise utilization labor production capacity addition high crude oil prices. in situation, inflationary concern seem mounting. a development near future, important issue whether economic deceleration unite state result soft landing, whether inflationary concern contained. in europe, momentum economic recovery increase gradually, evident increase export production recovery household spending. under circumstances, european central bank carefully raise policy interest rate since 2005 order stave upward pressure general price high crude oil price sustain economic expansion. the chinese economy continue show extremely high growth. monetary policy tighten recently deal expansion money stock bank lend well high growth business fix investment. whether overheat economic activity contain appropriate policy conduct important factor monitor development chinese economy also world economy, global price development include development international commodity prices. in 2005, world economy grow nearly 5 percent. this expansion support fact stable financial environment maintain contain upward pressure prices. a key factor maintain stable financial environment whether global inflationary concern continue contain future. iii. development financial market i would next like briefly touch recent development global financial markets. stock price decline emerge economy well major industrial countries. financial market many emerge economy weak, evident fall bond price foreign exchange rate addition stock prices. price international commodities, include nonferrous metals, decline recently, exhibit large increases. market participant point various factor behind developments. one adjustment stock commodity prices, rise substantially prolong accommodative financial environment around world, response change degree financial accommodation. 2 bi review 59/2006 another factor uncertainty whether inflationary risk contained, whether considerable deceleration economic activity stave even inflationary risk contained. the fundamental economy worldwide, include japan's, seem change significantly far. under current economic circumstances, financial market evolve pursuit new equilibrium digest new information interact other. financial market development continue warrant careful monitoring, since influence economic activity impact business household sentiment. iv. development inventory investment a i mention earlier, domestic private demand stand firm foundation, corporate sector, necessary pay attention possibility stock adjustment. such adjustment involve downside upside risk outlook economic activity short term: inventory adjustment, example it-related sectors, downside risk acceleration business fix investment upside risk. give output gap already closed, acceleration business fix investment regard upside risk short term also factor lead large economic swing long term result subsequent downturn. look first inventory investment, level inventory still relatively low. the inventory cycle manufacture sector whole suggest growth shipment inventory le balance. focus individual industries, excess inventories, particularly general-purpose products, build iron steel, chemical industries, recently, adjustment industry come end. in it-related sectors, level inventory somewhat high, basically line increase shipments, thus unintended excessive inventory build moment. there factors, however, may trigger inventory adjustments. for example, although demand it-related good expect continue increasing, possibility inventory adjustment good occur depend development demand. this supply good increase rapid pace, include high-value-added product sector japanese firm competitive edge. v. development business fix investment a mention earlier, acceleration business fix investment, another possible avenue stock adjustments, entail upside risk short term also factor lead large economic swing long term result subsequent downturn. from business-cycle point view, economic recovery appear reach mature stage growth project gradually decelerate potential growth rate. although corporate performance likely remain strong, growth business fix investment expect slow level capital stock become high accumulation past investment. a result, drive force economic activity shift gradually corporate sector household sector. the deceleration business fix investment expect stave build-up capital stock contribute achieve sustain period growth. especially give output gap closed, excessive investment strong economic growth likely increase risk eventual swingback. so far, sign excessive investment observed. in face intense global competition, firm seem selective allocate business resources. it true, however, financial environment extremely accommodative give incentive firm accelerate business fix investment. real short-term interest rate japan currently negative extremely low compare real gdp growth currently exceed 3 percent estimate growth rate potential output range 1.5 2.0 percent. moreover, function financial system enhance private financial institution maintain proactive lend posture. the year-on-year growth lend private bank turn positive summer 2005 gradual upward trend since. bi review 59/2006 3 vi. conduct monetary policy low-inflation environment turn slightly theoretical issue, recently, main difficulty conduct monetary policy low-inflation environment focus deal risk deflationary spiral. in low-inflation environment, nominal interest rate typically low thus probable constrain zero bound. because nominal interest rate cannot low zero, real interest rate likely become high optimal level economy price fall. that increase risk economy fall vicious cycle decline price deteriorate economic activity. in japan, risk matter strong concern since end 1990s. at present, risk become low, since japanese financial system restore stability firm resolve excess production capacity, employment, debt. on hand, economic activity pick result unprecedented monetary ease severe economic condition low inflation, central bank require carry monetary policy adroitly adjust monetary accommodation assess upside risks. for example, since inflation rate tend exhibit strong inertia, even supply-demand condition economy become tighter, observe rate inflation inflation expectation likely remain anchor low level. in situation, maintain excessively accommodative monetary condition entail risk cause temporary overheat economy subsequent downturn, thereby result large swing economic activity. the sensitivity rate inflation change output gap tend become weak japan also abroad recent years, reflect structural change deregulation, advance information telecommunication technology, deepen economic globalization. since price become le sensitive short term, central bank require take appropriate measure examine medium- long-term risk economy. this suggest need take forward-looking approach conduct monetary policy. vii. a stable economic price environment a stable economic price environment, achieve appropriate conduct monetary policy view medium- long-term risks, allow firm household make decision smoothly. a result, allocation resource economy whole efficient, short-term economic fluctuation reduce also medium- long-term growth path push up. look back real gdp trend japan unite state past 25 year so, see economy often achieve high growth move le volatile manner. a result smooth economic adjustment early 1980s second oil crisis, japan's economy follow high trend growth path u.s. economy move le volatile manner thereafter. this situation, however, reverse burst asset price bubble early 1990s, japan's economy experience decline trend growth path move volatile manner. japan's economy emerge prolong stagnation aftermath burst asset price bubble, head toward sustainable growth path price stability. in order ensure development, important, appropriate conduct monetary policy, minimize volatility business cycle maintain stable economic environment. viii. conduct monetary policy before conclude speech today, i talk bank's conduct monetary policy base assessment economic activity price mention far. the bank reduce outstanding balance current account bank pay due attention stability money market guideline money market operation encourage uncollateralized overnight call rate remain effectively zero percent. through process, uncollateralized overnight call rate stable around zero percent, despite small temporary increases. in call market, interest rate show fluctuation reflect market condition volume transaction gradually increasing. under circumstances, 4 bi review 59/2006 bank long find difficult control uncollateralized overnight call rate day-to-day operations. in sense, reduction outstanding balance current account virtually completed. with regard future course monetary policy, bank conduct monetary policy line think describe outlook report long development economic activity price follow bank's projection present also outlook report. in words, seem probable accommodative financial condition ensue low interest rate maintain time follow period uncollateralized overnight call rate effectively zero percent. through beyond stage, bank adjust level interest rate gradually light development economic activity prices. the time policy change depend development economic activity price time on, predetermine view regard future path monetary policy point. the projection outlook report, appear desirable course economy, is, sustainable growth price stability, base assumption market participant firm factor future policy change extent make decisions. if economy develop line projection, change policy interest rate light development economic activity price stave excess economic activity, minimize volatility business cycles, lead economy onto sustainable growth path. the projection suggest economic activity likely slow price expect follow moderate uptrend. consequently, bank drastically adjust policy interest rate, but, mention earlier, able adjust interest rate "gradually." of course, time lag monetary policy action influence economic activity prices, therefore necessary take current economic price situation account also look ahead future developments. in addition, assess development economic activity prices, important pay close attention variety indicator relevant information order carefully judge overall condition economic activity price rather concentrate one particular indicator, cpi period quantitative easing. conclusion in sum, japan's economy continue grow, domestic external demand also corporate household sector well balance. the bank determine contribute lead japan's economy sustainable growth price stability, appropriate conduct monetary policy. bi review 59/2006 5 nicholas c garganas: regional financial stability around eurozone presentation mr nicholas c garganas, governor bank greece, conference regional financial stability around eurozone, organise euro 50 group, istanbul, 1 june 2006. * * * i delight ask participate conference “regional financial stability around eurozone”. this topic gain importance economy - particularly financial system - south-eastern european (see) country increasingly develop linkage within region eurozone. in recent years, see country generally experience high rate economic growth, improvement macroeconomic fundamentals, significant transformation growth financial systems. for sustainable future growth development region, maintenance financial stability essential precondition. in turn, existence effective legal regulatory framework financial sector conduct financial supervision accordance international best practice play important role promote financial stability. to end, considerable effort already make strengthen legal regulatory framework financial sector see country improve supervisory practice. in follows, i briefly discus various channel external assistance towards regulatory supervisory reform south-eastern europe provided, identify area reform expertise appear necessary, suggest co-operative arrangement could contribute objective. over past fifteen year so, technical assistance improve legal regulatory framework financial sector see country implementation enforcement capability competent national authority provide various form international organisation imf, world bank, bis. although comprehensive discussion project realistic short presentation, may worthwhile least mention them. supervisory personnel see country participate train seminar offer financial stability institute bi joint vienna institute. under joint imf-world bank financial sector assessment program, international team expert assess financial sector see country degree compliance basel core principle identify weakness propose corrective measures, many since implement country concerned. in coordination international institutions, unite state agency international development (usaid) support project many see country improve regulatory framework financial sector conduct supervision. a see country aspire eventual eu membership, european commission particularly active region provide technical assistance monitor progress financial sector reform. a regard technical assistance, european commission’s main instrument twin program finance phare card facilities. twin program particularly useful since beneficiary country determine specific need subsequently able choose one best meet requirement among proposal submitted. twin program also help establish close work relationship authority recipient country eu country provide technical assistance. the ecb also provide technical assistance see country various channel short-term missions, conference internships. ecb assistance give field money bank statistics, payment settlement system financial stability well field fall outside scope presentation. moreover, ecb, act co-ordinator

country bilateral basis financial sector authority individual eu countries, usually le formal ad hoc arrangement focus specific area particular see country require expertise. finally, memoranda understand conclude bank supervisory authority eu country see country provide regular meet discus supervisory principle practice and, cases, include specific provision co-operation staff training. in see countries, basic legal regulatory framework financial sector place largely conform international standards. nevertheless, difference see country regard state development financial sector regulation supervision. generally, positive relationship progress area far country bi review 59/2006 1 move along path lead eu membership. a bulgaria romania accede country turkey, croatia fyrom eu-candidate countries, generally make great progress adopt acquis communautaire financial sector compare remain see countries, various stage stabilisation association process. a rule, see country legal regulatory framework implementation enforcement capability supervisory authority develop bank sector compare segment financial system. this due fact capital market still underdevelop see countries, bank sector dominate financial system countries. accordingly, national authority foreign provider technical assistance place emphasis regulatory supervisory reform bank sector. [bulgaria romania nevertheless make progress toward harmonization eu regulation capital markets.] meanwhile, see country except turkey, foreign banks, mainly eu countries, acquired, subsidiary branch networks, dominant position local bank systems. this development increase competition, facilitate transfer expertise especially credit assessment risk management enhance ability local bank system operate demand supervisory standards. in contrast bank sector, insurance sector see country still underdevelop tend characterize weak governance regulation, despite improvement recent years, mainly bulgaria romania connection countries’ preparation eu accession. furthermore, reflect persist problem governance regulation, insurance sector see country tend undercapitalized. in bank sector see counties, appear degree progress towards achieve international best standard area regulatory supervisory interest, particularly regard implementation enforcement capability competent authorities. in number countries, assessment behalf european commission imf reveal remain weakness field anti-money laundering, consolidate supervision financial conglomerates, implementation international financial report standard (ifrs), integrate assessment risk management system extent co-operation foreign supervisors. [as regard ifrs, worth note bulgaria, romania, croatia, serbia already implement standard company banks, turkey albania envisage implementation 2008.] moreover, see country face important medium-term challenge relate effective application principle good corporate governance across financial sector, implementation basel ii capital adequacy framework development comprehensive methodology financial stability assessment, include design macro stress-testing framework, especially credit risk. although central bank see country already make progress financial stability assessment, work need do assessment need increasingly take account potential repercussion regional wide european developments. the consideration indicate area assistance may require particular countries. apart program support international organisations, continue recourse bilateral co-operation arrangement authority eu country see country would particularly useful. in respect, experience authority eu country relatively recently complete reform financial sector accordance international standard would valuable input authority see country currently face similar challenges. also, peer group review financial sector supervisor country could play useful role periodically assess effectiveness financial sector regulation supervision see country offer advice need improvements. finally, national bank federation see country help bring operation local bank eu standard multilateral co-operation area staff train convergence implementation sound operate risk management systems. to end, national bank federation participate interbalkan bank forum recently sign memorandum understanding. it important recognize that, financial system see country liberalize economy become open, task maintain financial stability become challenging. in meet challenge, i believe arrangement supervisory co-operation provision technical assistance continue play useful role support national effort regulatory supervisory reform aim strengthen resilience financial sector see country achieve conformity eu standards. 2 bi review 59/2006 let conclude stress importance financial system economic growth. why financial system crucial? the answer financial system think coordinate mechanism allocate capital build factories, house roads. if capital misallocated, economy operate inefficiently economic growth low (mishkin, 2005)1. effectively, high level human capital increase productivity labour, efficient financial system increase productivity factor inputs. for reason, financial system think central nervous system economy. if stable efficient, coordinate economy’s activities, help improve live standard citizen thank attention. 1 mishkin, s. frederick (2005), “is financial globalization beneficial?” nber work paper no.

accelerated, though, pace consistent manageable level financial volatility consistent domestic monetary stability. the macroeconomic monetary environment therefore supportive possible also, importantly, environment must stable possible. liberalization must therefore balance stability. the latter important. many caribbean economy identify service key sector offer fast prospect internationalization. caribbean economy realize accelerate development service sector even manufacture sector matures. this certainly case international financial centre (usually term “offshore

small-scale operation expand rapidly draw potential linkage sector economy rest world. electronic commerce also provide opportunity caribbean companies, since recognize size constraint. it allow service provider region offer service foreign jurisdiction great ease, though admittedly, also permit foreign professional offer service region well. this mean local provider step game, since technology already outpace ability protect domestic service provider force internationalization service markets. in fact, service become trade item internet. this mode service delivery give develop country like caribbean advantage, give away since take competition away. because traditional perception develop country better, quality service provide caribbean need superior provide develop country

low costs. no long financial service provider consider competent maximize use modern technology techniques. client computerize systems, many use internet conduct commerce, others utilize electronic

financial service provider sound understand technologies, which, case must superior client. the financial service provider caribbean must keep firm forefront technological development irrespective

bi review 59/2006 jean-claude trichet: celebrate 50th anniversary paris club speech mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank, celebration 50th anniversary paris club, paris, 14 june 2006. * * * it great pleasure paris occasion 50th anniversary paris club. this paris club important forum make major contribution area orderly debt restructuring, also i course lot personal memory long time – 1982 1993 – i spend actively participate activities, together lot close friend world. the paris club, responsible reschedule official bilateral credit develop emerge market economies, play remarkable role forum crisis management resolution. embed international financial system, paris club respond change international financial landscape various financial crisis last decade systematically adapt modus operandi vary need different group indebted countries. in particular, recognise traditional mechanism sufficient attain sustainable external debt levels, paris club introduce increasingly concessional debt restructure term and, late 1980s, debt reduction mechanism well address rise debt burden certain countries. during time, paris club reach peak level activity. more recently, number country reschedule paris club creditor declining, reflect enhance access middle-income country market finance comprehensive debt stock treatment low income countries. since first debt reschedule meet 1956, paris club highly effective reach 400 agreement 81 debtor countries, cover total usd 523 billion nominal value. the success paris club understandable and, consider accomplishment attain could term “non-institution” (there international treaty write charter set paris club), may therefore appear paradox first sight. the operation paris club last five decade reflect way develop emerge market economy benefit economic financial globalisation challenge face process. let specific substantial benefit economic financial globalisation inevitable challenge pose policy-makers market participants. among benefit globalisation, i would mention one appear particularly relevant activity paris club. emerge country become integrate world economy. they increasingly involve exchange good capital, benefit transfer know-how technologies. the scrutiny international investor enhance quality economic policy, thus contribute good fundamentals. in recent years, several emerge country provide rest world net resource form current account surplus – trend would unthinkable year ago midst asian crisis. give developments, increase number emerge country significantly decrease external debt even turn net creditor vis-à-vis rest world. that said, economic success come without risks. globalisation capital mobility make international system vulnerable change investor sentiment. we remember severe financial crisis occur last 25 years, include debt crisis 1980s, start poland mexico spread latin america, africa, middle east soviet union; mexican crisis 1994; asian crisis start 1997; russian crisis 1998; argentinian crisis 2001-02. all events, irrespective origin magnitude, pose major threat international financial system. while international community always manage resolve crises, highlight potential vulnerability global economy, resilience cannot take granted. this true even period characterise high growth, low inflation stability financial market one experience since 2003. past financial crisis or, benign way, recent increase risk awareness reflect high asset price volatility, remind u relentless need improve function mechanism deal prevention resolution events. bi review 57/2006 1 i focus two issue today. first, i would like take opportunity review important contribution paris club orderly sovereign debt restructure last 50 years. second, i make observation recent international development relate crisis prevention resolution. history achievement paris club the fact paris club enjoy trust international financial community half century due efficient way deal sovereign debt restructure combine pragmatism strict set principle implement work agreement debt restructuring. first, make decision case-by-case basis allow paris club creditor tailor action individual situation debtor country. such approach reflect spirit permanent adaptation new financial problem difficulty face reschedule countries. second, paris club treatment agree consensus participate creditor countries. third, creditor country apply principle conditionality, whereby debt treatment grant country need debt relief implement appropriate reform resolve payment difficulty context imf programme. fourth, principle solidarity commit every paris club creditor, conclusion individual bilateral agreements, respect term agree upon joint negotiation. last least, paris club attache great value comparability treatment creditors. by insist debtor country accept le favourable term another creditor agree consensus within paris club, ensure taxpayers’ claim subordinate creditor financial interest preserved. moreover, apply clause provide guarantee agree debt treatment reach intend goal put debtor countries’ debt burden sustainable footing. keep principle mind, main concrete achievement paris club? the first paris club restructure take place, mentioned, 1956, argentina official creditor agree reschedule payment due officially support credits. at time, club formal rule procedure intend provide pragmatic response specific problems. until 1980, paris club creditor average sign four agreement per year, apply standard “classic terms”, whereby credit reschedule appropriate market rate. during early year paris club, negotiation agreement standardised, prepare forum busy time come. i remember well year intense negotiation overall activity club. i remember well member club time i see room. to i would like express friendship gratitude. we intense discussion always possible find solution member club extraordinary level professionalism mutual confidence. i remember well official member government debtor countries, official mexico, brazil, argentina, poland, egypt, nigeria, morocco, soviet union russia, many more. among official let mention angel gurría, present secretary general oecd, first negotiator i encountered, defend interest mexico remarkable professionalism lucidity. i remember well major partner club period 1982-1993 public private sectors. i would like mention name jacques de larosière michel camdessus imf, paul volcker, alan greenspan bill mcdonnough federal reserve, bill rhodes regard private sector rescheduling. without remarkable people, without lucidity tireless activity world would able surmount difficulty enormous global magnitude. the paris club felt fall-out crisis workload increase exponentially: number agreement conclude rise well ten per annum reach all-time high 24 1989. many country negotiate multiple debt agreement paris club. they come globe, bulk sub-saharan africa latin america, also asia (the philippines), middle east (egypt jordan) central eastern europe (poland, yugoslavia bulgaria). 2 bi review 57/2006 while paris club confine mandate solely debt reschedule 1988, change radically modus operandi late 1980s, give severe impact debt crisis poor highly indebted countries. the paris club adopt completely new approach treatment debt country whose debt burden remain unsustainable. it agree reduce net present value eligible debt, thus move increasingly concessional reschedule terms, fact include reduction third since 1988 toronto terms, half since 1991 london terms, two-thirds since 1995 naples terms. on latter occasion, paris club agree first time also consider implement stock treatment – flow relief, do time – facilitate exit repeat reschedulings. finally, middle-income country benefit introduction favourable houston term 1990. when become clear even concessional debt reschedule reduction mechanism still sufficient attain sustainable external debt levels, particularly number african low-income countries, another key policy initiative launch 1996 imf world bank: heavily indebted poor country initiative (hipc). under initiative, entire international community, include multilateral institutions, decide take coordinate action reduce debt burden eligible country sustainable levels. in context, paris club creditor agree increase reduction net present value eligible debt 80% lyon term and, 2000, 90% even cologne terms. the financial implication decision substantial: around 36% initiative’s total cost, amount usd 38 billion thus far, bear paris club creditors. finally, hipc initiative supplement 2005 multilateral debt relief initiative, allow 100% debt relief multilateral institution country complete hipc process. this mark major break principle prefer creditor status international financial institutions. look recent past paris club, another development worth note number country reschedule paris club creditor decline significantly. besides general macroeconomic development i recall begin talk, desirable trend also due two specific developments: first, comprehensive debt stock treatment low income countries; second, graduation reschedule middle-income country result implementation economic reform increase access market finance thus private creditors. indeed, official flow emerge market dominant 1980s, reach average 60% total flows, 1990s saw dramatic increase private flows, average account around 85% period 1990 2003. accordingly, paris club pay increase attention coordination private sector creditors. in particular, early discussion schedule proportion private external debt deem significant comparability treatment issue. also, interaction paris club creditor private sector representative initiate private creditor indicate willingness help restore debt sustainability good faith comprehensive debt treatment envisaged. a result enhance access middle-income country market financing, paris club already conclude increase number prepayment agreement debtor countries. recent agreement include poland, russian federation, peru brazil. in passing, let mention imf make similar experience face considerable decline demand resource recent years. let conclude part talk respond claim paris club lack transparency predictability. i would argue that, quite contrary, rule apply paris club clear, transparent well-tailored address different country groupings. in particular, club’s classic term standard treatment, houston terms, naples term cologne term apply respectively highly-indebted lower-middle-income countries, highly-indebted poor countries, country eligible hipc initiative. moreover, embed international financial system, paris club work closely creditor debtor countries, also imf market participants. crisis prevention resolution in reflections, i present paris club important forum negotiations, creditor country individual debtor country among creditor themselves. i wish take wide perspective share think international community stand area crisis prevention resolution. bi review 57/2006 3 start crisis prevention, i would like underline grow number initiative undertake policy-makers market participant improve transparency promote best practices. one weakness identify financial crisis 1990s considerable information asymmetry local authorities, market participants, international financial institutions. transparency key precondition well-functioning market since facilitate good risk management lead strengthen market discipline. it therefore welcome significant change introduce number fields. for example, imf start disclose information policy encourage increase transparency membership. a large number international standard code good practice agree upon, cover different field transparency fiscal policy monetary financial policies, bank supervision, corporate governance, account auditing. the paris club turn also take step increase transparency procedures, instance convene meet private sector representative provide comprehensive information website. turn crisis management resolution, i would argue important lesson learn past experiences. discussion continue appropriate involvement private sector solve debt crises. this important availability official fund limited, also moral hazard concern associate large financial assistance provide official sector. since every single crisis different, challenge arise strike right balance debtor country’s domestic adjustment, private sector involvement official support. a regard role official sector area crisis management, work continue imf number issue context strategic review activities. first, open issue lack clear guideline involvement imf process sovereign debt restructure event country face unsustainable debt situation. the case argentina example difficult debt restructure process. it crucial authority cooperate closely creditors, imf remain closely involve process take active role provide information. in context, discussion need fund financially support country process renegotiate debt private creditors, i.e. lending-into-arrears policy. second, discussion continue framework large financial assistance programme – so-called exceptional access policy – set guideline order make fund lend predictable. finally, proposal examine possible new instrument provide high access contingent financing. all all, important different discussion view increase predictability clarity part official sector set right incentive actor involved. while several issue still need address context crisis resolution, substantial progress achieve two fronts, aim improve debtor-creditor relation define ex ante best condition address possible financial crisis lead debt restructuring. by so, two initiative eventually also beneficial term crisis prevention. first, follow pioneer issuance mexico bond collective action clause (cacs) february 2003, adoption cacs international sovereign bond become much widespread. practically international sovereign bond issue since mid-2005 contain cacs, which, yet tested, become market standard. a confirm market participants, inclusion cacs affect price international sovereign bonds, initially feared. the share outstanding bond include cacs increased, result, 60% end february 2006. this mean gradually move towards time entire stock outstanding debt include cacs. i deem development remarkable, particular view rather sceptical attitude many country private sector representative take past vis-à-vis recommendation rey report publish 1994 mexican crisis. second, i please note principle stable capital flow fair debt restructure emerge markets, endorse g20 november 2004, gain international support. the aim market-based voluntary principle provide guideline behaviour sovereign issuer private creditor regard information sharing, dialogue, close cooperation time financial distress. from outset, i personally involve launch principle since i promote idea guideline carry potential help prevent liquidity problem turn deep financial crisis serious repercussion party involved. the principle also likely improve handle possible future private sector debt restructurings. 4 bi review 57/2006 conclusion in view, see long-term horizon, concept paris club seem many respect precursor signal main feature late prove appropriate handle stimulate complex globalise economy finance world today. first paris club global start. it remarkable early 1956 case argentina appear necessary embark single concept public credit restructure series bilateral agreements. in way, soon creditor emerge world express desire participate activity group creditor accepted. brazil creditor poland, example. second, paris club open transparent. it bold initiative end 70 begin 80 invite international institutions, particular imf, world bank regional development banks, together unite nation undp oecd participate discussion and/or observe reschedule negotiations. this unseen level transparency would compare discrete bilateral negotiation norm setting-up club. third, paris club base set principle apply party concern purely voluntary fashion. there setting-up new institution, new official piece legislation regulation. globalisation global ownership, transaparency voluntary implementation principle are, view, three major avenue prove necessary also successful world today. i would particularly stress systemic importance code good conduct good practices, reflect “principles”, agree upon large degree global consensus, voluntary incorporate enhance transparency. this key good understand today's global trend international economics finance. i feel proud, along room i sure, paris club may among first invent try promising. i thank attention. bi review 57/2006 5 seong-tae lee: monetary policy environment low inflation open address mr seong-tae lee, governor chairman the bank korea, the bank korea international conference 2006, seoul, 16 june 2006. * * * greet lady gentlemen, i delight express warm welcome attend "the bank korea international conference 2006". i would like extend particular gratitude keynote speaker, professor frederic mishkin columbia university; luncheon speaker, president un-chan jung seoul national university; president william poole federal reserve bank st. louis; chairpersons, speaker discussants, take time busy schedule u today. this year's conference, mark 56th anniversary bank korea's establishment, deal theme "monetary policy environment low inflation". many central bank include bank korea currently face difficulty conduct monetary policy new environment characterize low inflation. in regard, i believe today's conference meaningful timely. conduct monetary policy low inflation a aware, inflation throughout world decline since mid-1990s. this mainly attributable emergence global stage vast low-wage economy china india; productivity gain make possible information technology (it) development; intensify competition domestic global markets. in addition factors, increase credibility central bank also believe contribute low inflation. over years, central bank around world resolute pursuit price stability, work hard enhance capability conduct monetary policy. together continue price stability, help low inflation expectation economic agents. the case much korea. both consumer price core inflation rate run level two percentage point low saw prior currency crisis. particularly, rate core inflation nowadays move substantially low bind bank korea's target range. in last months, upward price movement observe several countries. however, rise price scale similar past long expect reappear time being, firm continue effort improve productivity accelerate integration world economy. although concern run-up oil price may serve factor cause price instability, oil much le effect inflation past. this mainly due decline oil-dependency line improve energy efficiency, stabilization inflation expectations, on. this emergence global low inflation course welcome phenomenon central banks, price stability top priority. at time, however, impose upon new set tasks. above all, monetary policy conduct solely eye focus price stability, factor represent threat stability whole economy could overlooked. from early 2001, thank environment continue price stability, central bank around world able combat economic slowdown substantial reduction policy rates. the continuance low interest rate stance significant length time, however, lead over-abundant supply liquidity accompany side effect include sharp rise asset prices. a saw case japanese asset bubble late 1980s, low inflation always guarantee financial macroeconomic stability. bi review 57/2006 1 how best deal economic imbalance common problem many central bank nowadays face. particularly country select inflation target regimes, challenge even serious. in case korea, protract period low interest rates, real estate price rise sharply large increase household sector borrow financial institutions. this impose burden bank korea conduct monetary policy. another challenge confront central bank current era low inflation possibility policy response ability become blunted. if nominal interest rate low, line stabilization inflation expectations, little room central bank act business recession. in particular, nominal interest rate fall close zero bind due deflation factors, likelihood loss monetary policy effectiveness. besides this, response real economy interest

rybiński, deputy president national bank poland, series seminar centre european regional local study unesco chair, warsaw university, warsaw, 6 april 2006. * * * lady gentlemen, globalisation term use frequently economic debate nowadays, would difficult find area economic research “globalisation-free”. however, mean broad, globalisation refer discussion, various people understand various things. for reason, discussion globalisation monetary policy commence attempt define term. one definition globalisation provide international monetary fund (imf)1, construe “the grow interdependence (integration) national economies, particular result grow international trade financial flows”. moreover, element globalisation worth mention fast flow information knowledge, drive force behind globalisation processes. one keep mind globalisation completely new phenomenon2. in view existence political barrier international trade, flow capital good equally possible one hundred year ago today. it go without saying, however, result rapid development technology, especially ict area, drastically low cost say exchange, international integration trade, investment, financial service advance ever before. the economic policy committee european union3 point four factor lead rapid development globalisation past years: • multilateral trade liberalisation; average custom duty low ca. 30% • successful economic reform many develop countries, especially china india • technological advancement, especially ict sector transportation, significantly low cost trade. to give example, fee sea, land air transportation, telephone call satellite call go 21%, 30%, 95% 88%, respectively. • technological advancement blur borderline cannot become subject international trade. globalisation may create new macroeconomic interdependence replace traditional one know book economics. the majority economists, politician investor may still quite keep pace “seismic changes” take place economy4. however, really witness “seismic changes” economy, may worthwhile close look think meaning. globalisation impact economy may view different perspectives. today i would like u look globalisation perspective central bank, take consideration objective central bank, ability contribute shape economy instrument central bank disposal. to start with, let u consider channel globalisation may impact monetary policy central bank. 1 “economic globalization historical process, result human innovation technological progress. it refer increase integration economy around world, particularly trade financial flows. the term sometimes also refer movement people (labor) knowledge (technology) across international borders.” accord to: “globalization: threat opportunity?” imf staff, april 12, 2000

committee “responding challenge globalisation”, november 2005. 4 roach s. “the new macro globalization”, morgan stanley global economic forum, 6 june 2005. bi review 57/2006 1 firstly, globalisation - shape real economic process abroad, influence global business cycle commodity price global market - influence external environment national economy, monitor central bank central bank operates. today, central bank small open market economy, would wish turn blind eye development external environment focus solely development national economy, doom failure. secondly, globalisation change wage price set mechanism national economy, impact domestic inflation. globalisation (the grow openness economies) - grow share country low manufacture cost global output - increase margin wage pressures, consequence low inflation. at time, globalisation drive commodity prices, thus contribute - least temporarily - increase inflation. thirdly, increase international migration workforce change situation local labour markets. where workforce outflows, wage pressure increase; case inflow workforce, wage pressure go down. fourthly, globalisation change function financial market increase uncertainty impact decision make central bank market macroeconomic variables. fifthly, globalisation impact central bank’s perception economic environment monetary policy strategy applies. a fast transfer economic know-how (flow economic knowledge analytical methods) change method economic analysis central bank economists, well way decision regard monetary policy made. sixthly, globalisation increase risk speculative bubble asset market. let u step-by-step look channel influence globalisation monetary policy. re 1) the grow share international trade global output well increase international capital flow cause situation, growth rate national economy depend increasingly development global economy. to illustrate impact globalisation economic prospects, attention draw hot topic macroeconomic policy, namely problem global imbalances. to give facts, u current account deficit grow gradually past year exceed usd 800 billion, i.e. 6.5% u.s. gdp, last year. this deficit, represent import save rest world usa, finance asian central banks, example people bank china, oil-exporting countries. the available forecast show deficit continue grow. an animate debate currently underway determine whether steady situation simply reflect new principle global economy5, whether trend bind stop reverse sooner later, may entail significant increase u long-term interest rates, strong depreciation u dollar serious slowdown global economic growth. the majority empirical theoretical study indicate grow probability latter scenario, especially due step take many countries. these step include necessity accelerate potential gdp growth european union japan reform labour market product market, increase save u curb budget deficit, reform financial sector china subsequent gradual float renminbi exchange rate. the central bank must consider possible scenario development global economy possible adjustment global imbalances, significantly impact perspective national economy, monetary policy pursued. moreover, central bank, institution manage foreign exchange reserves, must monitor change global financial market, change investment decision make central bank influence return foreign exchange reserves. 5 this thesis advanced, among others, frequently quote work: m.dooley, d.folkerts-landau, p.garber “an essay revive bretton wood system“, nber work paper 9971, september 2003. 2 bi review 57/2006 re 2) globalisation change wage price set mechanism domestic economy. this ensue increase international competition grow role outsource offshoring. offshoring consist transfer manufacturing, service order abroad, transfer may make within single company another company. outsource consist renounce manufacture service give company obtain good service another company may locate another country. in past, major part chain manufacture service use locate give country, mean that, monetary policy perspective, domestic demand great importance, particular - size output relation potential level i.e. so-called output gap. the impact global economy, hand, observe mainly due change terms-of-trade i.e. ratio export import prices, turn affect by, among others, commodity price change external demand. nowadays, inter alia result globalisation production services, role domestic output gap explain inflation decrease significantly, show bi research6. a case model apply nbp forecast inflation, role output gap factor determine inflation much small use be. in old book macroeconomics inflation treat largely local development, i.e. dependent great measure domestic factor (such domestic output gap inflation expectations). today, inflation become increasingly le local, turn, become dependent global factors, i.e. relationship global demand global supply. research analyse course inflation 22 oecd country 1960 2003 show 70% inflation volatility may explain common factor7. this global, common factor explain change inflation trend (the increase inflation 1960 1980 subsequent decrease), also inflation fluctuation business cycle. the research also show that, domestic inflation deviate “global” inflation, exhibit “global-inflation-reverting” tendency. a consequence, model forecast domestic inflation may improve significantly take account “global inflation”. the fast-progressing globalisation closely relate offshoring outsourcing, whose scope also growing. unfortunately much hard data would allow assessment scale phenomenon. offshoring analysis available select country cover select industries. however, grow scale phenomenon reflect data global

living, trade union demand wage increases, trigger so-called second-round effect central bank increase interest rate mitigate inflation. nowadays, trade union must take account fact case wage increases, production service may transfer country low manufacture costs. in eu member states, 2002 november 2005, 202 case restructure company relate offshoring publicly announced, result transfer nearly one hundred thousand jobs. over period, offshoring stand behind nearly six per cent case publicly announce restructure company eu. so far, scale phenomenon large. however, offshoring strategy

forecast mckinsey global institute, off-shoring service country low manufacture cost year 2003 – 2008 go grow rate 30% annually. in 2003, global trade service ca. usd 1.7 trillion, mere 3% result offshoring low cost countries. it expect 2008 global trade service amount ca. usd 2.4 trillion, 10% represent offshoring business ict process low cost countries. to compare, travel industry represent 30% trade service oecd data, whereby transportation - 20%. base upon analysis eight representative sectors, mckinsey global institute estimate 2003, 18.3 million job service could transfer location (this apply mainly sector it - 2.8 million, bank - 3.3 million, insurance - 2.3 million, healthcare - 4.6 million retail sale - 4.3 million). extrapolate result global economy, may estimate 2008 ca.

policy perspective, important properly understand impact offshoring function local labour markets, - result ever great open economy - merge one global labour market. before fall socialism european countries, global market amount ca. one billion people. nowadays, i.e. china india join global economy, market comprise ca. four billion people. this bring situation job transfer new, attractive location people increasingly move search better-paid jobs. the large migration know “the great migration” take place china10. accord estimates, next 10 year ca. 200 million chinese migrate village city find employment industry - large extent export-oriented industry sector - services. this mean next 10 years, every month one two million chinese average give low-paid, low-productivity job agriculture take better-paid productive work sectors. the monetary policy must take account impact process go chinese economy economy countries. a oppose trade capital, flow people within eu member state stable. the annual net migration eu-15 remain level le 5 people per 1000 inhabitant past 40 years. approximately 9% eu population bear countries, whilst usa figure 12% ca. 20% canada australia. however, follow eu enlargement, 10 new member join structures, part world also see increase migration, show table 3 below. in cases, significant part domestic work force take employment countries. the estimate show that, example, ca. 5% lithuanian take employment country open labour market new eu member state follow 1 may 2004. a conclusion may draw open low cost economies, especially chinese economy, increase international competition market good service relate thereto, change method set price enterprise determine wage labour market. enterprise increasingly become price-takers, thus even situation rise cost manufacturing, unable lift price shift grow cost onto customer. similar true wages, whose level determine increasingly global labour market. research manufacture sector eu member

analyst also point dynamically grow chinese economy, us commodities, contribute significant increase prices, may potentially drive inflation. however, consider increase competitive pressure, possibility shift high cost commodity (e.g. oil) onto final price limited12. in addition, view fierce competition labour market change refer above, risk grow wage demand limited, so-called second-round effects. re 3) over past three decades, financial sector become highly international. financial services, provide strictly regulated, separate, domestic financial system past, provide ever open, competitive global system. one measure globalisation financial service sector grow volume cross-border capital flows. cross-border transaction bond share segment exceed 90 trillion (thousand billion) u dollar per annum, translate usd 250 billion daily13. moreover, size financial market mean global economy become ever greater. accord mckinsey global institute14, total value global financial asset usd 118 trillion, whilst far back 1980 12 trillion. the increase volume financial asset progress high rate output, reach threefold global gdp, whilst back 1980 approximately equal world output. additionally, fast grow segment financial market segment private debt securities. what more, international issue security grow high rate domestic issues, mean company increasingly finance activity fund raise abroad. additionally, important feature development financial market gradual fall significance intermediation bank sector simultaneous increase significance market intermediation15. a consequence, central bank’s channel influence economy changing. in past bank loan channel deem important; loose significance relative terms. until recently, investment rate economy large extent dependent domestic save rate, way contradictory one fundamental assumption economic model full integration capital markets. the economy feature so-called home bias i.e. great inclination domestic investor invest domestic asset rather foreign assets16. the late research17 suggest home bias past year could drop significantly, least oecd countries. the decrease may attribute growth cross-border capital flows. what mean monetary policy? if domestic foreign financial asset treat perfect substitutes, domestic interest rates, especially mid- long-term ones, determine global market, thus influence particular central bank level weakened. this phenomenon already observe usa. 12 melick w., galati g. “the evolve inflation process: overview”, bi work paper no 196, 2006. 13 hannoun h.

perspective, remain roughly unchanged18. a result, effect tighten monetary policy aggregate demand significantly contain due lack response long-term interest rates. in world global financial market nobody seem surprise fact session federal open market committee (fomc19) american federal reserve, eye entire financial market fix chairman. why that? decision make fomc washington equally important investor new york london, tokyo, rio de janeiro, shanghai even warsaw. not fomc decision influence u economy, also - via financial market channel - entire global economy. an unexpected increase interest rate usa may bring sudden outflow capital emerge markets, thus weaken currency country increase bond yields. some economists20 make point important aspect grow internationalisation financial market increase discipline, extort investor government central bank individual countries. accord hypothesis, financial markets, continuous valuation securities, duly reward good punish bad economic policies. however, empirical result provide hard evidence support thesis fiscal policy discipline. it may stated, hand, financial globalisation may contribute discipline central bank “forcing” conduct monetary policy focus low stable inflation21. at time, significant risk relate financial market integration possibility shift economic problem one country upon countries, great (the contagion effect). between 1997 1998, country south-east asia experience effect, sudden capital fly out, bring financial crisis economy economy, could prevent either monetary exchange rate policy. re 4) one vital dimension globalisation fast spread knowledge, technology know-how. the flow know-how also apply public sector, include central bank. one feature modern central bank gradual homogenisation strategy apply monetary policy. since 1990, first time central bank new zealand start implement strategy direct inflation target (dit), 20 central bank follow adopt strategy. a result, dit strategy (applied since 1998 nbp) dominate strategy monetary policy, apply majority central bank develop countries22, more, central bank develop country (such turkey, philippines, ghana, romania armenia). a bloom dit strategy endorse observation central bank adopt “technology” low stable inflation one another. the dissemination dit strategy accompany decrease average inflation level, especially develop country low inflation high level. this may prove dissemination dit strategy one factor contribute disinflation. admittedly, impact dit strategy low inflation subject matter discussion23; however, empirical evidence exist implementation dit strategy improve macroeconomic 18 this even call greenspan’s conundrum, name former chairman u federal reserve. 19 fomc (federal open market committee):

zealous dit enthusiast, implementation usa soon question. 23 see e.g. “does inflation target matter?” ball l., sheridan n. in: ”the inflation-targeting debate” bernanke b.s., woodford m. (2005). bi review 57/2006 7 outcome (lower cost stabilise inflation, decrease influence price shock output shock inflation, thereby - decrease effect past inflation current inflation, reduce inflation persistence)24. empirical research also suggest dit strategy facilitate stabilisation long-term inflation expectations25. an additional result dissemination dit strategy elaboration standard communication conduct monetary policy (announcements decision-making authorities, inflation report publish inflation projections), facilitate contact central bank external environment (the financial market general public). it may speculate standard make interpretation decision make central bank easy foreign investors, should, huge cross-border capital flows, increase effectiveness monetary policy stabilise inflation. re 6) a mention before, process globalisation serious challenge central banks. follow increase human workforce relatively capital resource, pay workforce go down, cost manufacture many good services. set fuel price apart, whose increase also bring globalisation, inflation many country remain low, whereas strong increase global labour supply mitigate possibility occurrence second-round effect i.e. wage increase response rise current inflation. on hand, global surplus save investment cause capital chase high yield opportunities, thus increase asset price many countries. an exemplary case may increase stock exchange indices, bond price real property price anglo-saxon country e.g. spain. a logical consequence, question arise monetary policy conduct circumstances, particular, whether respond increase asset price despite fact inflation consumer good service remain low low. another vital question arise appropriate level central bank interest rate long-term interest rate remain low, possibly result globalisation. a hot debate accompany issue, among central bankers26 among academics.27 the chairman federal reserve, ben bernanke, address28 last month, present possible diagnosis regard source low interest rate bond market despite many fourteen increase central bank reference rates. there least two explanation situation. if long-term interest rate remain unchanged short-term one increase, mean either market pessimistically ass perspective economic growth risk premium relate forward rate decreases; may inflation risk premium real interest rate volatility risk premium. another explanation may effect global imbalances, i.e. result large purchase sovereign bond asian central bank oil- export countries. depend hypothesis true, implication monetary policy different. if long-term rate go result poor growth prospects, current short-term interest rate low respectively prevent possible deflation. if, however, specific factor relate globalisation decrease risk premium cause persist low long-term interest rates, short-term interest rate high order achieve appropriate restrictiveness monetary policy 24 see corbo v., landerretche

days, apply two iron rules: firstly, frequently determine position, secondly, use many waypoints possible. this mean that, especially new phenomenon emerge structural transformations, monetary policy must describe use simple indicators, e.g. inflation output gap taylor rule. monetary policy decision rather product complex analysis number indicator data cross-check qualitative information. in turn, another federal reserve governor, donald kohn29, devote recent address analysis condition central bank respond rapid change asset prices. in kohn’s opinion, two possible approaches. accord one them, describe conventional monetary policy, central bank focus stabilise inflation, treat change asset price exogenous process attempt influence asset price whatsoever. the option, describe kohn “extra action policy”, allow deviation current inflation level determine stable return improvement perspective achieve price stability future. however, extra action policy mean pierce speculative bubble central banks, mean rather “taking out” additional insurance possible negative shocks, may happen future. in kohn’s opinion, extra action policy may run rarely three condition met: • central bank must able identify asset bubble timely manner high certainty correctness analysis conclusions; • must high probability slight tighten monetary policy able stand speculative activity give asset market; • expect improvement future economic situation result small speculative bubble must significant high cost incur economy aftermath run extra action policy. to recapitulate train thought, kohn sceptical whether three above-mentioned condition sufficiently met; however, preclude future, understand economic process improve much enable run extra action policy reasonable. numerous statement follow presentation indicate proper supervision much good response asset bubble many people stress financial market supervision independent politicians, may necessary take action aim restrict speed speculative bubble build-up , suit certain politician due election cycle. the majority lecture deliver series seminar centre european regional local study unesco chair warsaw university apply issue

invitation. it almost go without say past several years, residential house market attract considerable attention, strong contributor overall growth u.s. economy. today i would like offer think current state residential commercial mortgage market discus way u.s. bank supervisor try ensure bank lend market safe sound. condition real estate market residential real estate market activity u.s. house market slowing. incoming data point decided, far moderate, cooling. start single-family house fell appreciably march april. because construction spur precede month unusually mild weather, slow spring natural. however, level house start lately fall elevate winter pace also pace last fall. indeed, construction permit issuance single-family homes, le affect weather, decline since september. sale new exist home drop noticeably high last year. in addition, inventory unsold home increased, mba index loan application home purchase trend low recent months. although slowdown house activity apparent wide range indicators, seem occur gradual way. notwithstanding recent slip, home construction home sale still relatively high levels. the underlie fundamental house demand also remain favorable. real disposable income grow solid pace. in aggregate, household balance sheet appear good position, even though risk clearly exist households. long-term mortgage rates, although substantially last summer's level, remain low relative historical experience. the late data house price office federal house enterprise oversight suggest house-price appreciation moderate price aggregate continue move up. between first quarter 2005 first quarter year, price index exist home sell repeat transaction increase 10 percent - solid gain bite record pace period mid-2004 mid-2005. focus first quarter 2006

consumption may change time. for example, linkage may strong past financial innovation make easy le costly household tap accumulate house equity. third, pronounce deceleration house price could outsized effect consumer confidence, decline confidence could additional damp force consumption. another housing-related issue bear watch mortgage debt accumulation. since end 2002, home mortgage debt outstanding rise 50 percent. the increase substantially push homeowners' mortgage payment relation income, spite historically low mortgage rates, grow use interest-only mortgages, lengthen average loan maturity past years. that said, homeowner appear able manage high payments: see little deterioration mortgage credit quality yet, overall delinquency rate remain low. go forward, i expect aggregate homeowner mortgage payment continue rise, especially adjustable-rate mortgage reach initial reset dates. however, reset adjustment expect gradual, modest number outstanding mortgage expect reset 2006 2007. to date, consumer appear manage change mortgage payment quite well. one area potential concern relate portion home sale account investors, oppose owner-occupants. historically, around 5 percent u.s. home purchase year investors; 2005, appear figure considerably higher. in many cases, investor purchase home believe price go rise further, necessarily want retain property time rental income. a price level even decline, important see whether investor activity subside significantly, so, impact mortgage market broadly. commercial real estate market in addition monitor residential markets, federal reserve keep close watch development commercial real estate markets. overall, condition sector appear improving. demand commercial space grow moderately, construction new space generally remain tame, restrain part steep land price high construction costs. the result widespread decline vacancy rate past years. reflect improve balance demand supply, rent commercial property

residential commercial mortgage lending. the agency receive many comment propose guidance, include comment association, consider discus step take next. i address guidance residential mortgage lend first. 2 bi review 57/2006 nontraditional mortgage product over past years, agency observe increase number residential mortgage loan allow borrower defer repayment principal and, sometimes, interest. these loans, often refer nontraditional mortgage loans, include interest-only (io) mortgage loans, borrower pay loan principal first year loan, payment-option adjustable-rate mortgage (option arms), borrower flexible payment option - could result negative amortization. io option arm estimate account almost one-third u.s. mortgage origination 2005, compare few 10 percent 2003. despite recent growth, however, estimate product still account le 20 percent aggregate domestic mortgage outstanding nearly $9 trillion. although credit quality residential mortgage generally remain strong, federal reserve bank supervisor concern banks' current risk-management technique may fully address level risk inherent nontraditional mortgages, risk would heighten downturn house market. mortgage characteristic nontraditional mortgage product available many years; however, historically offer higher-income borrowers. more recently, nontraditional mortgage offer wide spectrum consumers, include subprime borrowers, may le suit type mortgage may fully recognize embed risks. these borrower likely experience unmanageable payment shock life loan, mean may likely default loan. further, nontraditional mortgage loan become prevalent subprime market time risk tolerance capital market increased. bank need prepare result impact liquidity price risk spread return "normal" level competition mortgage bank industry intensifies. supervisor also observe lender increasingly combine nontraditional mortgage loan weak mitigate control credit exposure - example, accept le documentation evaluate applicant's creditworthiness evaluate borrower's ability meet increase monthly payment amortization begin interest rate rise. these "risk layering" practice become prevalent mortgage originations. thus, although bank may use element nontraditional mortgage product successfully past, recent ease traditional underwrite control sale nontraditional product subprime borrower may contribute loss products. supervisor concern bank may fully aware potential risk use risk-layering practice nontraditional mortgage products. these practice may become widespread past couple year competition borrower decline profit margin may force lender loosen credit standard maintain loan volume. in federal reserve board's recent senior loan officer survey, conduct past april, 10 percent survey institution report ease underwrite standard residential mortgage loans. only one survey lender report tighten standards. additionally, information source seem show continue growth number borrower purchase real estate equity use simultaneous second liens. naturally, watch sign default may rise. some industry evidence indicate delinquency may uptick; delinquency rate loan issue 2005 are, cases, high comparable loan issue early years. some industry observer believe increase delinquency loan issue 2005 directly relate continue ease underwrite standard increase use risk-layering practices. the industry trend i described, take together, justification issuance draft guidance nontraditional mortgage product federal reserve bank agencies. the propose guidance emphasize institution's risk-management process allow adequately identify, measure, monitor, control risk associate products. it remind lender importance assess borrower's ability repay loan, amortization begin interest rate rise. nontraditional mortgage product warrant bank strong risk-management standard well appropriate capital loan-loss reserves. further, banker consider impact prepayment penalty arms. lender provide enough information borrower clearly understand, choose product payment option, term risk associate loans, particularly extent bi review 57/2006 3 monthly payment may rise negative amortization may increase amount owe amount originally borrowed. lender recognize certain nontraditional mortgage loan untested stress environment; instance, nontraditional mortgage loan investor rely collateral value could particularly affect housing-price decline. a noted, investor represent unusually large share recent home purchases. past loan performance indicate investor likely owner-occupants default loan house price decline. when credit standard ease risk layered, institution compensate increase risk mitigate factor support underwrite decision. among credit enhancements, factor generally include require borrower high credit scores, low loan-to-value debt-to-income ratios, significant liquidity net worth. finally, lender establish appropriate allowance estimate credit loss nontraditional mortgage portfolio hold capital commensurate risk characteristic inherent products. one final subject address explicitly draft guidance, i believe still important supervisor bankers, mortgage fraud. there appear substantial upswing suspect fraud relate residential mortgage past decade. type fraud include falsification loan applications, identity theft, misuse loan proceeds, inflate appraisals. accord financial crime enforcement network, 18,000 report suspect mortgage fraud 2004 (the late year complete data), compare few 2,000 report 1997. and first six month 2005 alone, 11,000 report suspect mortgage fraud. the increase may attributable part increase number originator require file suspicious activity report (sars). notably, widespread use nontraditional loan product may present great opportunity fraud, product sometimes lack quality check typical more-traditional mortgages. in general, consider mortgage fraud serious issue one banker supervisor must continue confront. of course, supervisor want hear industry's perspective fraud mortgage lending. commercial real estate the u.s. bank agency recently issue propose guidance commercial real estate (cre) lending. a major portion guidance focus cre concentrations. before i discus importance manage cre concentrations, i want emphasize propose cre guidance relate "true" cre loans. it direct commercial loan bank look business's cash flow source repayment accept real estate collateral secondary source repayment. the propose guidance address bank loan commercial real estate project repayment depend third-party rental income sale, refinancing, permanent finance property. the latter "true" commercial real estate loans, repayment depend condition performance real estate market. i also want mention front propose guidance intend cap restrict banks' participation cre sector rather remind institution proper risk management appropriate capital essential element sound cre lend strategy. in fact, many institution already element place may need adjust practice much. i believe aware central role cre lend play bank problem late 1980s early 1990s. one reason supervisor propose cre guidance point see high rise concentration cre loan relative capital. for certain group banks, asset $100 million $1 billion, average cre concentration level 300 percent total capital. in late 1980s early 1990s, concentration level bank group 150 percent, half current level. therefore, bank surprise emphasis propose cre guidance concentration importance portfolio risk management. historically, cre highly volatile asset class. in past, problem cre, even well-managed banks, generally come time broad market encounter difficulties. in effort generate cash flow, borrower banker property distress may disrupt local real estate market cut rent offer leasehold improvement incentive attract keep tenants. these action negative effect entire local real estate market, include good projects. in years, cre credit loss relatively low compare many type bank loans. but time stress, loss rate jump considerably higher. 4 bi review 57/2006 because cre loss tend great time stress, banker must focus intently risk appetite cre concentration grows. banker must consider much capital place risk cre portfolio hit stress period compare loss exposure relative return cre lending. in words, banker need practice risk management. while banks' underwrite standard generally strong 1980s 1990s, agency propose guidance reinforce sound portfolio-management principle bank place pursue commercial real estate lend strategy. a bank monitor performance individual-loan basis well collective basis loan collateralize similar property type markets. some institutions' strategic- capital-planning process may adequately acknowledge risk cre concentrations. cre lend recent year occur fairly benign credit conditions, condition unlikely continue indefinitely. the ability bank significant concentration weather difficult market condition depend heavily risk-management process level capitalization. from risk-management capital perspective, institution generally focus emerge condition real estate market potential cumulative impact portfolio condition deteriorate; also take measure help identify cre vulnerabilities. of course, measure vary accord size organization level concentration. all step key element sound strategy manage concentrations. while supervisor continue underscore importance robust risk-management practice cre lend concentrations, acknowledge bank may pursue variety approaches. in cases, enough market data available relevant geographic market small, bank may turn less- quantitative approaches. nonetheless, approach robust, well documented, transparent. this consistent broad theme risk management scale institution. along lines, necessarily expect small bank able conduct regular, extensive, sophisticate quantitative stress test around lend concentrations. however, want banker small organization clear coherent method evaluate various potential outcome associate cre concentration exposure broadly. conclusion in past several decades, real estate markets, residential commercial, affect u.s. economy negative positive ways. naturally, federal reserve monitor market gauge impact broad economic activity. in addition, bank substantially involve residential commercial real estate markets, supervisor, must ensure bank lend market conduct safe sound manner. one tool use help maintain safety soundness bank supervisory guidance, point area require additional monitoring, suggest way bank improve risk management, remind banker continue exercise discipline lend activity ensure account risks. the recently issue draft guidance nontraditional mortgage product cre lending, i noted, attempt stifle lend sectors, which, conduct properly, continue profitable business bankers. indeed, recognize important role bank play real estate lending. that want ensure bank maintain good practice operate markets. a final point, set guidance finalized, aim implement consistently possible across institutions. we understand bankers' concern issue. of course, always challenge ensure consistent application guidance throughout industry, especially bank-specific factor - portfolio concentration individual risk-management practice - might affect manner guidance need apply bank. but guidance indeed finalized, plan undertake considerable effort across agencies, include extensive communication coordination, bank subject needlessly differ treatment. bi review 57/2006 5 ben s bernanke: energy economy remark mr ben s bernanke, chairman board governor u federal reserve system, economic club chicago, chicago, 15 june 2006. * * * in remark today, i would like discus relationship energy market economy. a i certain aware, steep increase energy price past several year significant consequence households, businesses, economic policy. at least since time first oil shock october 1973, economist struggle understand way disturbance supply demand balance energy market influence economic growth inflation. at basic level, oil natural gas primary commodities, like tin, rubber, iron ore. yet energy commodity special, part critical input wide variety production process modern economies. they provide fuel drive transportation system, heat home offices, power factories. moreover, energy influence disproportionate share real gross domestic product (gdp) largely limit ability adjust amount energy use per unit output short period time. over long periods, energy consumption alter easily by, example, adjust type vehicle drive, kind home build, variety machine buy. those decisions, turn, influence growth composition stock capital productive capacity economy. over past thirty-five years, u.s. economy experience wide swing energy prices. the oil price increase 1970s follow price decline mid-1980s price spike 1990, numerous fluctuation since then. from mid-1980s fairly recently, market participant tend look price cycle allow longer-term expectation oil price greatly affect short-run swing spot prices. but begin around 2003, future price begin move roughly line rise spot prices. thus, unlike early episodes, significantly high relative price energy experience expect relatively long last thus likely prompt more-significant adjustment household business time. this high relative price energy pose many important question economist policymakers. why price oil natural gas rise much? what outlook energy supply price medium term long term? and implication behavior energy price ongoing economic expansion inflation? i touch briefly questions. development oil market let begin market crude oil. what account behavior current expect future price petroleum? supply demand among valuable concept economist's toolkit, i believe key understand recent prospective development oil markets. for part, high oil price reflect high grow demand oil limit uncertain supplies. on demand side, world oil consumption surge 4 percent 2004 rise solid 2 percent 2003. the rise 2004 much large expect was, fact, large yearly increase quarter-century. a significant part unexpected increase oil consumption year reflect rapidly grow oil use unite state east asia, notably china. in 2005, growth world oil consumption slow 1.3 percent, partly reflect restrain effect high prices. nonetheless, level oil consumption still high relative early expectations. thus far year, underlie demand pressure remain strong context global economy continue expand robustly. on supply side, production oil constrain available capacity, hurricanes, geopolitical developments. in 2003 2004, oil consumption price rise briskly, saudi arabia member organization petroleum export country (opec) pump oil. opec able boost production relatively quickly response change market condition utilize productive capacity idle. by end 2004, however, opec's spare bi review 56/2006 1 production capacity greatly diminished. a consequence, opec's oil production flatten past year even oil price continue soar. oil production outside opec also level last year, contrary early expectation continue growth. this development part reflect devastate effect last year's hurricanes. katrina rita enormously disruptive nation's production energy. at bad point, 1.5 million barrel per day crude oil shut in, virtually u.s. production gulf mexico nearly 2 percent global oil production. recovery oil production gulf slow, disruption last year's storm linger even enter year's hurricane season. the cumulative loss oil production attributable katrina rita amount 160 million barrel oil, figure equivalent nearly half present level commercial crude oil inventory unite states. with background strong demand limit spare capacity, actual production disruption concern reliability security future oil supply contribute volatility oil prices. the oil-rich middle east remain especially unsettle region world, political risk oil supply also emerge nation outside middle east, include russia, venezuela, nigeria. compound difficulty market crude oil constraint disruption refine sector energy industry. in wake hurricane rita, one-quarter domestic refine capacity offline, here, too, period recovery protracted. even last year's hurricanes, however, mismatch appear emerge incremental supply crude oil, tend heavy sulfurous, demand refiner light, sweet crude, convert easily clean-burning transportation fuels. these development highlight need additional investment refine capacity bridge gap upstream supply final demand. what long term? we safely assume world economic growth, together rapid pace industrialization china, india, emerging-market economies, generate increase demand oil form energy. in likelihood, growth demand energy temper extent continue improvement energy efficiency which, turn, stimulate high price ongoing concern security oil supplies. such improvement possible even without technological breakthroughs. for example, japan advance industrial nation us one-half much energy produce dollar's worth real output unite state does. of course, japanese u.s. economy differ important ways, comparison nevertheless suggest scope boost energy efficiency unite state part industrialize world. newly industrialize economy china appear quite inefficient use energy; modernize, adopt energy-saving technique already use elsewhere, energy efficiency presumably improve well. still, global economic expansion continues, substantial growth use oil energy source appear inevitable. how readily supply side oil market respond difficult predict. in physical sense, world imminent danger run oil. at end 2005, world's prove reserve conventional oil - is, oil grind view recoverable use exist technology current economic condition - stand 1.2 trillion barrels, 15 percent high world's prove reserve decade early equal four decade global consumption current rates. these figure include canada's vast deposit oil sands, estimate contain additional 174 billion barrel prove reserves. in addition, today's prove reserve figure ignore potential new discovery also likelihood improve technology high oil price increase amount oil economically recovered. the oil there, whether substantial new source production make available next five year doubt. some important field location technically difficult time-consuming develop, deep-water field coast west africa, gulf mexico, east coast south america. in many cases, development new field also face challenge recover oil without damage delicate ecosystems. perhaps trouble significant uncertainty generate geopolitical instability, i already noted. much world's oil reserve locate area political turmoil violence restrain production investment. bi review 56/2006 2 in develop develop world, another factor hold back investment oil infrastructure concern part producer oil price might fall back 1980s 1990s. in light recognition, oil producer reluctant launch exploration project even today's high prices. such concern reinforce huge reserve oil several opec country could extract low cost sufficient resource expertise direct toward so. development natural gas market the story natural gas share similarity story oil, important difference well. in 1990s, u.s. spot price natural gas henry hub average $2 per million btu. however, recent years, unite state see mark increase price natural gas. the average spot price climb nearly $9 per million btu 2005, price spike $15 per million btu follow hurricane katrina rita. so far year, natural gas price fall back around $7 per million btu unusually warm winter curtail consumption boost natural gas storage record levels. future market currently anticipate price natural gas $9 per million btu next year. why natural gas price rise sharply past years, expect remain elevated? a oil, high price natural gas reflect strong demand diminish supplies. unlike globally integrate market oil, however, natural gas market regional, primarily difficulty transport gas mean pipelines. although world's capacity trade liquefy natural gas, transport ships, growing, still small fraction world supply yet sufficient fully integrate natural gas market across continents. demand natural gas north america remain strong recent years, particularly environmental concern lead clean-burning natural gas become fuel choice new electricity generation. moreover, increase oil price boost demand energy substitute natural gas. however, domestic production natural gas keep up. last year, u.s. production 7 percent 2001 level, le half decline reflect impact hurricane katrina rita. increase trade often mitigate price increases, net import natural gas canada, currently account around 16 percent u.s. consumption, fail increase response high prices. between 1988 2001, net import canada tripled, since flatten out. both u.s. canadian gas field mature yield small increase output, despite incentive high price substantial increase number drill rig operation. trade liquefy natural gas, lng, also likely increase time, perhaps slow pace envisioned. lng import unite state nearly triple 2002 2004, actually fell bite last year production disruption number country limit supply consumer country compete available cargoes. thus, natural gas price likely remain elevate least come years. it possible, however, within decade new supply previously untapped area north america could boost available output here, import lng increase substantial level country seek bring isolate natural gas reserve market. give time, development could serve low natural gas price unite state significantly. nonetheless, high cost produce supply relative traditional source natural gas, well elevate cost energy source oil, natural gas price seem unlikely return level 1990s. thus, supply-demand fundamental seem consistent view take market participant day persistently cheap oil natural gas likely behind us. the good news that, long run, options. i already note scope improvement energy efficiency increase conservation. considerable potential exist well substitute energy source oil natural gas, include coal, nuclear energy, renewable source bio-fuels wind power. give enough time, market mechanism likely increase energy supplies, include alternative energy sources, simultaneously encourage conservation substitution away oil natural gas type energy. bi review 56/2006 3 economic policy implication increase energy price what economic implication high energy price experiencing? in long run, high energy price likely reduce somewhat productive capacity u.s. economy. that outcome would occur, example, high energy cost make business le will invest new capital cause exist capital become economically obsolete. all else equal, effect tend restrain growth labor productivity, turn imply real wage profit low otherwise would been. also, high cost import oil likely adversely affect term trade; is, american sell good service abroad pay give quantity oil imports. for medium term least, high bill oil import increase u.s. current account deficit, imply great need foreign financing. under assumption energy price move sharply high already high levels, long-run effects, though clearly negative, appear manageable. the u.s. economy remarkably flexible, seem absorb cost shock past year dislocations. and conservation development alternative energy source will, long term, ameliorate effect high energy prices. moreover, ongoing productivity gain arise source technological improvement likely exceed significant margin productivity loss create high energy prices. in short run, sharply high energy price create rather different and, ways, difficult set economic challenges. indeed, significant increase energy price simultaneously slow economic growth raise inflation. an increase oil price slow economic growth short run primarily effect consumer spending. because unite state import much oil consumes, increase oil price is, many economist noted, broadly analogous imposition tax u.s. residents, revenue tax go oil producer abroad. in 2004 whole, total cost import oil increase almost $50 billion relative 2003. the import oil bill jump last year additional $70 billion, give price increase experience 2006, appear track increase $50 billion annual rate first half year. couple rise cost import natural gas, cumulative increase import energy cost since end 2003 shape $185 billion - equal almost 1-1/2 percent gdp. all else equal, constitute noticeable drag real household income spending. it tribute underlie strength resiliency u.s. economy able perform well despite drag increase energy prices. at time high oil price slow economic growth, also create inflationary pressures. high price crude oil pass increase price refine product use consumers, gasoline heat oil. when oil price rise, people may try substitute form energy, natural gas, lead price increase alternative well. the rise price pay household energy - example gasoline, heat oil, natural gas - represent, course, increase cost live price inflation. this direct effect high energy price cost live sometimes call first-round effect inflation. in addition, high energy cost may indirect effect inflation rate - if, example, firm pas increase cost production form high consumer price non-energy good service worker respond increase cost live demand high nominal wages. a jump energy cost could also increase public's longer-term inflation expectations, factor would put additional upward pressure inflation. these indirect effect high energy price overall rate inflation call second-round effects. the overall inflation rate reflect first-round second-round effects. economist policymakers also pay attention so-called core inflation rate, exclude direct effect increase price energy (as well food). by strip first-round inflation effects, core inflation provide useful indicator second-round effect increase price energy. in past, notably 1970s early 1980s, first-round second-round effect oil-price increase inflation tend large, firm freely pass rise energy cost consumers, worker react surge cost live ratchet wage demands, longer-run expectation inflation move quickly. in situation, monetary policymaking extremely difficult oil-price increase threaten result large persistent increase overall inflation rate. the federal reserve attempt contain inflationary effect oil- bi review 56/2006 4 price shock engineer sharp increase interest rates, action consequence sharply slow growth raise unemployment, recession begin 1973 1981. since 1980, however, federal reserve central bank work hard bring inflation expectation inflation down. an important benefit effort second-round inflation effect give increase energy price much reduced. to extent household business owner expect feed keep inflation low, firm le incentive le ability pas increase energy cost form high prices, likewise worker le incentive demand compensate increase nominal wages. a i note remark last week, although rate pass-through high energy commodity price core consumer price inflation appear remain relatively low current episode - reflect inflation-fighting credibility build feed recent decade cumulative increase energy commodity price large enough could account recent pickup core inflation. in addition, survey-based measure longer-term inflation expectation edge up, net, recent months, compensation inflation inflation risk imply yield nominal inflation-indexed government debt. a yet, expectation measure remain within range fluctuate recent year inflation compensation imply yield government debt fall back somewhat past month. nevertheless, development bear watching. in conclusion, energy price move considerably since end 2002, reflect supply demand factors. in short run, price likely remain high environment strong world economic growth limit ability increase energy supplies. moreover, price likely volatile near term, give small margin excess capacity produce crude oil natural gas traditionally buff short-run shift supply demand. however, long run, market force respond. the high relative price energy create incentive business create new, energy-saving technology energy consumer adopt them. the market alternative fuel grow rapidly help shift consumption away petroleum-based fuels. government contribute conservation effort work create regulatory environment encourage growth energy supply manner consistent nation's environmental objectives. give extraordinary resilience u.s. economy, i confident nation challenge. bi review 56/2006 5 y v reddy: global imbalance - indian perspective keynote address dr y v reddy, governor reserve bank india, finance development (ffd) office, department economic social office (desa), unite nations, new york, 11 may 2006. * * * honourable under secretary general, mr. ocampo, ambassador nirupam sen distinguish guests, it privilege honor invite unite nation deliver talk 'global imbalances: indian perspective". i would like thank professor jose antonio ocampo, under secretary general, invite deliver talk. in presentation today, i hope capture debate among policy maker well academics; though i must humble presence mr. ocampo minister, professor currently international civil servant eminence. to benefit discussion expect follow, i restrict presentation 30 40 minutes. first, i would like reflect upon international perspective global imbalance raise three issues: (a) essential feature global imbalance stand today, (b) possible cause imbalances, (c) emerge consensus policy responses. second, i attempt highlight india’s perspective global imbalances. while so, i would try cover follow aspects: (a) india’s role global imbalances, (b) approach global consensus cause policy responses, (c) possible impact global imbalance india, (d) emergence oil new factor policy debate global imbalances. third, i shall explore possible agenda analysis enable good understand global imbalances. i. global perspective global imbalance (a) essential feature global imbalance it useful understand different country existence current account surplus deficit inevitable among economy give time. in particular, one argument favor global integration capital may flow develop economy capital starve develop economy imply would current account deficit latter. the problem existence current account deficit surplus per se, persistence large current account deficit large current account surplus, particularly large systemically important economies, give rise fear unsustainabilty disruptive unwinding. (b) possible cause global imbalance the current global imbalance reflect large mismatch current account position country mirror image form domestic saving-investment mismatches. for instance, u current account deficit 6.4 per cent gdp 2005 stand u $805 billion. while current account surplus japan emerge asia account 60 per cent current account deficit us. now, rise oil prices, oil export country also exhibit large current account surpluses. it argue since late 1990s, growth process many emerge market economy (emes), especially asia, come rely heavily external demand. under scenario, felt, many country try maintain external price competitiveness keep currency undervalued. the process, stated, turn, lead large trade current account surplus asian emes large trade current deficit elsewhere world, noticeably us. it also clear sharp deterioration saving-investment balance u recent year along sustain rise consumption demand, could meet rise imports; hence bi review 56/2006 1 rise large current account deficit us. the adverse shift saving-investment balance u reflect high budget deficit since 2002 deterioration net personal save since 1998. (c) the emerge consensus policy response the global imbalance stand today may get correct perhaps could chance le favorable outcome disorderly correction. it hold one scenario could orderly private sector lead adjustment imbalance could materialize even without policy action. it argue that, however slim chance disorderly adjustment, view huge cost disorderly adjustments, public policy cannot afford strive relatively orderly adjustment. in case, felt need good understand policy issue view take appropriate policy action also minimize cost adjustment take place orderly fashion. we viewed, like many others here, sustain increase imbalance current account position across globe could entail serious risk function international monetary system. rebalancing best see process many move part involve major actor global economy. the successful execution rebalancing require careful application traditional macro policy - monetary, fiscal, currency policy - well implementation comprehensive micro agenda structural reforms. a significant part debate seem relative weight accord country various element package aspect coordination among country appropriate. a regard current global initiative correct global imbalances, communiqué issue international monetary financial committee (imfc) release april 22, 2006 highlight action orderly medium-term resolution global imbalance share responsibility, bring great benefit member international community action take individually countries. key element strategy towards orderly resolution global imbalance suggest communiqué follows: • raise national save unite state - measure reduce budget deficit spur private saving; • implement structural reform sustain growth potential boost domestic demand euro area several countries; • further structural reforms, include fiscal consolidation, japan; • allow great exchange rate flexibility number surplus country emerge asia; and, • promote efficient absorption high oil revenue oil-exporting country strong macroeconomic policies. in light above, adjustment generally advocate individual economy region may summarize follows: i. a major challenge u authority could seek policy balance measure boost personal save couple measure cut consumption. however, u policy would need delicately balance gradual withdrawal fiscal stimulus without hurt recovery. it note demand compression could result another recession, would interest global economy. a gradual realignment real exchange rate u dollar couple measure target towards fiscal consolidation generally advocated. have say that, proper calibration would hold key success policy mix important public policy issue. ii. the euro area, continue depend largely external demand, could pursue structural reforms, especially product labor market policies, boost domestic demand broad-base recovery. while sign recovery investment, recognize many progress would helpful foster good integration labor, health care, product, pension financial market reforms. it recognize structural reform nature complex impact best could medium term. iii. we already witness japanese economy way recovery; current account surplus begin narrow background strengthen domestic bi review 56/2006 2 demand, critical. thus, japanese economy expect continue take concrete measure strengthen financial system, restructure corporate sector, reduce large fiscal imbalances. iv. a emerge economies, especially asia, expert suggest growth strategy could reorient towards domestic demand offset possible decline export us. there already sign strengthen domestic demand region. it felt improvement investment climate support high private investment emerge economy important. it argue exchange rate policy may require attention policy maker region. however, others consider exchange rate adjustment may serve interest output employment countries, effectiveness exchange rate adjustment unwind imbalance conclusive. v. the oil export country record large trade surpluses, investment domestic market abroad would help rebalancing global demand. it suggest country could boost expenditure extent area social return high like education, health, infrastructure social security. it felt structural policy strengthen legal economic infrastructure country may help promote investment. however, also argue many oil export country scope domestic absorption limit short run. ii. india’s perspective global imbalance (a) india’s role global imbalance since independence, india move moderate growth path first three decade (1950 1980) high growth trajectory since 1980s. over last two half decades, india emerge one fast grow economy world, average 6 per cent growth rate per annum rank country term size economy, especially purchase power parity (ppp) terms, improved. in last three years, average growth rate 8 per cent. apart register impressive growth rate last two half decades, india’s growth process stable. study indicate yearly variation growth india one lowest. during period, face one crisis 1991. the crisis follow credible macroeconomic structural stabilization programme encompass trade, industry, foreign investment, exchange rate, public finance financial sector. the indian economy late years, could successfully avoid adverse contagion impact shock east asian crisis, russian crisis 1997-98, sanction like situation post-pokhran scenario, border conflict may-june 1999. in context, appropriate view evidence policy follow india way contribute widen current global imbalances: (i) between 2001-02 2003-04, india register modest current account surpluses, reflection phase business cycle, turn around business cycle, india register modest current account deficit last two years. in fact, go current indication projection tenth five year plan, india likely maintain modest sustainable current account deficit near future. (ii) it observe generally current account surplus account considerable proportion reserve accumulation asian emes japan 2000-05. for india, current account surplus minor source reserve accretion. in case, capital flows, oppose current account surpluses, play increasingly important role accumulation reserves. (iii) our approach aim market determine exchange rate predetermine target along market intervention essentially manage volatility serve u well. at empirical level, flexibility indian exchange rate policy capture mark two-way movement indian rupee major currency include u dollar. recent international research viable exchange rate strategy emerge market lend considerable support exchange rate policy follow india. bi review 56/2006 3 (iv) the main driver growth india domestic demand. impressive growth export import strengthen economy ratio export gdp india low emes. (v) the overall improvement gdp growth reform period also facilitate improvement rate aggregate domestic saving. for instance, high growth phase last three years, save rate rise 5.5 percentage point 23.5 per cent 2001-02 29.1 per cent 2004-05. gross domestic investment rate, first time, remain 30 per cent 2004-05, mainly account private investment grow 19.7 per cent. with fiscal responsibility budget management act place, fiscal situation india show improvement recent years. the fiscal consolidation process envisage phase reduction key deficit indicators. monetary policy, supportive investment demand place emphasis price financial stability succeed contain inflation expectations. these factor give confidence possibility sustain present growth momentum – gdp growth close 8 per cent per annum. india has, thus, follow policy serve well also contribute global stability. a mention finance minister, mr. p. chidambaram, expect change basic framework policy term growth base efficient use capital stability assure sound macroeconomic policies. (b) approach global consensus cause policy response we view global developments, particularly world financial markets, direct serious impact finance condition emerge markets. any abrupt disorderly adjustment global imbalance may serious adverse implications. recognise developments, prime minister india, dr. manmohan singh welcome address board governor asian development bank (adb) 39th annual general meet hyderabad, couple week ago, highlight importance correct imbalances. i quote address: “while extent mismatch current account position expect - even desirable - global economy, large disparity raise concern unsustainability hard landings. the process correct imbalance disruptive sudden unexpected. the present level global imbalance cannot sustain forever. it call action country current account surplus current account deficits. a coordinate effort necessary correct imbalance prevent sudden turn. international financial institution need play proactive role regard”. during annual meet adb hyderabad finance minister mr. p. chidambaram dwell length issue global imbalance highlight address global imbalance manner benefit global integration continue uninterrupted fashion. he point asia important role play conjunction country process unwind global imbalance. i quote address: “i must reiterate sustain recovery process correct global imbalance orderly manner, imperative need cooperative approach.” we raise issue global imbalance reserve bank india’s annual report 2002-03 realize time problem potential occupy attention global economy future. the report observed: “although grow imbalance may seem integral feature globalization, nonetheless limit accumulation net claim economy imply persistent current account deficits. the cost service claim add current account deficit and, certain circumstances, destabilizing” the apprehension expressed, retrospect, prove warranted. at juncture, appropriate list important consideration govern initiative regard resolution global imbalance recognize policy initiative may broadly consonance emerge consensus describe early address. bi review 56/2006 4 first, necessary multilateral institution like imf see symmetrical analysis national economy relative position global economy. this would add credibility policy advice could consider country. second, time, action country govern enlighten national interest. it necessary multilateral institution analyze, explore convince policy action would serve long term national interest. third, desirable convince policy maker country action consider appropriate long term interest country itself. in regard, contextual challenge economy give due weight. for example, country like india, employment poverty reduction need give high priority. fourth, essential recognize co-ordination necessary give complex situation neither cause solution clear-cut. a first step, could, however, broad agreement direction first principle appropriate. emphasis harmony policy search co-operative solution appear appropriate. (c) possible impact global imbalance india a highlight finance minister recent adb annual meet apart impact real external sectors, felt development currency capital market intrinsically intertwine global imbalance and, therefore, eventuality disorderly correction, disruption market form large cross-currency volatility sharp rise interest rate likely global economy. what could possible impact le orderly adjustment global imbalance indian economy? india depend international capital market finance fiscal deficit consequently extent adverse consequence global development would muted. however, could spill-over effect global development domestic interest rate thus fisc also. the fiscal position government could also indirectly impact nature management foreign exchange reserve hold reserve bank. similarly, abrupt adjustment global imbalance may affect corporates, bank household india though impact may le emerge economies. with respect impact corporates, widen spread due shift investor confidence international markets, corporates borrow variable rate may possibly suffer those, take loan fix rate basis. corporates hedge currency interest rate risk may escape adverse effects. it may note reserve bank urge bank encourage corporates hedge foreign currency exposures. further, exposure corporate sector whole external debt limit indicative ceiling external commercial borrow impose government reserve bank india. the level total external debt india currently le foreign exchange reserves. although bank india deposit base predominately rupee investment foreign currency asset large, finance investment assets, home loan retail market well equities. like many emes, asset price rise sharply india too. should reversal capital flows, asset price may decline bank exposure risky asset severely restrict reserve bank’s regulatory actions. likewise, equity market also see sustain uptrend effort make reserve bank cap banks’ exposures. further, bank india invest significantly government debt fix income securities. if rise international rate get reflect domestic interest rates, bank mark value investment portfolio. to extent rise international interest rate impact domestic interest rates, would entail marked-to-market loss investment portfolios. however, bank sector acquire add strength absorb probable shocks, largely aid regulatory actions. a regard impact households, risk rise interest rate general could impact house market expose balance sheet household interest rate risk, increase risk loan loss banks. the overall bank sector’s exposure house loan relatively small, adverse development may systemic implication bank sector. bi review 56/2006 5 (d) the emergence oil new factor the emergence large current account surplus among oil export country important recent development. the current account surplus oil export country increase 6.2 per cent gdp 2001 19.1 per cent 2005. le third combine current account surplus oil export country reflect foreign exchange reserve rise u $ 90 billion 2005. the imf (world economic outlook, april 2006) highlight extent high net save oil exporter drive global interest rates, low rate boost demand economy market base financial systems, unite states, oil price shock may also additional negative effect u external position. the fact remain rise oil price would result widen global current account imbalance accord consensus forecast current account balance u project deteriorate 2006. other industrialize economy project run combine surplus lead mainly japan germany. the aggregate current account surplus major oil export country expect increase near term. in regard, may note india’s oil import bill amount 2.9 per cent gdp 2001-02, bill climb 5.5 per cent gdp 2005-06, though volume term increase marginal. iii. agenda analysis in view complex nature global imbalance way forward minimize risk disorderly adjustments, may useful explore possible agenda analysis. first, national balance sheets, mention governor mervyn king, could give special attention get full picture financial claim country countries. look national balance sheet would also useful acquire sense potential adjustment, give sense possible impact relative price change value asset liabilities. the composition size liability asset national balance sheet crucial view together could get global picture. however, look deep balance sheet term disaggregating public private sector component income generate process. a relevant observation perceive high return external asset hold u relative u asset hold rest world. a disaggregation enable analysis role private public sector perpetuation well resolution imbalances. there could dominance bilateral claim private sector one country public private sector country. could dominant bilateral claim become noticeable force allowing, times, non-economic factor play role whole process engagement? second, follow experience east asian crisis 1997-98, private sector vulnerability rather public sector imbalance play key role precipitate crisis, third generation model explicitly bring fore role balance sheet mismatch cause financial crises. a country’s balance sheet evident traditional macroeconomic aggregate could quite sound, yet, analysis composition size liability asset balance sheet domestic entity may useful assess vulnerability manner unwind imbalances. it would therefore useful analyze impact global imbalance various balance sheet within country government sector, financial sector include bank financial institutions, non-financial private sector include corporates households. third, mention earlier, surplus oil export country emerge new factor debate global imbalance. there indication oil surplus deploy diversify avenue official reserves. oil exporter appear take advantage emerge investment opportunity stock market real estate. such inflow could help keep long-term interest rate also emerge market bond spread low, even policy rate rising. an interest issue would nature response unwind global imbalances. fourth, way global imbalance reflection incomplete globalization. if complete globalization, surplus save one country could utilize country deficit save happen among different state india us. it could argue global economy integrate further, resolution global imbalance might smoother. bi review 56/2006 6 fifth, evolve role view exchange rate regime influence domestic economy? it argue emerge evidence indicate domestic price movement remain somewhat immune considerable exchange rate movements. if so, possibility bring global rebalancing exchange rate adjustment may encouraging. no doubt exchange rate would important role play global rebalancing, issue relationship component whole package like saving–investment, fiscal deficit, raise investment, structural reform domestic output well employment. the linkage among various component describe could country specific. sixth, wide diversity among asian economy term save investment rates, fiscal deficit, driver growth (domestic versus external demand) degree flexibility exchange rates. thus, may difficult treat contribute global financial imbalances, manner, would asian economy identically affect adjustment global financial imbalances. correspondingly, policy response country issue would tailor circumstances. more importantly, grow integration among asian economies, would process rebalancing affect depend manner dominant economy asia manage process? seventh, prime minister, professor manmohan singh suggest give potential investment demand region, must find way make good use save find investment avenue within region. in regard, important issue would generation demand within region aggregate current account surplus absorb region itself. this process demand generation would help orderly correction global imbalance eighth, one wonder whether dissonance perception financial market policy maker regard global imbalances. the policy maker appear give signal concern, response financial market often alignment signals. interestingly, anecdotal evidence show analyst financial intermediary sensitive downside risk imbalances, conduct participant reflect awareness. no doubt, sense dissonance new, example, stock market go mr. alan greenspan’s statement regard irrational exuberance. if dissonance true, persists, would effectiveness public policy initiatives? ninth, advantage assess non-quantifiable factor explain persistence state stable disequilibrium describe current status global economy? for example, signature value unite state term confidence financial market last safe-haven status could factor, though issue whether valid interminably. the perception continue productivity gain u due prove flexibility could another. lack alternative deploy global savings, expand may also relevant. no doubt, quantifiable, cease relevant analysis assessment. finally, possible several intermediate scenario orderly adjustment disruptive disorderly adjustments? a series marginal adjustments, often spurts, could take place may appear random, move towards gradual lessen imbalance interactive iterative process encompass markets, national policy global cooperation. the agenda analysis propose may facilitate exploration intermediate scenario unwind global imbalances. conclusion to conclude, performance indian economy since 1980, particular since reform 1990s, many way impressive success story term growth stability. the indian economy respond well rise global competition gradually increase integration world economy. the current high growth phase indian economy also coincide rise domestic save rates. while india hardly contribute current global financial imbalances, large rapid adjustment major currency relate interest rate current account trade partner could indirectly, significantly, impact indian economy. we therefore large stake process unwind global imbalances, will play part ensure successful outcome current initiatives. thank you. bi review 56/2006 7 philipp hildebrand: swiss monetary policy summary speech mr philipp hildebrand, member govern board swiss national bank, annual meet ifz (institute financial service zug), zug, 1 june 2006. the complete speech find german swiss national bank’s website (www.snb.ch). * * * have successfully pursue strategy money supply target around 25 years, swiss national bank (snb) decide adopt fundamentally new monetary policy approach 1999. although integrate important element inflation targeting, le strictly, thus allow great flexibility. money stock credit continue play vital role new concept. unlike european central bank, snb choose make monetary analysis separate pillar concept. an important distinction inflation target monetary policy focus maintain price stability medium long term, inflation target generally orient towards short-term and, cases, variable inflation targets. the snb's monetary policy us inflation forecast central indicator set operational goal form target range three-month libor. a monetary policy gear medium long term afford leeway certain degree stabilisation real economy. the new concept far prove effective turbulent environment, enable snb react major shock independently flexibly. moreover, strengthen confidence successful preservation monetary stability. compare snb’s last quarterly assessment march, many indicator suggest stronger-than-expected growth. however, high commodity prices, rise capital market interest rate turbulence equity foreign exchange market may also present new risks. on whole, still consider strategy gradual normalisation appropriate. should environment change, however, snb hesitate review monetary stance adjust it, necessary. the current cyclical boom obscure fact swiss domestic market still need structural reform ensure sustain economic growth, thus safeguard prosperity prepare economy demographic challenge ahead. bi review 56/2006 1 yiu-kwan choi: the debt market hong kong - offer investors? keynote address mr yiu-kwan choi, deputy chief executive hong kong monetary authority, third annual asia pacific bond congress, hong kong, 13 june 2006. * * * mr. shale, distinguish guest, lady gentlemen, it give great pleasure speak year’s asia pacific bond congress. on behalf hong kong monetary authority, i would like extend warm welcome everyone today, especially travel afar visit us. i would like also thank euromoney organize excellent event, organize hong kong third time. it clear recognition important role hong kong - asia's world city, bond market asia pacific region. like many financial markets, bond market asia pacific region recently see plenty new developments, challenge well opportunities. i glad see congress rightly cover many late issues, i sure yesterday would learn colleague, m julia leung, hong kong monetary authority’s effort enhance regional cooperation. so today would probably useful take minute share hkma develop bond market, importantly, market offer investors. development bond market hong kong let give quick overview current status hong kong dollar debt market. at end 2005, value outstanding hong kong dollar debt reach $660 billion hk dollars, equivalent $85 billion u dollars, 30 time size market 14 year ago. the size hk dollar debt market relative gdp also increase significantly 48% 2005 3% 1991. in 2005, gross issuance hong kong dollar debt reach $400 billion hk dollars, equivalent $51 billion u dollars. everyday, overseas borrowers, financial institution corporation participate actively market. in asia, market high proportion overseas issues, amount outstanding second japan korea. while well develop debt market today, one aware virtually debt market hong kong 90s. because cumulative fiscal surplus, hong kong government find necessary borrow money market time. while good point view fiscal management, conducive debt market development, sense representative yield curve hong kong dollar. a know, liquid deep debt market important component financial centre. the hkma therefore decide develop local debt market two-pronged approach, namely develop market high quality exchange fund paper, build efficient financial infrastructure. a market exchange fund paper in order facilitate development hong kong dollar debt market, hkma roll exchange fund bill note programme 1990. this initiative successful create yield curve hong kong dollar. a today, yield curve extend 10 year serf benchmark debt instrument issue entity local market. in order maintain liquid market exchange fund paper, hkma also put place market-making system market maker oblige quote two-way prices. currently, 26 bank hong kong appoint market makers, tender exchange fund bill note maturity 3 month 10 year hold regularly. these arrangement effective help promote liquidity exchange fund paper enhance credibility hong kong dollar yield curve. indeed, overseas borrower bi review 56/2006 1 remain large issuer market, outstanding debt reach equivalent 32 billion u dollar end 2005, 1.3 billion u dollar end 1997. financial infrastructure let move another important area work: build efficient financial infrastructure bond market. our objective build multi-currencies multi-product payment settlement platform make hong kong payment settlement hub region. we believe safe efficient payment settlement system crucial development debt market. our system serve local investor also investor elsewhere region facilitate fund transfer delivery versus payment buy sell debt instruments. we therefore work actively linkage central moneymarkets unit (the cmu), key custodian system debt instrument hong kong, custodian system region international custodian system euroclear clearstream. these linkage instrumental foster cross-border bond trade investment. with seamless interface cmu real time gross settlement (rtgs) system hong kong hong kong dollar, u dollar euro, transaction debt instrument denominate three currency custodianship cmu settle hong kong dvp basis efficient way. the recent ipo bank china limit probably good example demonstrate efficiency robustness hkd rtgs system: settlement system typically handle average turnover $400 $500 billion hong kong dollar day, saw record high turnover $1.23 trillion 1 june bank china list day. notwithstanding huge amount settlement, inter-bank payment process smoothly day. to develop hong kong payment settlement hub region, continue explore opportunity link rtgs system cmu similar system region. for example, hkma work bank negara malaysia establishment link ringgit rtgs system u dollar rtgs system hong kong. this aim reduce settlement risk ringgit/us dollar foreign exchange transaction pvp settlement asian time zone. the link expect go live end 2006. we explore similar linkage asian central banks. bond price bulletin one factor affect secondary market activity bond market lack information bond prices. to help overcome problem, hkma launch bond price bulletin begin 2006. the bulletin provide investor convenient on-line access information bond product bond price provide eight major bank hong kong. indicative bid/offer price 200 bond different currency issue public private sector entity provide eight contribute banks. outlook let turn talk outlook debt market. notwithstanding achievement make far develop debt market, fully appreciate nothing complacent still many challenge face us. the hkma therefore embark review debt market development view identify measure adopt help market development. on demand side, everybody know mainland china enjoy rapid economic growth business opportunity mushrooming. the recent announcement mainland authority measure liberalise portfolio investment outflow mark emergence kind opportunity hong kong. under new rules, chinese citizen allowed, among things, invest fix income security overseas within certain limits. we expect help boost demand fix income security although know exactly much investment outflow approve mainland authority initial years. bi review 56/2006 2 give experience achievement financial service fact international financial centre china, i sure hong kong well position grasp opportunity. apart initiative development i mentioned, i believe would useful highlight fundamental factor make hong kong ideal place bond market. the first free capital mobility. the absence capital control mean restriction foreign enterprise use capital market raise funds. foreign investor also freely invest market easily remit proceed back home. secondly, well-developed financial markets, include derivative markets, would allow issuer investor manage interest rate risk exchange rate risk effectively. thirdly, hong kong critical mass financial institution stand ready support issuer tap capital markets. hong kong also asset management centre thus provide large investor base debt instruments. last least, absence capital gain tax interest withhold tax would also favour bond market development. our exceptional geographical, cultural language advantage also make hong kong ideal place link mainland china rest world. on part, hkma continue play lead role enhance development debt market hong kong, remove market friction unnecessary restrictions, keep best practice adopt well-developed markets. lastly, i would like thank euromoney invite speak. i look forward continue cooperation partner healthy development bond market region. thank you. bi review 56/2006 3 jean-pierre roth: no news, good news - transparency communication monetary policy address mr jean-pierre roth, chairman govern board swiss national bank chairman board director bank international settlements, annual meet european business press, zurich, 16 june 2006. this paper prepare support martin brown, international research technical assistance section, swiss national bank. * * * introductory remark lady gentlemen, great pleasure address here, occasion annual meeting. i would like take unique opportunity talk issue which, recent years, strongly affect job central bank's president work journalists: transparency communication monetary policy. over past two decades, central banks, especially europe, undoubtedly be-come transparent. central banker regularly communicate assessment inflationary pressure public go great length explain monetary policy stance. go day central bank argue secrecy essential ingredient effective monetary policy. a consequence, monetary policy decision long take irregular interval weekends, order surprise market monday mornings. this, course, fortunate business journalists. you long need spend weekend worry might suddenly start write surprise policy intervention. a may guess though, main reason central bank transparency make weekend relaxing. central banker today pursue policy broad information believe transparency help u fulfil mandate. we convince monetary policy effective least disruptive predictable: news monetary policy good news. in following, i would like discus why, today, central banker think transparency crucial successful monetary policy swiss national bank attempt achieve transparency practice. i shall debate limitation transparency finally, i would like reflect upon transparency monetary policy may affect relationship you, journalists, us, central bankers. 1. the case transparency at swiss national bank see three main reason transparent monetary policy. the first reason count transparency enhance effectiveness monetary policy. in public eye, central bank may view almighty. the plain reality is, however, open market operation direct influence current short-term interest rates. economic activity thus future price development are, however, determine primarily shape yield curve, i.e. expectation future monetary actions. transparency judge future inflationary pressure enable u guide expectation future short-term interest rate thus also long-term interest rates. the second reason transparency reduce inevitable uncertainty relate monetary policy implementation. if market know judge future inflationary pressure may react these, good predict future monetary policy. improve predictability monetary policy lead few painful surprise economy. moreover, le uncertainty monetary policy reduce risk premium financial markets, finance costs. the third rationale central bank transparency public political accountability. central bank mandate act interest country, usually maintain price stability. this imply unpopular decisions, essentially reason central bank independence. . central bank thus free public political pressure. but obvious mechanism must set place ensure accountability independent central banks. transparency monetary policy essential central bank ensure accountability. however, transparency bi review 55/2006 1 enough. the statement make central banker must accessible public must subject scrutiny. here, critical press important role play. 2. communication monetary policy swiss national bank in order improve monetary policy effectiveness enable public accountability swiss national bank start regularly explain monetary policy decision public already 1970's. our first press conference conduct november 1974, shortly collapse bretton-woods fix exchange rate regime. moreover, 1975 onwards publish yearly goal growth monetary aggregate order guide market expectation interest rate inflation. with introduction new monetary policy concept six year ago, take three specific measure order enhance transparency: • first, define consumer price inflation le 2% quantitative goal price stability. this step enhance predictability monetary policy market participant know exactly want achieve. they expect monetary policy tighten believe inflation could exceed 2%. • a second step, regularly publish medium-term inflation forecast. this forecast help market participant predict future monetary policy know goal inflation, also judge future inflationary pressures. • our third step towards transparency explicitly communicate operational target. we announce target 1% band short-term interest rates, is, three-month libor. we thus regularly offer market participant quantitative indicator change monetary policy stance. our experience systematic communication monetary policy past six year positive. market prediction monetary policy measure accurate, lead low volatility financial market improve effectiveness policy measure a prime example recent increase operational target march 2006. an analysis interest rate movement show increase operational target 25 basis point almost fully anticipate financial market prior announcement. contrary many believe, central bank lose prestige see policy correctly anticipate markets. it proof well-understood monetary strategy. 3. credibility - word enough in switzerland, systematic communication monetary policy desire effect get market participant adapt expectation well actual policy intervention made. doe mean swiss national bank indicate intention order influence interest rates? or academic practitioner pose question: central banker replace open market operation "open mouth" interventions? consider recent tighten monetary policy switzerland, one might tempt agree open mouth operation sufficient move interest rates. after all, short-term interest rate rise long increase operational target announce raise actual interest rate repo transactions. however, interpretation data ignore one crucial issue. interest rate move upwards swiss national bank adapt operational target repo rate financial market trust would increase interest rates. give objective previous track record, credible would hike interest rate give economic environment. central bank transparency improve monetary policy effectiveness increase predictability future monetary measures. i would like emphasise predictability rely information communication intentions, also whether public trust central bank realise intentions. central banker thus benefit transparency statement future monetary policy credible. ultimately, know word must match actions. 2 bi review 55/2006 4. transparency press coverage monetary policy lady gentlemen, central bank transparency yield economic benefit enhance monetary policy effectiveness reduce uncertainties. moreover, de-mocratic state, transparency essential independent central bank hold accountable public. i therefore convince central bank around world continue pursue policy openness long time come. this lead important question u here: transparency monetary policy affect future relation press central banks. doe central bank transparency mean future monetary policy boring, press coverage central bank intervention become obsolete? look coverage policy one might incline think so. between 2001 2005, example, swiss national bank mention three time le financial time period 1996 2000. however, let emphasise transparency mean monetary policy always simple predict. remember inflation forecast publish central bank always base expectation future economic developments. hopefully, expectation accurate time. however, certain period economic cycle, particularly turn points, expectation prone correction. i therefore confident that, despite transparency, remain news report monetary policy. i believe, however, central bank transparency may change nature medium report monetary policy. in old day secrecy unexpected monetary interventions, journalist obviously debate objective central banker mean future. with increase transparency, discussion become obsolete, objective seem clear future policy easy predict. in return, central bank transparency give journalist opportunity question consistency monetary policy decision state objectives. this lead believe that, future, medium coverage monetary policy may concentrate scrutinise congruency action goals, rather debate central bank try achieve. a central bank governor, i would certainly welcome development. after all, credibility monetary policy ultimately depend whether public belief match word actions. bi review 55/2006 3 stanley fischer: the israeli economy acceptance speech professor

colleague hebrew university jerusalem. i ask talk today israeli economy. in brief, economy well. it grow 5.2 percent last year, data recent quarter show acceleration growth. current forecast economy grow 5 percent year again. the budget deficit last year 2 percent, likely 1 percent year. our inflation rate low. the exchange rate shekel remarkably stable despite – perhaps – fact bank israel intervene currency market since 1997, intend except truly exceptional situations. we current account surplus. the unemployment rate declining, though unfortunately yet see decline poverty rate. we enter fourth year growth begin middle 2003, end deep recession history israel. that recession start late 2000 result four adverse shock economy: collapse high-tech boom nasdaq bubble enable many israeli high-tech startup flourish; global recession start 2001; tail immigration former soviet union israel; second intifada. it worsen inconsistent set policy response recession. by 2003 global

approach monetary policy, contribute strengthen confidence israeli foreign investor israeli economy. that confidence manifest recovery growth, also relative stability financial market shekel, evident last week general concern emerge market country lead significant currency depreciation sharp stock market decline countries. this impressive performance. but need set perspective. it 2005 per caput

economy grow 5 percent next decade, reach per caput income level $25,500. that would make real difference standard live ability contend range issue face us, include poverty, security situation. what would take keep economy grow rapid rate prolong period? first, factor beyond control: global economy need keep growing. second, factor partly control: security situation. stand here, eastern side jerusalem, view behind u west bank, must aware need find way live palestinian neighbors. third, set factor entirely within control: economic policies. we need general approach economic policy rely primarily market allocate resources, recognize essential role state, especially provision public goods. at time, need accept fact small economy flourish except integrate global economy, israel successfully do past fifty years. indeed, open capital account last fifteen years, end foreign exchange controls, profound positive effect entire economy. in macroeconomic policy, need maintain fiscal discipline serve u well past three years. we still government debt gdp ratio high make u vulnerable serious loss confidence israeli economy, israeli foreigners. to reduce debt gdp ratio need keep budget deficit small, need keep growing. government spend share gdp israel still high international standards, need reduced. tax rate continue decline, already planned. it possible leave room budget increase social essential government spending. we help alleviate poverty short run restore cut welfare spending, particularly elderly disabled, undertake get u economic crisis three year ago. but so, need maintain strengthen incentive work able so. in long run, best way improve welfare poor growth. and long run, growth come primarily technical progress, improvement knowledge ability apply

establish university meet international standard community small yishuv palestine, far center academic life. idealism, zionism, – sadly – destruction jewish community europe, help strengthen university pre- post-world war ii periods. it also small matter establish system high education good israel. but university system serious strain. at one time almost israeli go abroad ph.d's returned. now not. that partly matter relative salaries, also matter unavailability positions. if university remain strong, indeed become stronger, help keep israel scientific frontier, need money. that money come government. some come license sale intellectual property, approach hebrew university successful. 2 bi review 55/2006 but enough. to strengthen universities, sooner late necessary charge student

development address dr shamshad akhtar, governor state bank pakistan, chief guest woodrow wilson centre, washington dc, 24 april 2006. the reference speech find state bank pakistan’s website. * * * i. introduction in line trend world-wide, pakistan adopt liberal market-oriented monetary policy procedure 1990s. this involve move indirect tool monetary policy management major departure age-old practice rely direct interventions, liquidity reserve ratio credit ceiling controls. accompany policy change gradual change legal institutional framework monetary policy formulation, target operate procedure well development infrastructure treasury operation allow effective open market operations. these change subtle profound impact monetary management turn impact economic management pakistan. like several places, however remain level ignorance regard virtue technicality monetary policy management debate key issues. academic often question relevance policy goal tool different ideological stance positioning. structuralists doubt whether monetary policy significant impact, particular price stability. frustration also evident among different economic player force change behavior expectation line tight monetary discipline interest rate adjustments. there le understand patience lag effect monetary policy defuse inflationary pressure ease liquidity conditions. recognize concern debate, pakistan’s central bank regularly review monetary policy line evolve change structure work financial market well broad economic political environment. since mid-1990s, state bank strengthen market-orientation policy implementation, cut reserve requirements, develop open market operations, increase flexibility liquidity management, sharpen focus interest rate maintain reserve money operate target, improve transparency policy signal shorten maturity interest rate serve fulcrum policy. i propose initially provide perspective evolution monetary policy, challenge practical difficulty implementation share monetary policy outlook 2006 finally lead discussion complication challenge conduct monetary policy. ii. policy, legal institutional improvement monetary management monetary policy pakistan year largely supportive dual objective promote economic growth price stability. it achieve goal target monetary aggregate (broad money supply growth intermediate target reserve money operational target) accordance real gdp growth inflation target set government. qualitatively monetary policy formulation implementation improve substantially, benefit follow actions. • first, legislative change state bank pakistan act empower sbp sbp central board formulate, conduct implement monetary policy • second, monetary fiscal board set ensure formal monetary fiscal policy coordination board currently chair prime minister capacity finance minister representation economic ministries. • third, fiscal responsibility debt limitation act 2005 mandate steady reduction revenue deficit zero 30th june 2008 maintain thereafter, reduce total public debt sixty percent gdp 2013 limit thereafter. bi review 55/2006 1 these two principal step lay foundation reduce fiscal subservience monetary policy year serve complicate monetary management allow government unlimited recourse low fix interest rate financing. • fourth, sbp continue refine institutional mechanism monetary policy formulation regular review. for instance, sbp replace open market policy review committee monetary exchange rate policy committee. this committee meet bimonthly establish parameter broad monetary policy review monetary economic condition regular basis recommend change monetary policy instruments. • fifth, sbp treasury's capacity strengthen manage financial market relate activity effectively. proactive conduct monetary operation management market volatility help improve market flows. the open market operation (omo) process institutionalize good flexibility vis-à-vis tenor frequency. from 1995 - 2005, sbp's monetary operation focus t-bill auction predetermine schedule weekly omos fix tenor forecast capability market liquidity. this result high degree volatility overnight (o/n) & shortterm money market rates. during 2005, sbp treasury introduce money market computerize report system (mm-crs) bank help assess market liquidity, improve grip market gap interbank activity, thus strengthen market management capability sbp's forecast capacity. between apr-dec 2005, omos conduct ways, great flexibility tenor frequency. additionally, active swap market help sbp treasury mop-up/inject usd/rupee liquidity money market, required, thus complement monetary management. this result manage excessive market volatility, provide effective signals/direction market set benchmark rupee inter-bank market line monetary policy stance. consequently, o/n rate move within 100bp – 150bp range compare previous trend fluctuate zero 9.0%. iii. monetary outlook 2006 associate challenges. current fiscal year important departure precede years’ monetary stance trend observed. after 3-4 year lax monetary policy, pakistan face significant monetary overhang since growth broad money supply every year exceed growth nominal gdp. since second quarter 2005 monetary policy tighten headline inflation, measure consumer price index (cpi), reach close 11.1 april 2005 - edge beyond yearly target 8% wholesale price index (wpi) point risk move double digits. it recognize give structural issues, inflation threshold develop country high - inflation excess 8- 12% find hurt economic growth.1to start off, sbp raise discount rate 9% april 2005 generate uptrend interest rate t-bill auction sharpen yield curve: 3 month tbill rate rise 4.3 % jan 05 8.1% mid april 2006, 6 month 4.3% 8.3% one year 5% early 05 8.8%. ha monetary tighten achieve desire result i.e. curb inflationary pressures? late trend cpi comfort reveal different level deceleration across cpi category point linger concern whether deceleration continue and/or decline cpi component stay. some number illustrative concern. • while cpi drop 6.9% yoy march 2006 (compared 10.2% record month last year) food inflation fall 5.4% (compared 13.3% march 2005), level decline nonfood inflation modest 8.0% (compared 8.2% march 2005). 1 khan, s. mohsin abdelhak, s. senhadji: threshold effect relationship between inflation growth. imf staff papers, volume 48, number 1, june 2001. 2 bi review 55/2006 • while month month comparison point sharp decline inflation rate, period average cpi 12 month move average cpi still 8.2% 8.6%, respectively target inflation rate 8%. • the core inflation (measuring non-volatile components) however confirm deceleration inflationary pressure core cpi 6.7% march 2006 relative 7.6% march fy05 decline 6.1% (compared 8.0% march 2005), 20% trim mean calculated. iv. reality complication face monetary policy in evaluate effectiveness monetary stance inflation need recognize economic reality complication eventually help develop appropriate policy response. inflation, growth financial development nexus: mohsin s. khan and axel schimmelpfennig (2005)2 conclude inverse relationship inflation real per caput gdp: inflation 8 percent average 1978-1991, per caput growth average 3 percent inflation rise 11% 1992 1997 real per caput growth average 1 percent recover inflation fell 5 percent. further study conclude “the direct inflation-growth nexus suggest threshold range 4 9 percent, inflation-financial development nexus suggest low threshold 3– 6 percent….. base this, recommend sbp adopt inflation target 5 percent.” this evidence arrive base empirical evidence number studies: for instance: • in panel 140 countries, khan senhadji (2001) estimate inflation threshold 1–3 percent industrial country 7–11 percent develop countries. • focus middle east central asian country include pakistan, khan (2005) estimate optimum inflation rate 3 percent argue policy-makers keep inflation 6 percent avoid negative impact growth. • mubarik (2005) use time-series data pakistan 1973 20003 find inflation excess 9 percent harm short-run growth pakistan. • hussain (2005) estimate threshold 4–6 percent beyond inflation adversely affect growth. furthermore, inflation hurt growth make financial intermediation costly high interest rate raise cost low long-run real return corporate sector, introduce adverse selection moral hazard problems. lag transmission mechanism. empirical evidence indicate 6-24 month time lag develop economy transmission monetary policy impact aggregate demand. in pakistan, study point lag range 12-18 months. it tolerance level economy fairly accommodative easy monetary policy adopt fy00-04 remarkable inflation remain low period average level 3.9%. admittedly, fiscal borrow pressure period low also provide scope private sector credit growth. however, monetary overhang year accommodative monetary policy finally generate inflationary pressure remain entrench period. consequent monetary tightening, place one year, eventually show sign transmission channel work evident cpi deceleration. 2 mohsin s. khan axel schimmelpfennig: inflation

management remark m susan schmidt bies, member board governor u federal reserve system, financial women’s association washington briefing, washington dc, 12 june 2006. * * * thank invitation speak today. i impress range interest subject cover program, i hope remark enterprise risk management informative well. today i look recent case believe banker supervisor learn key lesson enterprise risk management, erm. these lesson demonstrate good risk management increase business efficiency profitability. naturally, we've learn bank industry broadly apply industry sectors. indeed, one could argue erm improve management many different type entities, include government agency nonprofit organizations. but i start discuss particular examples, i want take step back give think erm generally. general think enterprise risk management the financial service industry continue evolve meet challenge pose emerge technology business processes, new financial instruments, grow scale scope financial institutions, change regulatory frameworks. the federal reserve, supervisor state member bank bank financial hold companies, work regulator financial institution improve effectiveness relevance regulation supervision change environment. the federal reserve long emphasize need appropriate strong internal control institution supervise, take continuous-improvement approach risk-focused examinations. for many years, enterprise risk management across multiple organizational unit within entity receive increase scrutiny. in cases, firm may practice good risk management exposure-by-exposure basis, may pay close enough attention aggregation exposure across entire organization. rapid growth place considerable pressure on, among areas, organization's management information systems, change-management controls, strategic planning, credit concentrations, asset/liability management. an organization must also understand various business components, quite sophisticate complex, dynamically interact. a successful erm process help organization meet many challenges. of course, enterprise risk management fairly broad topic mean different thing different people. for purpose today, i define erm process enable management effectively deal uncertainty associate risk opportunity, enhance capacity build stakeholder value. borrow erm literature, i would say erm include • align entity's risk appetite strategies, • enhance rigor entity's risk-response decisions, • reduce frequency severity operational surprise losses, • identify manage multiple cross-enterprise risks, • proactively seize opportunity present entity, • improve effectiveness entity's capital deployment. some probably familiar erm framework publish year ago committee sponsor organization treadway commission, coso. the coso framework provide useful way look erm help generate discussion. in coso framework, erm consist eight interrelate component derive way management run enterprise integrate management process: (1) internal environment, (2) objective setting, (3) event identification, (4) risk assessment, (5) risk response, (6) bi review 55/2006 1 control activities, (7) information communication, (8) monitoring. each describe detail coso literature. notably, coso framework state explicitly that, component function identically within every entity, principle apply size institutions. small mid-size entities, example, may choose apply framework le formal le structure way scale need - long quality maintained. this underscore message bank supervisor good risk management expect every institution, regardless size sophistication. naturally, still tension supervisor expect banker do, hope supervisory expectation risk management become align way banker run businesses. i would like discus recent example bank highlight importance erm. with benefit hindsight, financial regulator industry try distill lesson learn recent breakdown risk management internal control financial service sector. compliance risk one area erm provide tangible value area compliance risk, define risk legal regulatory sanctions, financial loss, damage organization's reputation franchise value. this type risk may arise organization fail comply laws, regulations, code conduct applicable business activity functions. the federal reserve expect bank organization place infrastructure identify, monitor, effectively control compliance risk face. needle say, infrastructure commensurate nature organization's compliance risk. for large complex bank organization, deal compliance risk particularly challenge unless well-developed risk-management program. to create appropriate compliance-risk controls, organization first understand compliance risk across entire entity. understandably, daunt task, i think would agree effective risk assessment critical. manager expect evaluate risk control within scope authority least annually. an enterprise-wide compliance-risk management program dynamic proactive. it constantly ass evolve risk new business line activity added, exist activity process alter regulatory changes. the process include assessment change may affect level nature risk exposures, whether mitigate control effective limit exposure target levels. to avoid program operate autopilot, organization must continuously reassess risk control communicate employee part compliance process. if compliance see one-off project, organization risk face situation road compliance program keep change organization. also, board director need ensure organization top-to-bottom compliance culture well communicate senior management staff member understand compliance responsibilities. clear line communication authority help avoid conflict interest. compliance-risk management difficult management integrate organization's regular business process often reflect mandate set legislation regulation organization view key success. for example, banker understand vital credit-risk management interest-rate risk management organizations, reduce volatility earn limit losses. however, regulation enact broad societal purpose view expensive mandate. for example, patriot act require significant report transaction government, many industry express frustration burden associate reporting. i assure you, recognize bank organizations' investment commitment compliance regulatory requirements, include impose anti-money-laundering counter-terrorism regulations. the federal reserve continue work counterpart federal government encourage enhance feedback report contribute common fight money launder terrorism. 2 bi review 55/2006 operational risk over past years, federal reserve increase focus operational risk. for many nonfinancial organizations, large share enterprise risk likely operational risk, oppose credit interest-rate risk. bank learn much practice nonfinancial firm develop years. operational risk relevance today banker largely able shed much interest-rate credit risk sale loans, use financial derivative sound model manage risk retained. further, revenue stream grow fast increasingly relate transaction processing, service accounts, sell sophisticate financial products. to successful, organization must complex system execute activities. bank also utilize advance model estimate manage credit-risk market-risk exposures. grow use sophisticate model require strong risk-management practice since weakness models' operational design data integrity lead significant losses. thus, effective risk management require financial institution more-knowledgeable employee identify system requirements, monitor effectiveness, interpret model result appropriately. we learn quite bite operational risk examination bank organizations. for example, routine examination look adequacy banks' procedures, processes, internal controls. such review include transaction test control routine higher-risk activities. for example, bank's wire transfer activity loan administration function often target review, experience identify common weakness operational control worthy attention. with wire transfer similar transactions, bank organization could suffer significant financial loss unauthorized transfer incur considerable damage reputation operational risk properly mitigated. a recur recommendation review (1) establish reasonable approval authorization requirement wire transaction ensure appropriate level management aware transaction establish good accountability; (2) establish call-back procedures, passwords, fund transfer agreements, authentication control relate customers' wire transfer requests; (3) pay increase attention authentication controls, since area may also particularly susceptible external fraud. loan administration another area bank organization could suffer significant financial loss inappropriate segregation duty lack dual controls. an institution could also incur considerable damage reputation operational risk factor properly mitigated. a recur recommendation type review may apply corporation generally (1) ensure loan officer ability book maintain loans; (2) confine employee access loan system computer application consistent responsibilities; (3) provide line staff consistent guidance, form policy procedures, identify handle unusual transactions. operational risk arise recent financial restatement risk sometimes quickly appear traditionally expected. for example, consider change see financial report quality corporation industries. in 2005, approximately 1,200 restatement previously file financial statement publicly trade company - twice rate 2004. the complexity generally accept account principle stringent, literal interpretation application standard auditor regulatory bodies, primarily security exchange commission, two major factor lead restatements. example prominent restatement include fa 133 hedge account lease account issues. in area hedge accounting, restatement generally result misapplication "short-cut" method. the organization question satisfy criterion use short-cut method but, nonetheless, utilize hedge account treatment allow method. in area lease account issues, company simply fail apply longstanding account standard relate revenue recognition reserves, accrual contingencies, equity accounting. most company believe actually report correctly prior restatements. virtually company audit audit firm register public company bi review 55/2006 3 account oversight board (pcaob). the pcaob's inspection process, involve close scrutiny register firms, may factor increase number restatements. section 404 sarbanes-oxley act 2002 require annual report public company include report management company's internal control financial reporting. restatement bank organization alone result revision number material weakness internal control 2004 report period, fifty-two thirty-seven originally reported. this increase imply significant amount operational risk associate account process. generally, examiner review sarbanes-oxley 404 process determine whether organization clear understand role audit committee, management, internal audit, external auditor whether organization implement effective plan achieve objective requirement sarbanes-oxley 404. examiner also review sarbanes-oxley 404 process determine whether organization effective follow-up strategy remediation significant deficiency material weaknesses. examiner encourage utilize result sarbanes-oxley 404 process, possible, overall assessment organization's risk-management control process risk scoping safety-and-soundness examination inspections. information security issue involve information security identity theft receive quite bite attention federal government past several years. in fact, recently, president bush sign executive order create identity theft task force purpose strengthen federal effort protect identity theft. the head federal bank regulatory agency designate member task force; supervisor financial institutions, i believe offer unique perspective issue. a probably noticed, cyber attack security breach involve nonpublic customer information appear headline almost every week. these event cost financial service industry million dollar direct loss do considerable reputational damage. the cost identity theft affect consumer also significant. with bank organization increasingly use internet interact customers, business partners, service providers, concern use internet communication delivery channel result need use more-sophisticated control mechanisms, enterprise-wide firewall protections, multifactor authentication schemes, virtual private-network connections. while many widely publicize information security breach involve party outside affect bank organization access organization's customer information, organization also remain risk breach misuse information insider. during examination activities, see breakdown internal control, result operate loss trace back weak control insiders' access information technology system interfacing electronic fund transfer networks. further investigation situation suggest duration magnitude fraud result loss direct function internal party's access account relate systems. several lesson emerged. first, institution tightly control logical access fund transfer system ensure access set enforce separation duties, dual controls, management sign-offs. second, institution's senior management restrict regular access business-line functional systems, especially fund transfer systems. when restriction impractical, additional control must place function effectively. finally, effective management information security risk, even focus specific function, require enterprise-wide approach yield true complete evaluation associate risks. mutual fund well-publicized instance late trade market time mutual fund firms, relate investigations, involve many businesses, include banking, securities, insurance firms. these type breakdown internal control result sanction financial loss adversely affect firm's reputation franchise value. 4 bi review 55/2006 i would like highlight lesson learn experience investigate control breach mutual fund cases. one obvious need critically evaluate unusual client relationship require variance standard procedures. if high percentage compensation derive single client, red flag immediately go up. also, organization formal process review approve unique products, customers, service inception client relationship. furthermore, always good idea shine light area historically label "low risk" validate assessment. the low occurrence loss activity factor consider assess risk. finally, compensation system reward employee sale without adequately monitor internal control breach create conflict interest employee interest enterprise. a company move away straight salary incentive-based systems, important personnel department include effective enterprise-wide risk-management program consider change compensation practice affect risk enterprise. credit derivative i would like turn one issue relevance erm, importance company include erm perspective design build new line business. a many might know, last year dialogue supervisor credit derivative dealer initiate support industry effort address weakness operation surround credit default swap (cds). while view new instrument effective way diversify mitigate risk relate credit exposure corporations, industry-led study, counterparty risk management policy group ii report, identify significant weakness infrastructure support sale risk monitor instruments. while report identify forty-seven recommendations, regulator unite state country focus two major weaknesses. one weakness relate lack discipline enforce contract terms. any time instrument trade counter, important know business. since exchange stand two side trade, party make payment directly honor term contracts. the market practice use collateral price mitigate risk side trade cannot perform accord agreement. the recent industry study also find competitive pressure broke enforce standard cd agreement, counterparties routinely assign trade another party without broker's prior consent. a result, dealer often real-time understand counterparty exposure. obviously, significantly change risk profile transaction also make difficult settle payment timely manner. another weakness relate success product. trade volume grow quickly reach significant level broker-dealers' paper-based system record trade document transaction able keep up. a result, significant backlog confirmation over-the-counter derivative build up. this create concern information feed risk-management system - information volume, term, counterparty trade - complete. this problem would exacerbate stress situation, position need change quickly mitigate risk. a month ago, fourteen major market participant publish letter reiterate commitment improve infrastructure support credit derivative markets. the market participant commit development implementation set industrywide guideline include target reduction market participant's confirmation backlog assurance agreement term enforced. additionally, fourteen participant work create largely electronic marketplace trade process industry-accepted platform, develop new set process standard trade cannot confirm electronically, establish new procedure settlement follow credit event. we generally please industry's self-identification issue commitment make improvements. but purpose discussion erm today, problem surround cd sale highlight challenge risk manager face market pressure make firm's line management reluctant initiate appropriate control own. it also illustrate new line business, sometimes erm must go outside enterprise work competitor support growth share system standard mitigate risks. bi review 55/2006 5 conclusion at federal reserve, believe bank organization need good risk management. an enterprise-wide approach appropriate set objective across organization, instill enterprise-wide culture, ensure key activity risk monitor regularly. in many ways, banker learn nonfinancial industry erm. in cases, banks' application erm may hold lesson entity outside financial sector. whichever case, clear always opportunity improve upon erm strategy maintain proper discipline implement effectively. 6 bi review 55/2006 timothy f geithner: uncertainty transparency conduct monetary policy remark mr timothy f geithner, president chief executive officer federal reserve bank new york, financial service leadership forum breakfast, new york city, 31 may 2006. * * * at jackson hole symposium 2003, alan greenspan remark "uncertainty important feature monetary policy landscape; define characteristic landscape." historically, pervasive uncertainty associate tendency toward opacity part central bankers. but recent year we've see rather dramatic reversal tendency central banker come recognize potentially valuable role communication financial market general public play achievement monetary policy goals. while transparency emerge one hallmark modern central banking, appreciation challenge communicate policy uncertainty. this challenge substantial. it mean convey likely trajectory key economic variables, also uncertainty around trajectory perhaps indication policy might react myriad way uncertainty could resolved. i want devote remark today explore means, mean, central bank communicate effective way policy face uncertainty. the issue communication particularly relevant current economic environment. for much past three years, financial market reflect high degree certainty near-term outlook monetary policy unite states. market expectation week precede last 16 federal open market committee (fomc) meet attach probability close one fomc would raise target federal fund rate 25 basis points. also, little probability attach inter-meeting move period, move increment large 25 basis points. and, although market expectation far fomc would ultimately move revise significantly course period economic outlook revised, change occur without committee need deviate near-term path. this period unusual certainty path feed fund rate result confluence factors. when committee first move tighten policy june 2004, feed fund rate historic low 1 percent, clear policy would move substantial distance get back within range plausible estimate neutral rate. over course follow month incoming data tend reinforce case progressive move target rate. and, committee make conscious decision signal view likely path growth inflation tighten monetary policy necessary could achieve relatively gradual pace. we process emerge rather exceptional period, provide u interest context reflect uncertainty affect conduct monetary policy communication monetary policy. the degree confidence sign shape near-term path feed fund rate we've see recent year unlikely common feature monetary policy unite state countries. the simple reason economic circumstance precipitate policy also typical. there likely time incoming data deviate substantially persistently forecasts. in situations, policymakers examine whether significantly misestimate certain fundamental feature economy, nairu trend productivity growth rate, might alter appropriate course monetary policy. central bank everywhere conduct policy state limit knowledge economy best achieve objectives. the source uncertainty confront many varied. sometimes, think know economy work turn wrong, either certain feature economy changed, understand right first place. it widely hold monetary policy could achieve somewhat low rate unemployment allow somewhat high rate inflation, could without risk bi review 54/2006 1 substantial acceleration inflation. this view prove mistake correctly account role inflation expectation play inflation dynamics. economic concept critical understand economy may difficult impossible capture practice. one concept neutral equilibrium interest rate, rate that, sustain period time, likely consistent economy grow potential low inflation. plausible estimate prevail level rate range least 100 basis points, center estimate tend move around quite bit. another concept difficult estimate precisely economy's potential, sustainable, growth rate. the acceleration productivity growth unite state late 1990s, example, lead u revise estimate fast economy likely able grow time without undermine price stability. we also face considerable ignorance precise channel policy action ultimately affect economy, well long effect take show large show up. a would expect, make difficult ass advance, even real time, amount loosen tighten likely necessary achieve goal central banks. even precise knowledge key economic relationships, ability ass economic condition real time would impede data limitations. though modern central bank implicitly explicitly target measure inflation, host issue surround proper definition measurement inflation policy purpose daunting. in general, economic data subject sample error cannot simply take face value. also, many series rely subject revision good information become available, potentially even redefine way make history series le useful interpret current movements. finally, data often report significant enough delay limit use read current conditions. but, even know model data certainty, impossible perfectly predict evolution factor largely beyond influence current monetary policy would likely affect policy today know sure would look tomorrow. one way say simply cannot know type "shocks" likely hit economy hit. and even impact economy, appropriate policy response may obvious may difficult ass real time probable duration shock whether demand drive supply driven. even one-year horizon, policy purpose long time, considerable uncertainty surround forecast gdp growth. for example, survey professional forecaster report average 50 economist attach 90 percent probability outcome real gdp growth 2007 range 1.0 percent 5.0 percent. the width band confidence uncertainty similar publish forecast many central banks. the type fundamental uncertainty i review always present, impact appropriate near-term trajectory rates, hence degree confidence central bank convey trajectory, may vary substantially time. i want mention concrete example uncertainty currently face. the late wave global economic integration influence inflation output dynamic around world way may hard understand fully real time. technological progress, along transition great labor force participation emerge develop economy probably serve keep inflation low many country serve increase rate growth potential output globally. but rapid growth market sector emerge develop economy may also contribute rapid growth global demand inflation pressures. this change configuration world market complicate task forecast inflation output within national economies. energy price surprise u past years, term extent rise prices, increase volatility, limit negative effect date global economic growth. our capacity project future energy price prove limited, ability convincingly ascertain extent temporary supply factors, rather unrecognized strength global demand, account energy price trajectory we've witness recently. the consequence limit knowledge may even great give extent price increase already experienced. 2 bi review 54/2006 the

economy, much world economy, strong today. but aspect uncertainly help illustrate make monetary policy interesting, help explain central bank may confront wide band uncertainty around even strong central outlook. they also emphasize importance process use make decision policy state limit knowledge. policymakers use range approach deal uncertainty. in addition make substantial investment try capture change economic activity may fully evident national data, typically spend lot time look assumption underpin central forecast, sensitivity forecast possibility assumption prove wrong. we regularly systematically examine range alternative scenario attempt capture broad range different path main force operate economy. these scenario include seem highly implausible might prove damaging, well seem plausible might alter outlook less. to complement this, look implication monetary policy alternative scenario outlook—what world move different direction. and also look impact outlook growth inflation different path feed fund rate. these approach help illustrate size source uncertainty live moment. they give u capacity attach precise probability alternative scenario quantify precision implications, help frame discussion material risk outlook potential consequence different type policy mistakes. and help inform choice central bank affect expectation future interest rates. along analytical tools, many central bank adopt decisionmaking structure design bring diversity independent perspective table. although fomc's discussion begin presentation forecast prepare staff federal reserve board, committee member bring discussion substantial information base independent effort understand underlie dynamic demand inflation implication monetary policy. this provide strong foundation decisions, particularly uncertainty inherently great. central bank adopt different approach challenge, even broad convergence toward model independent central banks, explicit mandate include price stability great disclosure transparency. the central bank publish quantitative forecast growth inflation typically show confidence band around forecasts. in cases, forecast use, condition assumption, financial market expectation path short-term interest rates. in others, central bank publish forecast include central bank's assessment time likely path monetary policy horizon. in former case, implication forecast monetary policy leave implicit. in latter case, likely path monetary policy make explicit, path heavily qualify condition make clear expect path short-term interest rate change condition change. the fomc's approach communication differ interest important way models. although committee introduce gradual mark increase degree communication past two decades, provide information forecast quantitative term le frequently le detail become typical many central banks. and bi review 54/2006 3 yet, unique circumstance past two three years, provide information near-term path monetary policy practice many counterparts. these difference approach communication seem reflect fundamental difference perception degree nature uncertainty. the proponent regime explicit forecast great disclosure future path interest rate claim great confidence ability forecast. they express, however, great comfort potentially adverse consequence approaches, tendency, example, observer gravitate toward central tendency forecast look past uncertainty band qualifications. and express le concern approach communication end limit flexibility central bank react circumstance change without induce damage volatility markets. and so, even central bank move vary degree toward great clarity goals, forecast policy decisions, also move explicit uncertainty need flexibility policy adjust time. this reflect evolve appreciation limit transparency. transparency monetary policy cannot mean central bank convey confidence outlook growth inflation reasonably have, cannot provide assurance likely future course policy actually has. this seem self evident. and yet central bank move communicate disclose monetary policy, transparency monetary policy associate rise expectation clarity path target interest rate time. it might seem desirable ideal state world expectation financial market future course policy closely track real time central bank. but give degree uncertainty surround monetary policy making, unlikely possible, except special circumstances. there circumstance appropriate central bank send signal target rate extend well beyond immediate horizon. these circumstance likely arise frequently, appropriate particular condition benefit afford effect expectation clearly outweigh cost impose loss flexibility. central bank clear try achieve. they open knowledge insight possess. and provide public clarity attainable. but also need convey limit knowledge avoid provide sense certainty not, cannot, possess. uncertainty strengthen case open know, explore robustness decision range alternative scenarios. but uncertainty also reinforce case clarity communication objective guide policy rationale decisions. perhaps crucially, mean preserve confidence commitment keep underlie inflation low time, retain capacity respond flexibility challenge face uncertain world. thank you. 4 bi review 54/2006 guy quaden: review significant event 2005

contain annual account year describe governance enterprise. a number question send u shareholders, particularly deminor company, subject bank’s corporate governance statement. why conform lippens code bank list company, explain, code’s provisions, reason conform it? first, must remember special legal framework govern institution specific position central bank mean cannot systematically compare governance “lippens code” recommendations. the belgian corporate governance code, supplement ordinary legislation list companies, affirm code’s character recommendation. it cannot replace exist law treaties, particularly applicable bank. the bank fact govern first provision maastricht treaty, organic law bi review 54/2006 1 statutes, finally – purely additional basis – company code. the bank therefore subject legal rule public limit liability companies. furthermore, lippens code inappropriate special characteristic bank, company – unlike list company - aim primarily maximise profit, which, accordance treaty law, promote monetary financial stability public interest. it dominance public interest cause legislature determine composition power bank’s organs. these different company address belgian governance code. while organ conventional company administrative board, general meet and, perhaps management board chief executive, organ bank governor, board directors, council regency board censors. the special arrangement appointment member organs, specific composition role council regency, provision exercise supervision example way dominance public interest reflect bank’s special governance structure. this also explanation quite specific role belgian state, involve shareholder sovereign state. it act primarily sovereign state grant bank right issue priority right result profits. however, national bank always scrupulous ensure compliance ethical principle value underlie belgian corporate governance code. it say system governance control impose u exact recommend belgian corporate governance code, respect even so. in fact, member european system central banks, bank subject special rule obligation apply belgian companies. moreover, i feel company publish detail information contain part 2 bank’s annual report, receive available bank’s website. that demonstrate desire act correctly provide possible information public, particularly shareholders, operation institution. * * * a 2003 2004, judgment hand 2005 early 2006 follow legal action bring certain shareholder find favour bank. thus, 27 october 2005, brussels commercial court confirmed, court arbitration already do 2003, bank lose right issue therefore liquidate reserve fund. since start monetary union, bank fact share right issue euro banknote european central bank eleven national central bank eurosystem. a second judgment pass 2 february 2006, brussels commercial court, concern write-back provision future foreign exchange losses, effect end 2003 financial year intend adjust amount provision line change currency risk. the amount write-back include bank’s financial income share bank state. the brussels commercial court reject demand make certain shareholder cancel decision, confirm annual account 2003 perfectly legal. in help clarify status institution shed light special characteristics, court decision put end certain argument reduce fluctuation bank’s share price. in foreword annual report, i mention unjustified speculation concern shares, i mean fluctuation originate legal argument consider incorrect, judgment far also refuted. * * * in 2005, bank’s profit

risk management", bangalore, 12 may 2006. the assistance shri k damodaran prepare address gratefully acknowledged. * * * lady gentlemen, pleasure program emerge paradigm risk management. a expect me, address today, i intend share broad contour regulatory approach, process think regard issue arise context basel ii. basel ii aim encourage use modern risk management techniques; encourage bank ensure risk management capability commensurate risk business. previously, regulators' main focus credit risk market risk. basel ii take sophisticate approach credit risk, allow bank make use internal rat base approach - "irb approach" become know - calculate capital requirement credit risk. it also introduces, addition market risk capital charge, explicit capital charge operational risk. together, three risk - credit, market, operational risk - so-called "pillar 1" risks. banks' risk management function need look much wide range risk - interest rate risk bank book, foreign exchange risk, liquidity risk, business cycle risk, reputation risk, strategic risk. the risk management role help identify, evaluate, monitor, manage control mitigate risk become crucial role modern-day banking. indeed, probably exaggerate importance say quality bank's risk management become one key determinant success bank. the policy approach basel ii india conform best international standard process emphasis harmonization international best practices. commercial bank india start implement basel ii effect march 31, 2007 though, indicate governor, marginal stretch beyond date cannot rule view late indication state preparedness. though basel ii framework provide various option implementation, special attention give difference degree sophistication development bank system consider option decide bank india initially adopt standardise approach (sa) credit risk basic indicator approach (bia) operational risk. the prime consideration decide likely approach include cost implementation cost compliance. before come specific i may like mention overall capital make financial system stable. in general, expect loss cover earn provision hence need price risk appropriately. unexpected loss loss beyond normal range expectation need meet capital. let briefly review step take implementation basel ii emerge issues. • the rbi announce annual policy statement may 2004 bank india examine depth option available basel ii draw road-map end-december 2004 migration basel ii review progress make quarterly intervals. • the reserve bank organize two-day seminar july 2004 mainly sensitise chief executive officer bank opportunity challenge emerge basel ii norms. • soon thereafter bank advise august 2004 undertake self-assessment various risk management system place, specific reference three major risk cover basel ii initiate necessary remedial measure update system match minimum standard prescribe new framework. • bank also advise formulate operationalise capital adequacy assessment process (caap) require pillar ii new framework. bi review 54/2006 1 • reserve bank issue guidance note operational risk management november 2005, serf benchmark bank establish scientific operational risk management framework. • we try ensure bank suitable risk management framework orient towards requirement dictate size complexity business, risk philosophy, market perception expect level capital. • risk base supervision (rbs) 23 bank introduce pilot basis. • a per normal practice, view ensure migration basel ii non-disruptive manner, consultative participative approach adopt design implement basel ii. a steer committee comprise senior official 14 bank (public, private foreign) constitute wherein representation indian banks’ association rbi ensured. the steer committee form sub-groups address specific issues. on basis recommendation steer committee, draft guideline bank implementation new capital adequacy framework issued. • the reserve bank constitute sub group steer committee make recommendation guideline may require issue bank regard pillar 2 aspects. the guideline regard pillar 2 aspect propose issue would cover bank level initiative may require pillar 2. the underlie philosophy prescribe basel ii principle indian bank sector must result segmentation sector. accordingly, decide schedule commercial bank india, big small, shall implement standardise approach credit risk basic indicator approach operational risk effect march 31, 2007. however, exist three-tier structure respect scbs, cooperative bank rrbs may continue. currently, commercial bank require maintain capital credit market risk per basel i framework; cooperative banks, second track, require maintain capital credit risk per basel i framework surrogate market risk; regional rural banks, third track, minimum capital requirement is, however, par basel i framework. by opt migrate basel ii basic level, reserve bank considerably reduce basel ii compliance cost system. in way, elementary approach identify indian bank system similar basel i methodology. for instance, a) change methodology compute capital charge market risk basel i basel ii; b) computation capital charge operational risk bia simple involve compliance cost; c) computation capital charge credit risk involve compilation information marginally granular level, expect achieve slight re-orientation exist mis. in circumstances, might entirely correct assessment implementation elementary level basel ii significantly increase cost regulatory compliance. no doubt additional capital would required, cushion available system, present capital risk asset ratio (crar) 12 per cent, provide comfort. the bank also start explore various avenue meet capital requirements. the reserve bank has, part, issue policy guideline enable issuance several instrument bank viz., innovative perpetual debt instruments, perpetual non-cumulative preference shares, redeemable cumulative preference share hybrid debt instrument enhance capital raise options. with view objective assessment true cost implementation basel ii, bank would well advise institute internal study make true assessment cost involve – exclusively elementary approaches. the informal feedback bank reflect see basel ii implementation ‘costly’ proposition. however, bank need ensure expenditure incur improve risk management systems, it infrastructure, core bank solutions, risk model etc. include basel ii 2 bi review 54/2006 compliance costs, since expense bank would incur even normal course business improve efficiencies. operational risk operational risk one area expect increase capital requirement banks. the reserve bank announce july 2004 bank india adopt basic indicator approach operational risk. this follow draft guideline basel ii framework february 2005 methodology compute capital requirement basic indicator approach explain banks. even system level, find crar bank present well 12 per cent. this reflect adequate cushion system meet capital requirement operational risks, without breach minimum crar. there also perception capital requirement operational risk low advance approach rather basic indicator approach. i feel that, absence detail quality operational risk management system bank operational risk loss experience, may correct bank assume adoption advance approach would result less capital bia. have address specific issue i suppose 'brief', let turn important issues. rat agency in term basel ii requirements, national supervisor responsible determine whether rat agency meet eligibility criteria. the criterion specify objectivity assessment methodology, independence pressures, transparency, adequate disclosures, sufficient resource high quality credit assessment credibility. india four rat agency three own partly/wholly international rat agencies. compare develop countries, extent rat penetration increase every year large number capital issue company rated. however, since rat issue issuers, likely result, effect, application basel i standard credit risk respect non-retail exposures. while basel ii provide scope extend rat issue issuers, would approximation would necessary system move rat issuers. encourage rat issuer would essential regard. an internal work group examine process identification domestic credit rat agency would meet eligibility criterion prescribe basel ii. it expect process would soon bank would inform detail rat agency qualify. thereafter, borrower expect approach rat agency get rated, fail bank would constrain assign 100% risk weight minimum unrated borrowers. the reserve bank invite four rat agency make presentation eligibility criterion self assessment regard criteria. the rat agency since make presentation examination vis-à-vis eligibility criterion recognise rat agencies, whose rat use bank risk weight purposes. migration advance approach after adequate skill developed, bank also supervisors, bank may allow migrate internal rat base (irb) approach. the obvious corollary bank expect migrate advance approach – though time, immediately. hence, small bank would well advise focus resource understand mechanic function elementary approach identify minimum requirement approach demand. it would interest take necessary initiative make implementation elementary approach effective meaningful. a well establish risk management system pre-requisite implementation advance approach new capital adequacy framework, bank require examine various bi review 54/2006 3 option available framework lay road-map migration basel ii. the feedback receive bank suggest bank may keen implement advance approach fully equip straightaway are, therefore, look forward migrate advance approach late date. basel ii provide bank allow adopt / migrate advance approach specific approval supervisor, ensure meet / satisfy minimum requirement specify framework, time adoption / migration, continue basis. [the minimum requirement meet bank relate (a) internal rat system design, (b) risk rat system operations, (c) corporate governance oversight, (d) use internal ratings, (e) risk quantification, (f) validation internal estimates, (g) requirement recognition leasing, (h) calculation capital charge equity exposure (i) disclosure requirements.] hence, necessary bank desirous adopt advance approach stringent assessment compliance minimum requirement shift gear migrate approaches. in context, current non-availability acceptable qualitative historical data relevant ratings, along relate cost involve build maintain requisite database, influence pace migration advance approach available basel ii. bank internationally active look significantly improve risk management system migrate advance approach basel ii since require compete international bank adopt advance approaches. this strategy would also relevant bank look adoption advance approaches. a aware adoption advance approach might help bank maintain low capital. however, would relevant refer inverse relationship capital requirement information needs. adoption advance approach require adoption superior technology information system aid bank good data collection, support high quality data provide scope detail technical analysis - essential advance approaches. hence, bank aim maintain low capital adopt advance approach would also prepare meet high information needs. while migration advance approach basically business decision, i would like mention thing may perhaps influence decisions: • implementation advance approach basel ii mandatory small bank undertake traditional bank business regional limit presence. • implementation advance approach basel ii consider fashionable implementation elementary approach consider inferior. • any decision migrate advance approach well deliberated, conscious decision bank’s board, take account, capacity compute capital requirement approach also capacity sustain bank’s risk profile consequent capital level various scenarios, especially stress scenarios. • the precondition migration advance approach would include (a) well established, efficient independent risk management framework; (b) support well established, efficient it mi infrastructure; (c) cost benefit analysis adoption advance approaches; (d) availability appropriate skill capacity retain / attract skill point time; (e) well established, effective independent internal control mechanism supplement risk management systems. i hope subsequent session would discus great detail issues. it important sector whole appreciate internalize basic philosophy basel ii, attendant cost benefits. undoubtedly discipline risk management significantly alter ethos bank economic activity. but one point i would like stress conclusion bank view opportunity open complex financial instrument perspective large systemic interest. today internationally, market discipline consider integral part regulatory framework, imperative bank realize equal partner ensure financial stability; involve help build risk management culture across stakeholders. 4 bi review 54/2006 any distortion bring misalignment risk need product offer address risk harm arrest development healthy market. bi review 54/2006 5 ben s bernanke: increase economic opportunity - challenge strategy remark mr ben s bernanke, chairman board governor u federal reserve system, fifteenth congressional district texas’ fifth regional issue conference, washington dc, 13 june 2006. * * * i please discus strategy help families, particularly lower-income families, improve economic financial well-being. family today face financial marketplace increasingly complex, numerous product service provider choose. today i touch several approach help people modest mean take advantage financial opportunity manage risk avoid possible pitfalls. today’s financial marketplace technological advance dramatically transform provision financial product service recent years. to cite one example, expand use computerize credit-scoring models, reduce cost make loan increase range asset lender sell secondary market, make possible extension credit large group borrowers. indeed, see increasingly wide array product offer consumer across range incomes, lead call democratization credit. likewise, technological innovation enhance financial services, bank services, increase variety financial product available savers. the range provider consumer financial market also increased, number nonbank entity offer credit financial service rise particularly quickly. for example, recent study alternative provider financial service find number nonbank check-cashing establishment double unite state 1996 2001.1 payday lend outlets, source credit almost non-existent decade ago, number 10,000. and data survey consumer finances, triennial survey sponsor federal reserve board, indicate share household loan finance company increase 13 percent 1992 25 percent 2004. financial challenge lower-income family despite increase complexity financial product wide availability credit many forms, u.s. household overall manage personal finance well. on average, debt burden appear manageable levels, delinquency rate consumer loan home mortgage low. measure relative disposable income, household net worth fairly high level, although still peak reach early decade. family low moderate incomes, however, face special financial challenges. these family generally le cushion absorb unanticipated expense deal adverse circumstances, loss employment serious health problem. result survey consumer finance show median net worth household low income quintile--those whose income place bottom fifth population--was $7,500 2004, well median survey respondent $93,000.2 the survey data also indicate household low quintile significantly le likely average respondent maintain check save account; almost 25 percent family "unbanked," compare le 10 percent family income quintiles. the reason give account varied: some respondent say would write enough check make 1 kenneth temkin noah sawyer (2004), "analysis alternative financial service provider (781 kb pdf)," report prepare fannie mae foundation urban institute metropolitan house community policy center. 2 brian k. bucks, arthur b. kennickell, kevin b. moore (2006), "recent change u.s. family finances: evidence 2001 2004 survey consumer finance (448 kb pdf)," federal reserve bulletin. bi review 54/2006 1 account worthwhile, others dissuade minimum balance requirement say enough money justify open account. in cases, lack knowledge service bank offer even distrust bank likely factor. the survey also find lower-income household le able others manage debts. a great fraction household debt-to-income ratio 40 percent payment past due least sixty days. the data also reveal 40 percent family low quintile home, compare homeownership rate 69 percent among family surveyed. finally, data retirement account ownership show even large gap, 10 percent lowest-quintile family hold retirement account, whereas 50 percent family respond survey report participation type retirement save plan. how disparity addressed? some general approach help family modest mean build asset improve economic well-being include community economic development, financial education, program encourage save investment. in remainder remarks, i discus approach briefly offer insight effectiveness base research experience. community economic development in time federal reserve, i number opportunity meet community economic development leaders--representatives group work assist lower-income family become homeowners, start small businesses, good manage finances, save future. in fact, first trip federal reserve board member brownsville, texas, i saw grassroots nonprofit organization help build community provide resident chance build wealth homeownership. the community development corporation (cdc) brownsville work multiple fund partners--governments levels, financial institutions, foundations, corporations--to construct house design innovative loan product enable low-income family qualify mortgage credit. for example, mix fund sources, mortgage loan offer feature down-payment assistance below-market interest rate. the cdc brownsville also offer program allow prospective homeowner acquire "sweat equity" property work construction team help build new home participate families. a case many community development organizations, brownsville cdc also make financial education critical element effort help lower-income resident improve financial status. for example, participation financial counsel education program typically require borrower obtain loan cdc one lend partners. however, broad aim program improve borrowers’ prospect longer-term success maintain credit handle overall finances. since 1994, combination leverage finance arrangement borrower education, cdc brownsville help make homeownership possible 2,500 low-income families. i cite brownsville example opportunity i learn work (and i recently similar opportunity see impressive community development effort anacostia neighborhood district columbia). but localize approach community development wealth-building play neighborhood throughout country, case strategy tailor distinct need particular community. financial education financial literacy financial education integral community development also begin play large role broad consumer market. clearly, choose wisely wide variety financial product provider available, consumer must least basic financial knowledge. people understand financial aspect purchase home start business, appreciate importance save children’s education retirement, almost certainly economically good without vital information. financial literacy acquire many channels: school, job, community program counseling, self-education experience. study generally find people receive financial education counsel good financial outcomes. for example, research analyze data nearly 40,000 mortgage loan target 2 bi review 54/2006 lower-income borrower find family receive individual financial counsel le likely late become delinquent mortgage payments.3 similarly, another study find borrower seek receive assistance credit counsel agency improve credit management, particular, reduce number credit account carry positive balances, cut overall debt, reduce delinquency rates.4 more broadly, research show financial knowledge correlate good financial outcomes; example, individual familiar basic financial concept product find likely balance checkbook every month, budget savings, hold investment accounts.5studies establish association financial knowledge good financial outcome encouraging, necessarily prove financial train counsel cause good outcomes. it could be, example, counsel associate good financial outcome consumer choose seek counsel one already good inform motivate make good financial decisions. in medicine fields, researcher gain good understand cause control studies, subject randomly assign particular treatment others receive it. to translate idea analysis effect financial counseling, federal reserve board’s division consumer community affair collaborate department defense conduct three-year study effect financial education. this study evaluate impact various educational program financial decision soldier families. it include treatment group receive financial education, program family receive receive determine randomly, control group similar soldier family receive formal financial education. because assignment individual program random, observe change behavior reliably attribute type amount counsel received. among things, result study help u good understand whether financial education lead change behavior participant general critical teach moments, period make major financial decision choose mortgage. i would like say word federal reserve’s broad role promote consumers’ understand financial product services. beyond conduct survey consumer research, work number way support consumer financial decisionmaking. for example, consumer protection rule-writing authority, federal reserve set requirement specify information must disclose consumer term fee associate credit deposit accounts. these disclosure provide consumer essential information need ass cost benefit financial service compare product among different providers. we currently review many disclosure plan use focus group method try make disclosure clear user-friendly possible. the federal reserve system also work promote financial education financial literacy various outreach educational activities. we provide great deal substantive financial information, include interactive tool economic education, education website http://www.federalreserveeducation.org/. the website link wide variety financial education resource local, regional, national levels. additionally, federal reserve board collaborate educational community development organization support efforts. our national partner include jump$tart coalition personal financial literacy, conference mayors’ dollarwi$e campaign, operation hope, american save education council, america saves, among others. at regional level, twelve federal reserve bank work organization support financial education financial 3 abdighani hirad peter m. zorn (2001), "a little knowledge be good thing: empirical evidence effectiveness pre-purchase homeownership counsel (466 kb pdf)," paper present "seeds growth - sustainable communitydevelopment: what works, what doesn’t why?" 4 gregory elliehausen, e. christopher lundquist, michael e. staten (2003), "the impact credit counsel subsequent borrower credit usage payment behavior (305 kb pdf" (january), paper present "seeds growth - sustainable community development: what works, what doesn’t why?" 5 jeanne m. hogarth marianne a. hilgert (2003), "patterns financial behaviors: implication community educator policymakers (1.7 mb pdf)," paper present "seeds growth - sustainable community development: what works, what doesn’t why?" bi review 54/2006 3 literacy. for example, federal reserve bank cleveland work community financial educator form regional network combine resource share best practices. the federal reserve bank chicago sponsor "moneysmart week," partner banks, businesses, government agencies, schools, community organizations, library host activity design help consumer learn manage money. the federal reserve bank san francisco minneapolis work leader native american community develop financial education materials. my recent testimony congress financial literacy provide information many project programs.6 the federal reserve continue make financial education priority. strategy encourage save even people know would good save budget wisely, know personal experience translate good intention action difficult. (think hard keep new year’s resolutions.) the field behavioral economics, study economic financial decision psychological perspective, cast new light consumer behavior lead recommendation improve people’s financial management. for example, study individual choice 401(k) save plan strongly suggest worker pay adequate attention save investment decisions. notably, despite tax advantage 401(k) contribution and, cases, generous employer match, one-quarter worker eligible 401(k) plan participate. study found, however, firm change presentation plan "opt-in" choice "opt-out" choice, worker automatically enrol unless actively choose remain plan, participation rate increase substantially.7 the impact change "opt-in" "opt-out" particularly evident young lower-income workers, may le financial expertise. in addition, participant save plan evidently understand various investment option offered. a survey investment management firm, the vanguard group, find many plan participant cannot ass risk inherent different type financial assets; example, many appreciate diversify equity mutual fund generally le risky keep one’s wealth form employer’s stock.8 indeed, employee appear invest heavily company’s stock despite fact income already tie fortune employer. more one-quarter 401(k) balance hold company stock, high share arise employer match voluntary purchase well.9these insight consumer behavior prompt change design retirement plan education program focus save retirement. more employer feature automatic enrollment 401(k) plan effort boost participation. also, set default investment option diversify portfolio rebalanced automatically worker age set contribution rate rise automatically time line salary increases. however, although change program design may boost save improve investment choices, substitute continue financial education. employers, include federal reserve board, offer financial education workplace help worker gain good understand retirement save options. help people appreciate importance save give tool need translate knowledge action remain major challenges. 6 chairman ben s. bernanke, financial literacy, testimony before committee banking,

policy lecture mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank, “activism alertness monetary policy,” conference “central bank 21st century” organise bank spain, madrid, 8 june 2006. * * * lady gentlemen, since 1 january 1999, day officially become monetary authority euro area, ecb change policy rate, rate main refinance operations, 18 times. over period, federal reserve system make 35 changes. the ease cycle start side atlantic – channel – 2001 saw cumulative reduction policy rate 275 basis point euro area, accomplish sequence seven moves. the ecb start reverse cycle december last year since change policy sequence three steps. in unite states, ease phase saw 13 reductions, total loosen 550 basis points, first reverse june 2004. since then, federal reserve hike target rate 16 time continuous steps. i think i would take advantage opportunity afford impressive programme revisit theme i reflect past: “activism” monetary policy. be univocal definition notion? can “activism” quantify simple statistic frequency size policy moves? can central bank “active” move policy rate measure observationally cautious way? wa ecb active enough respond evolve state euro area economy? the fact i recount seem suggest otherwise. i try convince contrary true. i offer provisional answer basis i believe i learn thus far. i suspect, though, pass time analysis euro area economy need deepen understand issue. my definition activism monetary policy is, i believe, conventional: activism strategic attitude central bank constantly endeavour faithful objective. in case ecb, constant strive keep inflation close arithmetic objective, take step need check nascent inflationary pressure time try minimise unnecessary macroeconomic disruption process. “activist” attribute apply strategy, policy path. my answer question whether activism measure simple statistic negative. strategic activism monetary policy cannot quantify simple terms, abstraction knowledge key structural force economic relationship govern function system point time. when evaluate appropriateness action, central bank luxury link policy handful summary statistics. they engage complicate process signal extraction wealth diffuse data events. they calibrate decision key structural parameter economy monetary policy function, nature shock economy typically prone. the path policy adjust accordingly. the ecb’s strategy active need fulfil mandate. i would claim clarity objective policy afford considerable latitude action early year decade, remarkable leverage market condition recently. this happen despite repeat unfavourable shock former period apparent policy inaction latter. always, strategy information come real economy, well sphere monetary aggregates, much words, shape market expectation beyond near term, sign complex analysis require predict judgement materially impede market participant respond meaningfully incoming data. bi review 53/2006 1 policy activism economic dynamism to frame issue, let u consider stereotypical monetary policy reaction function short-term interest rate leave number observable reaction variable right. think, example, kind reaction function econometrician expert observer often use – sometimes abuse – compare monetary policy strategies. in essence, encapsulate simple rule thumb: raise policy rate anticipate inflation high objective sign economy operate capacity. an additional condition ensure macroeconomic stability apply rule reaction nominal rate must strong enough real rate vary pro-cyclically: inflation expectation rise, economy expand potential, real monetary condition tightened. i choose way frame issue primarily widely use observers, sufficiently concise easily understood. but, launch analysis, i add that, precisely simple pedagogical, framework also incomplete description policy behaviour. overall, capture essence two-pillar strategy, base economic assessment medium-term risk price stability, one hand, cross-check base medium longer-term risk assess though monetary analysis, other. also, representation policy sufficiently state-contingent, whereas colleague i far exclusively guide mechanical configuration indicators, interest contingencies, finally take decision basis synthetic judgement enlighten multiple experiences. a i often say, collegial wisdom essence central banking. this underscore tension describe policy simply implement policy simply: simple description policy need – indeed never – mean simple policy behaviour. assume parameter attach various indicator variable reaction function indeed capture deep strategic preference central bank, empirical estimate coefficient often use quantify strength central bank intend respond state economy. in words, estimate parameter sometimes view objective measure strategic “activism” monetary policy. a central bank would qualify strategically passive – le active – another central bank estimate coefficient attach inflation expectation deviation central bank’s objective, estimate coefficient penalise indicator macroeconomic slack, turn smaller. why would central bank qualify “passive”? because, give variance inflation real activity, central bank would indeed incline take moderate action response change outlook. it would move policy rate narrow margin – perhaps 2 bi review 53/2006 infrequently – “activist” counterpart. moreover, analyst typically append partial adjustment mechanism representation central bank interest rate respond economic state, additional source “activism” – “passivity” – would emerge simple empirics. this inertia coefficient attach lag interest rate dependent variable, rule moderate pace reaction policy rate fundamental determinants. in case, naive theory world, plain comparison frequency policy move size interest rate adjustment would suffice tell strategy two central bank apart. a smooth policy path would signal “more passive” strategy. but course world simple, fact serious pitfall lurk behind strategic inference draw basis comparison variance policy rates. it difficult portray situation inference could highly misleading. i give three examples, relax one important qualification upon early example predicated: assumption two central bank confront economic environment. first, imagine two central bank equally responsive economic conditions: reaction-rule jargon i use here, two central bank share exactly reaction parameters. but one central bank face le dynamic economy counterpart. by “less dynamic” i mean economy – matter regularity – hit shock small magnitude tend fade away gradually. here, reaction parameter – hypothesis – reaction variable fluctuate different speeds. all thing equal, pattern adjustment policy rate rule would induce two economy would likely look different. the central bank operate le dynamic economy would likelihood observe adjust interest rate along moderate path. the central bank would appear reactive. but strategic implication draw variance two policy path would purely illusionary. the smooth course policy would reveal deep-seated strategic inertia: would reflect response shock quite different dynamic properties. monetary policy would appear “passive” economy evolve slowly.1a second example consider two identical central banks, face shock different nature. one central bank predominantly face demand shocks, result persistent departure trend growth. this statistical pattern symmetric durable effect output inflation thus present relatively straightforward monetary policy problem rule i postulate simplicity. a reaction variable – forecast inflation output – would frequently move tandem, policy rate central bank would change frequently forcefully direction offset shock. but would happen economy, – unlike first – prone supply shocks? experience suggest supply shock yield sharp transitory increase inflation, possibly follow smaller, permanent “second-round” effects, though longer-run impact inflation obviously significantly determine response monetary policy. give transitory nature initial inflation bursts, simple hypothetical rule – incorporate reaction expect inflation – would advise central bank “look through” immediate disturbance change policy extent need offset anticipate permanent effect shock inflation subsequent quarters. it policy rate, again, would observe le variable. what important note rule – equally active strategy – would support two different pattern observe policy behaviour different economic environments. the third case perhaps interest all. here exogenous shock identical, economic structure differ. different transmission mechanism therefore propagate shock lag vary two economies. the first economy rigid adjustment mechanisms: price-setters wage-negotiators sluggish economy process economic news – include change stance monetary policy – bring bear decisions. what source rigidity first economy? there many reason rigidity. perhaps labour practice contractual institution – date early post-war decade economy heavily regulate – induce distortion large 1 a similar interpretation “interest rate inertia” – tendency central bank adjust rate direction small step – find g. rudebusch, “term structure evidence interest rate smooth monetary policy inertia”, journal monetary economics, vol. 49 (pp. 1161-1187), 2002. bi review 53/2006 3 segment labour market. this stand way efficient match skill productive capabilities. perhaps tight regulatory restraint business statutory inhibition discourage innovation impede fast response new shock new opportunities. whatever source rigidity, observational result price wage first economy reflect change fundamental considerable lags. how monetary policy respond shock conditions? note i move away naive world simple policy rule take step – admittedly le conjectural – realm optimal policy design. the answer question depend critically inflation process postulate. we know inflation expectation well-anchored around inflation objective central bank, evolution inflation time influence numerical objective policy history inflation itself. we state differently, say economy internalise central bank’s objective firmly, inflation process become le persistent forward-looking. if inflation expectation well-anchored, shock inflation recent past likely less impact inflation future. one reason shock encourage worker bargain commensurate rise nominal wage protect real value earnings. equally, firm would certainly resist potential bargaining. all party price-setters anticipate central bank ultimately drive inflation back pre-shock level. hence, tend treat past inflationary shock transitory inconsequential future outlook. in first economy example, price sticky inflation expectation well-anchored, monetary policy patient focus medium term confront cost-push shock. again, two examples, likely observe change policy le aggressively face unexpected shock headline inflation. but seem “patience”, again, signal inertia, “passivity” neglect macroeconomic conditions. it reflect careful calibration policy course structural peculiarity underlie economy. first foremost, policy response inflationary shock le persistent inflationary consequence shock promptly reabsorb first place. second, stickier prices, change nominal policy rate give size strong impact real rate, matter come measure stance policy. in conditions, moderate policy path cause instability. in fact, precondition avoid danger over-steering, accidentally destabilise economy. of course, think experiment i share far useful rule optimality benchmark real-world behaviour compared. and i certainly one belief simple reaction rule – monetary policy optimality exercises, matter – cannot serve ultimate test actual policy behaviour. but i hope i convey one notion. even over-simplified world canonical examples, macroeconomic state adequately describe handful facts, fact reliably condense summary indicator – which, too, immune sample error statistical revisions2 – policy algorithm acceptable description policy choices, even conjectural world variability policy instrument would sufficient statistic judge monetary policy strategies. in particular, even world, slower-moving, structurally rigid economy would support observationally moderate policy course. in real world, i try explain next, observationally moderate path policy receive even strong justification. fact policy euro area my emphasis structurally rigid le dynamic economy periodically face adverse supply shock is, course, deliberate. that laboratory case resemble euro area i know. i organise interpretation stylise fact euro area recent past three broad categories: shocks, structure monetary policy. 2 of course, actual practice monetary policy, uncertainty data extremely pervasive. we even uncertain current economic situation economic data receive lag, typically subject multiple revisions, case roughly partially depict underlie economic reality. 4 bi review 53/2006 shock one reason euro area resemble third example that, compare unite states, seem subject demand shock small magnitude frequently hit supply shocks.3 in last ten year shock pattern seem grow even pronounced, despite globalisation generalise shift towards close international economic integration.4 this nowhere evident anatomy boom-bust cycle span decade start 1995 two economies. in unite states, run-up phase significantly propel – know hindsight – overly optimistic view long-run earn growth and, notably, exaggerate belief profitability emerge technologies. but strength business

u take ease decision without run risk destabilise inflation expectations. that conviction reinforce rapidly deteriorate outlook reassure sign inflation expectation discount scenario inflation would

inflation considerably weaker. information extract monetary trend support prediction subdue inflation look distant future. monetary accommodation quick and, retrospect, far persistent could predict basis policy regularity record. in end, monetary action amount interest rate reduction 275 basis points, bring policy rate level low intervention rate central bank overwhelm majority member countries,

analysis mix macroeconomic shock hit euro area since 2001 reveal hindsight extra monetary policy stimulus introduce critical avoid deep endure recession global scale. i judge policy course carefully

inflation output would necessitate corrective, countervail action road.12 certainly, i argue shortly, ecb would maintain nominal real policy rate low level hold two year without consistent sign

this analysis reach two conclusions. first, loss gdp would associate situation ecb deviate estimate reaction rule embed model – thus monetary policy euro area follow tight course – would come close 1%

i may twist phrase borrow alan blind ricardo real – cannot resurrected.14 build maintain reputation prudent policy involve commitment systematic strategy: is, follow recurrent pattern behaviour, stable expectation consistently validate ex post. during extend period policy accommodation, able steer expectation effectively without explicit action, proof market accept true ultimate motif policy profess. in instance expectation display sign overreaction current event – surge oil price – renew emphasis communication objective, vigilance determination would apply enforce it, steady alertness, provide effective resistance inordinate developments. importantly, signal vigilance prove instrumental reach common understand markets: ecb, though observationally inactive, time ready start action. our policy course rightly see always contingent arrival new information. give information available time govern council meets, stand assumption market always policy decision aim position stance policy appropriately. no history past monetary policy decision could ever take indication commitment, side, enact sequence interest rate move future. unconditional – “quasi-unconditional” – talk future policy would impair difficult balance maintain supportive credit condition persistently anchor inflation expectations. active emphasis communication upon “alertness” require keep option open – possibly quick – change policy. pre-commitment policy path would certainly make reversal policy difficult execute and/or justify, therefore non-credible. the market seem internalise strategic principle increase degree precision. incoming data which, since autumn 2005, indicate persuasive sign recovery environment abundant liquidity elevate commodity price correctly map expectation stance prevail would consistent control inflation medium term. market anticipate good time ecb would soon begin reverse extra ease put place. in retrospect, market expectation align well intentions. since

11 durmuş yilmaz: central bank emerge economy – turkish experience speech mr durmuş yilmaz, governor central bank republic turkey, “international conference economics”, ankara, 12 september 2006. * * * dear professors, colleagues, guests, i please participate conference cover broad range economic issue attend many distinguish academician different countries. it also great pleasure deliver speech topic central bank emerge economy turkish experience. dear guests, give wide range issue relate central bank emerge economy limit time available, i decide limit extent remark today. i’d like talk challenge face today’s central banker emerge market countries, mainly context turkish experience. however, embark subject, let first step back take look evolution central banking, especially recent past. there doubt throughout 20th century, central bank undergo tremendous transformation numerical term institutional aspects. at begin last century, example, 15 central bank world. in fact, important figure central bank first establish mainly lender last resort banknote issuer, rather institutional body monetary policy. today, 160 central bank operate around world. some also responsible supervision regulation financial system publish financial stability reports, target certain measure general price level issue inflation reports. thus, broad perspective, evolution central bank follow course maintain liquidity necessary issue banknotes, towards keep inflation low stable, preserve stability financial markets. in sense, evolution process characterize converge objective function central bank around world. to precise, generally accept case industrialize nation emerge economies, main contribution central bank make economic welfare long run achieve maintain price stability. moreover, maintain price stability merely issue maximization economic welfare. it give people confidence money retain value time, ensure price signal function guide market function efficiently establish trust interaction among economic agents, property rights, society future general1. under framework, central bank today operate mainly override objective price stability either explicitly implicitly. dear guests, the establishment single mandate price stability also significant implication institutional design central banks. in fact, clearly see especially emerge market countries, price stability achieve long term determine policy implementations. it point independence, assurance give public ensure long-term price stability, come forefront crucial feature institutional design central banks. in view, change face central bank last two decades, important one increase emphasis place central bank independence. 1 issing, o. (2000). “should we have faith central banks?”. bi review 88/2006 1 while inflation fall independence become important feature central bank around world, turkey unable experience process. it 2001 central bank turkey gain independence close global standards. in 2001, amendment make law, achieve maintain price stability state primary objective, central bank turkey provide direct authority set monetary policy choose instrument discretion achieve price stability. i believe one major structural reform turkish economy, especially term effect inflation. of course, independence concept achieve via implementation law alone. it concept policy practice great influence upon. dear participants, have mention two milestone notion central banking, i’d like continue challenge central bank emerge economy combine turkish experience term monetary policy implementations. although objective function similar financially liberalize well-functioning market economies, transmission monetary policy action economy certainly differ industrialize country emerge market economies. accordingly, wide range view among economist monetary policy decision influence economies. if add uncertainty face internal dynamic emerge market economy picture, impact decision take central bank might differ one country another term nature time even one period time another country. first, important note design implementation monetary policy, understand structural change essential since impact monetary policy decision give economy depend structural change macroeconomic environment2. on hand, clear emerge economy like turkey subject structural change frequently develop economy. combine two facts, central banker emerge economy face challenge model economy properly react accordingly. in addition, i believe exaggeration say subsequent crisis reform process largely define economic landscape emerge market economy last twenty years. thus, uncertainty, naturally exist every economy, constitute real challenge central banker many emerge economy volatile unpredictable structure. dear guests, what experience turkish economy last five year classify one clear example impact structural change economy. first all, thirty-year period high chronic inflation, inflation decline 68.5 percent 2001 10.26 percent august 2006. this decline inflation also make possible perform currency reform begin 2005 drop six zero currency. second, experience high growth rate inflation falling. i say turkish economy leave behind boom-bust cycle growth grow last eighteen quarter consecutively. additionally, source growth changed, well. third, decline trend ratio public debt national income contribute fight inflation relative stability financial markets. all development decisive implementation policy reflect reduce uncertainty increase predictability, strengthen macroeconomic fundamentals, increase resilience shock change dynamic economy bring private sector forefront; rise productivity, change behavior increase competition. all all, clear turkish economy undergo structural transformation since 2001. after go deep structural transformation, safe say turkish economy gradually normalized. accord studies, impact decision short-term interest 2 bis. (1998). “the transmission monetary policy emerge market economies”. bi policy paper no. 3. 2 bi review 88/2006 rate inflation economy observe 18 9 month respectively turkey. we also calculate lag lengthen progress structural transformation. dear participants, the second challenge central bank emerge economy dollarization. in fact, issue dollarization become common characteristic many emerge market like turkey since begin 1990s. both experience latin american economy clearly indicate dollarization increase fragility almost every sector economy, namely real sector, public sector financial sector. from perspective real sector, dollarization appear several respects. first, affect price behaviors. in words, high level dollarization likely cause high pass-through effect exchange rate inflation. besides, country derivative market well developed, balance sheet effect exchange rate fluctuation private sector also important implication consider level exposure exchange rate risk. from perspective public sector, currency mismatch problem arises, give great part government revenue denominate national currency, part liability denominate foreign currencies. regard financial sector, observe similar effects. with negative impact balance sheet financial intermediaries, dollarization raise possibility default risk liquidity risk sector, distort effective credit allocation available resources. all fragility cause dollarization heavily affect way central bank implement policy weaken impact monetary policy decisions. besides, dollarization emerge economy threaten central bank cause instability uncertainty money demand, turn make hard predict money supply control inflation. dear guests, when look turkish case, see dollarization root macroeconomic instability, inefficient market regulation lack credibility economic policy one hand; predictable exchange rate hand. the high chronic inflation period lead economic agent invest simply foreign currency, easy least costly method risk aversion. in addition, market regulation blanket guarantee foreign exchange deposit lack supervision support process dollarization, well. a 2001, turkey one dollarized emerge market economy share 58.2 percent foreign exchange deposit total deposits. the ratio 49.3 percent romania, 46.8 percent russia 47 percent peru, generally accept highly dollarized economies. today, look ahead year 2001 experience reverse dollarization last four years. a august 2006, ratio foreign exchange deposit total deposit decrease 36.7 percent. similarly, ratio investment instrument denominate domestic currency pursue increase trend, foreign currency decrease accordingly. i say long float exchange rate regime implement properly inflation keep control credible macroeconomic policies, float exchange rate regime along inflation-targeting regime crucial role decrease level dollarization. however, i would like add level dollarization decline fast, still high. although diminish extent, still observe linger behavior inherit past inflation period. that important continue current policy structural reforms. dear participants, the third factor stand challenge central bank sustainability fiscal discipline emerge economies. bi review 88/2006 3 it challenge impact inflation aggregate demand, also financial stability since concern sustainability fiscal policy likely influence economic variable interest rates, exchange rates, measure risk premium. in context, differ many emerge market role fiscal dominance, situation fiscal policy ultimately govern price determination financial markets3, crowd available sources, disrupt effective credit allocation economy, impair effect monetary policy aggregate demand. the high level fiscal dominance many emerge market country associate high level public sector borrow requirements. additionally, vulnerability public sectors’ balance sheet debt structure may constitute barrier central banks’ policy decision short-term interest rate hikes. such fiscal distortion rare industrialize economy hence, economy le susceptible adverse shock come fiscal side. dear guests, in addition issue i mentioned, opinion two issue relate fiscal policy public debt management cause challenge many emerge market economy like turkey. the first one relatively short maturity debt compare develop country “original sin” problem, present literature eichengreen haussmann.4 in context, emerge country force borrow unit currency basically unable issue. all concern direct impact fragility financial markets. therefore, doubt sustainability fiscal discipline cause volatility financial variable high possibility endanger central bank goals. in case turkey, look back, see period high variable inflation coincide high public deficit finance central bank. an increase lack fiscal discipline public expenditure widen budget deficit cause inflation get control public sector borrow requirement grow continuously. this structure affect bank system, well. the turkish bank sector able perform intermediary function effectively. instead, sector mostly finance public sector deficits. look present, hand, one important change central bank turkey long extend credit treasury public institution amendment make law 2001. and coincidence inflation decline trend since then. moreover, tight fiscal policy put practice last five years. a high level primary surplus, 6.5 percent, targeted. the positive effect measure start observe several areas. the ratio consolidate budget deficit gross national product turn surplus 0.4 percent second quarter 2006. and ratio public sector net debt stock gross national product decrease 90.5 percent 2001 52.8 percent first quarter 2006. in fact, public sector net debt stock downward path converge towards maastricht criterion. and maturity become longer. more importantly, issue public debt sustainability long top agenda, imply decrease pressure financial markets. i want stress continuation tight fiscal policy high primary surplus quite important term price stability objective financial stability issue. dear participants, the last concept central bank i want mention today role expectation management emerge market economies. 3 moreno, r. (2002). “fiscal issue central bank emerge economies: an overview”. meet hold bi december 2002. 4 eichengreen, b., haussmann, r. (1999). “exchange rate financial fragility”. nber work paper 7418. 4 bi review 88/2006 a economic literature tell us, well know, management expectation great importance every central banker. quote michael woodford5, “for successful monetary policy much matter effective control overnight interest rate shape market expectation way interest rates, inflation, income likely evolve come year later”. i believe expectation form bridge short-term interest rate long-term interest rates. the expectation converge targets, great likelihood success policies. also, le volatile expectation are, stable predictable effect monetary policy economy is. however, come emerge market economies, function expectation differ develop countries. to precise, expectation affect economy heavily channel many emerge market country high inflationary past6. we central bank turkey also familiar experience. the impact short-term interest rate decision observe within much short period time expectation channel, make channel effective one turkey far. in context, i find particularly critical experience high inflationary history emerge market country stand real challenge expectation management several respects. one reason lack credibility result high chronic inflation period emerge economies. since period characterize monetization public debt source central bank central bank objective sometimes even contradict price stability, economic agent tend doubt credibility central bank policies. not mention constitute limit effectiveness monetary policies. the one know “inflationary psychology” “inflation scare”. to precise, high volatile inflationary periods, economic agent emerge economy incline exaggerate adverse effect economy price stability. thus, seasonal rise inflation may immediately lead deterioration inflation expectation high price little transitional impact level economic activity. at point, give importance expectation management, key aspect policy framework transparency communication. here, impossible agree paul volcker, said; “i one lesson indelible brain: don’t let inflation get ingrained. once happens, there’s much agony stop momentum.”7referring turkish case, i say thirty-year experience high chronic inflation make u face challenge convince public financial market commit bring inflation maintain price stability. in every platform participate every announcement made, emphasize policy objective, achieve maintain price stability, reason underlie policy implementation importance medium-term vision term lag effect policy decisions. to end, try use communication policy effectively important part inflation-targeting regime. we base communication policy grind trust, transparency, consistency decisiveness. i believe peculiar turkish case. many central banker emerge market country deal drawback past high chronic inflation thus incredible policies. and mean clear design communication strategy easy circumstances. a may agree, concept communication dynamic issue. therefore, give importance effective communication, important note central bank turkey work continuously improve communication policy. 5 woodford, m.

challenge area large scale technological upgradation. at top pyramid challenge choice right technological solution. most often not, guide vendor presentation experience organisation process selection end get system may necessarily best one bank concerned. while broad technological contour may same, customisation may hold key provide correct system individual organisation. i remind case bank start instal cash dispense machine year ago, base experience west. today, observe automate teller machine (atms) multi-functional regional language capability construe optimal fit cash base relate

signature, holder share card unauthorised person. thus, entire chain procedure component system look holistic manner ensure security pervasive across entire chain activities. another important challenge face u need standardisation. while standardisation mean uniform system use across banks, bare minimum requirement ensure inter-operability provide for. with margin across different partner business thinning, essential bank take straight through process inter-operability key issue address technological implementations. the usage sfms idrbt, hoped, address concern large extent. this also challenge i sure idrbt also take right earnest benefit financial sector whole. the growth mobile communication exponential usage mobile telephony india’s mass aspect view, bank look upon opportunity harness benefit. the power chip mobile phone enormous usage secure bank transaction need examine provide for. i would also like touch another challenge bank slowly overcoming. the need regular, sustain be audit highlight reserve bank time now. while initiative take bank towards achieve this, much need done. the speed it implementation upgradation do may outpace frequency be audit best

alternatively important train stake holder ensure smooth technological transformation. many must occasion read book ‘freakonomics’ steven levitt stephen dubner. the narrative lifetime episode paul

educate consumers, turn, benefit economy encourage genuine competition, force service provider innovate improve level efficiency. global practice it said, particularly context develop economy young save enough fully understand need investment future, many elderly tend feel pinch poverty. in background, priority need accord financial education. for example, uk, financial service authority launch big ever campaign improve financial skill population impart education enable good appreciation risk reward inherent financial instruments. the u treasury establish office financial education 2002. the office work promote access financial education tool help u citizen make wise choice area personal financial management, special emphasis saving, credit management, home ownership retirement planning. the financial literacy education commission (flec), establish congress 2003 passage financial literacy education improvement act, create purpose improve financial literacy education person unite state development national strategy promote financial literacy education. the federal reserve, along numerous federal government agencies, member commission, support office financial education. the federal

pro-active initiative generate awareness financial education. it recently release major international study financial education title 'improving financial literacy' encompass practical guideline good practice financial education awareness. these guidelines, form non-binding recommendation, design help country devise implement effective financial education programmes, draw best practice area oecd countries. they promote role main stakeholder financial education: governments, financial institutions, employers, trade union consumer groups. 2 bi review 87/2006 in addition, also draw clear distinction public information provide government regulatory authorities, supply financial analysts. it also important devise way ascertain whether financial education achieve objective, generate increase consumer awareness change behaviour, point i return little later. the balance evidence, however, suggest programme tend effective. for instance, unite states, observe worker increase participation retirement save plan fund employee employer contribution latter offer financial education programmes, whether form brochure seminars. consumer attend one-on-one counsel session personal finance few delinquencies. indian reality prior initiation financial sector reform early 1990s, indian financial system essentially cater need plan development. customer little choice financial instruments. the segment underdevelop financial market mean exposure risk also limited. in situation, customer could employ basic skill invest simple financial product assure returns, unconcerned risks. the relevance financial education was, best, limited. pursuant process globalisation, economic financial landscape india undergo significant transformation. in process, economy become diversify new source growth. in tandem changes, see modernisation financial sector also become increasingly diversify meet new requirement economy. the financial sector also increasingly leverage advance technology significantly change way financial business conducted. a market advance continue expand range financial product services, consumer face increasingly multifaceted choice option management

multiply opportunity consume, save, invest. have basic financial plan skill help family meet near-term obligation maximise longer-term financial well-being. financial education also integral component customer protection. despite concert efforts, current state transparency couple difficulty consumer identify understand fine print large volume convolute information, lead information asymmetry financial intermediary customer. for example, customer often penalise minor violation repayments, although limit redressal mechanism rectify deficiency service banks, render banker-customer relationship one unequals. in relationship, principal, is, depositor, actually far le powerful agent, is, bank. the representation receive regard levy unreasonably high service user charge enhancement user charge without proper prior intimation, grow number customer complaint banks, also testify fact. in context, bi review 87/2006 3 financial education may help prevent vulnerable consumer fall prey financially disquiet credit arrangements. there however, issue would need address upfront indian context. first, regional profile country diversified, people across different region typically conversant vernacular languages. second, exist wide divergence literacy level across states. thus, instance, several state union territories, literacy rate 2001 well national average 65.4 per cent; contrast, also region literacy level remain perennially low. third, dependency ratio vary markedly across states. fourth, within state, mark difference rural urban areas. fifth, also perceptible variation penetration bank across regions. take together, unique condition country create role public policy devise enable mechanism improve level financial education, reckon regional differences. to extent common person good able understand appreciate need financial education, task financial regulator greatly simplified, low overall cost regulation. possible approach it imperative increase globalisation difference pace growth financial sector financial education minimized. there several way go process. for purpose illustration, classify institutional mechanisms, delivery mechanism decentralisation efforts. institutional mechanism a regard institutional mechanism, near consensus fact attempt expand outreach financial education need start grass-roots. present day school pass-outs need lot financially literate parent were, manage personal finance successfully life. in addition, university business school important role train financial specialist able provide public high quality advice financial matters. yet another channel impart financial education could workplace reach work adults. it would, therefore, potent mechanism provide information number financial service retirement scheme insurance. the role financial institution provide financial education, client also staff, need good define promoted. more information need international national level good programme practice way promote access financial service harness role non-government organisation (ngos). international organisation well-positioned coordinate international survey study various aspect financial education, evaluate comparative efficiency various financial education programmes, develop guideline good practice policymakers implementation. international agency also provide forum country compare discus strategy educate consumer financial issues. several government central banks, either directly indirectly, actively involve provision financial education consumer credit, investment, financial issues, often part public policy campaign improve protection individual borrower investors, instance, part ongoing pension reform efforts. exchange experience amongst central bank would thus productive. delivery mechanism the delivery mechanism impart financial education manifold. however, content delivery financial education correspond need specific sub-groups consumer is, young elderly, le good educated, well- ill-informed. presentations, lectures, conferences, symposia, train course seminar actively utilise purpose. second, publication diverse forms, include books, brochures, magazines, booklets/pamphlets, direct mail documents, also useful regard. 4 bi review 87/2006 third, leverage information technology concert medium campaign use possible avenue mass communication expect impart great efficacy process. other method include advisory service institutions, include fast grow telecommunication services. not supply financial education, also demand important. most delivery channel good already interest particular topics. an important challenge create demand financial information education. decentralisation effort give unique condition country, attempt expand outreach financial education take cognisance role regional difference language, workforce penetration finance. thus, bank strong presence across different region could explore possibility introduce local-language base web-site provide detail facility customers. second, recent times, explosion internet alter relationship financial organisation clientele. organisation examine way good communicate prospective exist client enrich information content website line practice mature markets. third, credit counsel potent tool financial entity expand reach financial education. fourth, might interest

globalisation simply understand way world become small ‘village’ ‘community’ result fast transport, communication technological advancement turn result reduction cost international trade, investment

innovative policy practice credit supplementation institution asian region one major challenge foster growth sustainability, particularly develop economies, design implementation appropriate policy develop small medium enterprises. in economy sound policy place, problem may due failure government seriously ensure policy implemented. a small medium enterprise develop economy comparative advantage compare large establish companies, attempt capture niche markets, domestic well international, would difficult unless appropriate government policy place effectively implement provide relief, particularly ‘infant’ stage growth cycle. observation economies, include japan, china republic korea show country do well governments’ policy focus encourage small medium enterprise contribute towards economic growth. these experience worth note studying. regulation small medium enterprise small medium enterprise country specific legal framework regulate activity government share view much regulation unnecessary interference may impact negatively normal commercial operations. however, small medium enterprise expect abide relevant law regulations, include taxation law. this subject contention therefore i would rather leave exchange view it. finance small medium enterprise credit guarantee scheme amidst constraint face small medium enterprises, lack finance access finance appear one main drawback growth competitiveness. this global problem, see asia-pacific region well. in country region, initiative create avenue small medium enterprise obtain credit without excessive scrutiny discrimination financier credit providers. this do back government enable establishment financial institution accommodate target small medium enterprises. in economy supply credit limited,

express important role small medium enterprise contributor long-term sustainable development private sector economic growth country. like countries, small medium enterprise papua new guinea regulated, however, require operate compliance relevant law country include taxation requirements. in order small medium enterprise successful, adequate government support agency task function need enhanced. this would ensure small & medium enterprise develop beyond infant stage reach self-sustainable levels. finance there relatively limit credit supplementation institution financial institution will provide credit small medium enterprise country. the problem even hard government-funded credit supplementation institution like rural development bank meet credit need limit annual budget

credit guarantee facility scheme credit guarantee scheme seem limit success papua new guinea’s situation, perhaps partly scheme fully appreciate understood. the problem also extend include government

various problem include lengthy stringent process access credit, facility fully utilise european investment bank withdraw scheme 1998. conclusion to conclude, remind accelerate pace world change present many challenge small medium enterprise asia-pacific region. small medium enterprise region, well part world, similar feature confront similar problem lack of: • finance; • entrepreneurial/managerial skills; • access appropriate technology information systems; • appropriate policy guidelines. a practitioners, doubt good place share view experience solve problem deny

windfall revenue”, arrange part seminar program 2006 annual meet imf world bank, singapore, 18 september 2006. please note text may differ slightly actual presentation. * * * 1. thank opportunity discus challenge arise manage financial wealth public sector environment. norge bank eight ten year experience task, i shall try describe brief strategy adopt norge bank, believe learned. 2. we large amount money management. our foreign reserve probably large need financial stability monetary policy operations. but important fund government pension fund, formerly petroleum fund. we responsible manage fund since inception 1996, major task u since 1998. 3. the value petroleum resource north sea currently estimate usd 700 billion. the government receive bulk revenue generate petroleum extraction sale revenue taxes. the government channel revenue pension fund financial assets. annual spend fund subject spend rule, whereby government commit limit spending. over time spend exceed estimate expect real return fund’s investments, set 4 per cent per year. this imply fund expect become permanent save account. 4. at outset, already investment management operation bank, foreign reserves. but become clear 1997 pension fund would grow fast, decide set separate management unit, call norge bank investment management (nbim). our challenge build business organisation within traditional civil service culture. the new unit recruit investment professional outside bank well people exist reserve management operations. nbim explicitly define business unit, different rest central bank many respects. to avoid suspicion nbim would benefit proprietary central bank information, new unit place completely outside decision-making process monetary policy financial stability area, access confidential information. the fact pension fund invest norwegian market also important avoid conflict interest: there direct link monetary policy operations. 5. the purpose pension fund foreign reserve similar; essentially national save funds, except part reserve may need policy purposes. the current asset allocation thus effectively funds. at present 40 per cent equity 60 per cent fix income. the investment widely diversify across international markets. the investment strategy far aim low return volatility, perhaps large extent reasonable fund mean permanent. the strategy currently review ministry finance, may change way. 6. the ministry finance act owner pension fund, behalf government. the management pension fund delegate norge bank. the key feature model bi review 86/2006 1 division responsibility two institutions. the ministry take high-level decision define clear mandate norge bank. in accordance mandate norge bank make investment decision without interference ministry. the benchmark portfolio fund define ministry. the benchmark determine asset allocation actual portfolio, ministry also leaf leeway manager. nbim shall deviate benchmark order obtain high return. active management become important part investment operations. we believe search excess return strong disciplinary effect organisation view control market operational risk, ensure inside outside supplier exactly pay do. 7. we try build organisation focus investment returns. in order keep focus try implement three basic principles: • accountability decision clearly define • there transparency, nothing hide away • the professional standard require employee high 8. for investment decision principle mean every decision make one individual remuneration pay depend profitability decisions. we define large number independent profit centers, clearly define mandate. a compliance function check one operate outside mandate. for external manager apply principle: hire external manager investment decision, someone inside nbim hold responsible it. 9. the salary system different rest central bank. the main objective focus attention performance, give distinct signal people perform accord expectations. salary two components, basic salary performance-based component. the latter important part total salary, imply difference salary poor outstanding performer large. the level salary benchmarked private sector competitor local market operate. the criterion use design transparent little room subjective judgement. measure excess return contribution important component. 10. i believe experience far positive. since fund’s first full year 1997, annual return international currency 6 per cent nominal term 4.1 per cent real terms. since nbim set 1998, record performance 34 quarters. in 9 quarter return fund low benchmark, 25 34 positive excess return. on average, nbim earn exactly half percentage point high return per year benchmark portfolio. in nominal terms, add somewhere usd 4 5 billion extra earn since 1998. 11. in introduction i touch i believe important factor behind performance nbim. it important keep mind purpose investment management operation make money, need business organisation. the responsibility individual must clearly defined, remuneration must depend performance. the incentive must set way lead individual chase correct targets, way reward superior performance. this description traditional central bank culture, investment management unit may need build outside exist structures. at time exist structure may benefit 2

michael spence. so today's topic "sharing some perspective growth" fit like glove. in offer perspectives, i shall draw heavily experience singapore. forty year ago, soon i start work economic plan unit finance ministry, i send post-graduate course development economics williams college us. the course design young official develop countries. there 20 u 16 country span four continent - asia, europe, africa latin america. the country include philippines, pakistan, india, yugoslavia, egypt, tanzania, liberia, honduras, colombia mexico 1the 1960s dub "decade promise". an unprecedented number colony gain independence. my fellow student i teach late development theories. bright-eyed bushy-tailed, full hope. but 40 year later, history tell different story. only hope fulfilled; dream dashed. yugoslavia, mexico egypt advantage close critical export market develop world. honduras tanzania precious metal deposits, several latin american african countries. singapore nothing, over-populated high unemployment. many economist day predict country latin america africa would outgrow over-populated, resource-scarce asia. the outcome, however, totally different. live standard barely rise honduras last 40 years, decline tanzania. tito's yugoslavia long exists. east pakistan fight war west pakistan separate become bangladesh. civil war internal disorder tear country like liberia, ethiopia uganda. singapore write pundit viable without malaysian hinterland survive thrived. it gdp per caput increase six-fold, good 15 country represent class. why growth experience individual country disparate? some might watch movie, "the good, bad, ugly", released, coincidentally, exactly 40 year ago. set american civil war, three bandit hold one clue hide trove gold coins. they trust other, want money themselves. in end, "good" bandit put three clue together won. discover secret economic growth sense like look clue hide treasure. we may hold clue easy piece together achieve resilient growth. the title movie also apt, i think, categorise growth experience 16 country williams class. malaysia, represent class, enjoy steady economic expansion around 4% 5% real gdp per caput since mid-1960s. it obviously fall "good" category. i put india category primarily advance past 10 years. others like egypt, pakistan honduras stagnated. i would term performance "bad". for efforts, per caput gdp go much. but least good others like bolivia tanzania regressed, poor 1966. their record "ugly". why country travel divergent "good, bad ugly" growth path aspire goal good life? in past, economic theory focus importance 1 the williams college 16 were: singapore, malaysia, india, pakistan, philippine asia; egypt, ethiopia, kenya, liberia, tanzania, uganda africa; bolivia, colombia, honduras, mexico latin america; yugoslavia europe. bi review 86/2006 1 factor inputs, productivity technology. of late, however, academic start recognise critical leadership, politics, good governance institution growth. i believe trigger sustain economic growth, three necessary condition required: • first, vision ideas; • second, sense reality; • third, good implementation a first second factor related, i discus together. vision idea sense reality first, vision ideas. by this, i mean leader must offer political economic vision excite imagination people. they must offer hope programme rally people sacrifice, struggle work together achieve good future. second, sense reality, i mean leader must foot firmly plant grind even imagination growth prosperity soars. in pursue growth, sound basic economic principle prudent fiscal policies, monetary discipline, high save must practised. many countries' experience reinforce importance stable macroeconomic environment benefit market-based system. policy growth must apply local context practical way, take account economy's resource constraints. in addition, country must open new idea prepare change. they must trap old paradigm must constantly adapt ever-changing world. let illustrate singapore's example. after independence, implement policy promote macroeconomic stability. we adopt prudent fiscal policies, direct monetary policy achieve medium-term price stability. our mnc-led growth strategy work well others pursue strategy. so next phase development, also build second platform base entrepreneurship, innovation knowledge. new area focus include research development, biomedical science creative industry. a competition intensifies, break old mould think reinvent way things. for example, overturn longstanding policy disallow casino singapore. to remake singapore city buzz, develop integrate resorts, convention facilities, world-class entertainment casinos. and crazy horse, famed paris cabaret, perform strait-laced singapore. implementation key the third critical aspect growth implementation. right policy guarantee success, capacity implement missing. good implementation found three key pillars: effective leadership, sound institution social cohesion. first, leader responsible devise implement pro-growth policies. they must unify vision foster economic growth, political overcome resistance implement reforms, ability mobilise people engender social consensus. leader must also character, compassion, conviction, commitment persuasive power. above all, must enjoy trust people. the second pillar effective implementation sound institutions. effective leadership must support sound institution like legislature, judiciary, civil service, central bank responsible media. good institution help accumulate experience, knowledge, expertise resource build capacity, thereby sustain growth. poor institutions, hand, could exploit power benefit. corruption easily shave country's potential growth rate percentage points. i emphasise good institution presume argue particular political system. what important political system must work country base history, cultural context, national condition support people. 2 bi review 86/2006 the third pillar effective implementation ensure social cohesion forge social consensus. a policy impact people directly, important social consensus trust - government society, different ethnic social groups. this achieve people give equal opportunity learn work, progress accord merit reward base performance contribution. the government able must also help le able, one leave behind. sustain growth often require trade short-term pain long-term gain. even best policy undermine people unite behind leaders. when social cohesion, different group country look beyond immediate difference co-operate achieve share vision. when three - effective leaders, sound institution social consensus - put together, clue treasure trove economic growth. when country lack three components, cannot discover treasure. in country politics divisive politician play one group another, investor commit large scale long-term investments. without investor confidence, country's capacity grow severely limited. for successful policy implementation, often pay start cautiously reform leverage "demonstration effects". take many small gradual step right direction often work good "big bang" reforms. it allow u review whether idea work make adjustment ensure implementation succeeds. when deng xiaoping open china's door outside world 1978, take approach "crossing river feel stone underfoot". he experiment four special economic zone (sezs) (shenzhen, zhuhai shantou guangdong, xiamen fujian) spearhead reforms. only saw success understand clearly challenge impact liberalisation policy open china further. deng's pragmatic step-by-step approach enable china grow steadily without political social upheaval. in contrast, gorbachev choose reform soviet union big bang glasnost perestroika time. the soviet empire collapse loud bang. back future: next four decade arm know, spot new growth winner next four decades? there many country outside asia potential "good". but i focus asia i familiar development here. i add pick winner growth game tricky business tend rely past experience foreseeable trends. we cannot foresee unexpected, seismic events. i emboldened, however, i would around answer prediction 40 years' time! the china growth story well-known. the chinese jumbo jet take time almost reach cruise altitude. the pilot crew full control, cop pocket turbulence ensure smooth flight. in east asia, japan, south korea, malaysia thailand expect continue well. besides them, i think three country deserve attention leader pragmatic vision country, institution strengthen grow social consensus direction reform. they india, vietnam, indonesia. india india late-comer economic reforms. the indian jumbo jet take runway start climb. it attain cruise altitude. it destination still far away plane may descend time time refuel. but plane, well built, continue long-haul journey, flight path unchanged. there consensus amongst leader major political party direction india's economic reforms. whichever party power deliver economic goods, indian people deserve demand. in june last year, india conclude first comprehensive free trade agreement (fta) singapore. this strong signal india intend leverage external economy open bi review 86/2006 3 further. the fta also act build block india's comprehensive economic integration southeast asia asean-india fta. of course, india face serious challenge like inadequate infrastructure rigid labour market. india must also find way make bureaucracy pro-business, especially towards foreign companies. in addition, india's growth last 10 year drive it service industry. but india cannot grow major economy service alone. it expand manufacture sector massively. vietnam next, vietnam grow strongly past decade. in 1980s, paradigm shift leadership's thinking. vietnam implement economic renovation, doi moi, effort bear fruit. intel build chip plant ho chi minh city. singapore, taiwanese korean firm among big foreign investor country. the new generation vietnamese leadership press reform. however, witness collapse soviet union revolution various colour communist countries, will, like elders, extra careful feel stone cross river. they look singapore one stone river crossing. in 2004, i propose then-prime minister phan van khai singapore vietnam connect economies. he take sometime think respond positively. our two country since sign connectivity agreement, enable vietnam leverage singapore's strength sector like finance, tourism, aviation, telecommunication human resource development. singapore base mncs well-connected part world trade, communication transportation. by connect economies, vietnam plug global grid. indonesia now, indonesia. it potential take work need do - policies, institution implementation. indonesia enjoy strong growth three decades, 1970s mid-1990s. unfortunately, asian financial crisis 1997 ground indonesian plane. but engine overhaul plane refitted. bank firm clean balance sheets. macroeconomic indicator improved. president susilo bambang yudhoyono gather competent crew him. the indonesian plane runway line take-off. president yudhoyono implement difficult much-needed reforms. he cut fuel subsidies, carry unpopular decision raise fuel price keep indonesia's budget deficit ballooning. acceptance need continue economic reform population build investor confidence. investor remain concern unclear inconsistent regulation well security situation threat terrorism. they also unhappy restrictive labour law country. if area improved, foreign investment stream in. indonesia huge sprawl archipelagic country consist almost 18,000 islands, make difficult concert take-off one single planeload. so may good strategy think term build fleet small jets. each one take ready. eventually, entire fleet take whole country airborne. in words, may practical focus first part huge country. these part demonstrate region need attract investor generate growth. they also generate resource help part grow. indonesia decide use strategy sezs spearhead growth. singapore work indonesia develop sezs nearby island batam, bintan karimun. when sezs island succeed, provide thrust momentum sezs part country likewise. 4 bi review 86/2006 conclusion let conclude. the subject growth development complex fascinating. there "one-size-fits-all" magic formula. but country must necessary condition effective political leadership, sound institution social consensus reforms, share fruits. a country must also capacity adapt world changes; otherwise, soon fall behind. i hope stay singapore next day fruitful, enjoyable memorable. thank visit us. bi review 86/2006 5 glenn stevens: capital flow monetary policy remark mr glenn stevens, deputy governor reserve bank australia, “investor insights: anz asia pacific 2006” seminar, singapore, 17 september 2006. i thank guy debelle michael plumb considerable contribution historical part paper. * * * the organiser today’s seminar suggest topic capital flow monetary policy. it seem appropriate one east asian setting. it common hear difficulty create conduct domestic macroeconomic policy capital mobility. the fact capital flow day large, rapid, tend add perception policy complexity. this grow wake asian financial crisis late 1990s, though capital flow cause serious problem country latin america europe numerous occasion long asian crisis occurred. various country asia still wary international capital flows, even accumulate high level foreign reserves, many seem worry possibility sudden outflow – oppose real problem associate large inflows. australia struggle occasion capital flow complicate role conduct monetary policy. but australia’s big problem conduct monetary policy come day capital flow restrict now, financial price regulated. in day – i refer period decision early 1980s allow market set exchange rate yield government debt – problem basically one monetary control: policy-makers could accurately control amount settlement fund available bank system domestic policy action control fund often over-run foreign operation undertake clear foreign exchange market nominate exchange rate. that fundamentally impair reserve bank’s capacity influence broad monetary conditions: actually control stance monetary policy. those day long gone. the market foreign exchange clear entirely private sector (unless make choice intervene). the government’s financial operation fund market-determined interest rates, relieve central bank obligation support particular price market. the result reserve bank able control total quantity settlement fund system, allow u set, practical purposes, overnight rate interest. that mean capital flow long concern, change location, view size, problem present. a deep financial system also absorb much large flow le disruption. more generally, 20 year experience, economy financial system show adjust even quite large change exchange rate without undue disruption. this involve reasonable amount learn part financial markets, business policymakers – and, occasion, learn curve fairly steep. but doubt present world preferable. the story get position interest one, story i would like tell today. let refer two episodes. when capital flow problem the first year 1983. at begin year, australia’s exchange rate regime crawl peg trade-weighted basket. (this regime place since 1976.) the peg determine daily management committee consist governor reserve bank head main economic government departments.1 this group set peg give assessment economic conditions, external internal factor take consideration. the intermediate target monetary policy m3 growth rate set government. the 1 the secretary treasury department prime minister cabinet finance. bi review 86/2006 1 reserve bank seek achieve combination open market operations, change various reserve ratio quantitative lend guidelines. interest rate various financial instrument process liberalise time, though important regulation (e.g. house loans) remain place. but capacity reserve bank control quantity settlement fund bank system, therefore influence broad monetary credit conditions, weak, commitment particular exchange rate, even one vary every day. an attempt tighten condition withdraw cash market, example, likely thwart simple expedient private sector borrow offshore convert proceed australian dollar price nominate central bank. this would reverse initial withdrawal cash. conversely, private capital decide move out, authority struggle keep system supply adequate liquidity. in lead-up march 1983 federal election, market anxious prospect change government. in week prior election, capital outflow amount 3 per cent total money stock, 1½ per cent australia’s annual gdp. this occur spite capital control still place, distinction current capital transaction blur market participant become adept circumvent controls. exporter skilled delay receipt devaluation anticipated, importer accelerate payments, service foreign currency debt. these swing cause operational difficulty maintain suitable condition money market. a achieve target m3 growth, i well recall, one involve forecast growth ‘money supply’ days, impossibility forecast size persistence capital flows, one major driver growth community’s monetary assets. the newly elect labor government respond crisis devalue australian dollar 10 per cent twi. this successful reverse flow fund generate capital inflow, exporters, example, bring onshore pent-up receipts. but problem far solved. late 1983, australia’s external position improving, due post-drought recovery rural sector, rise commodity price high demand mineral exports. the volume capital inflow gradually mounted, encourage australia’s positive interest differential major countries. this cause problem monetary policy reserve bank difficulty withdraw result increase cash bank system. the plan devise counter problem one gradual appreciation exchange rate (achieved adjustment daily fix), low short-term interest rate increase sale government security fund fiscal deficit, likely see longer-term yield increase. that is, think currency speculator would deter low short-term rates, notwithstanding high yield offer long end. this would help achieve m3 target reduce liquidity result capital inflow. the exchange rate management committee also seek add random element daily movement exchange rate, around general trend appreciation, reduce predictability movement exchange rate thwart speculation. a capital inflow continue mount november, reserve bank actually devalue australian dollar twi.2 attempt frustrate speculator unsuccessful. inflow continued. finally, exchange rate float 12 december 1983 remain capital control remove simultaneously. australia one country take decision float currency upward pressure, capital inflow could adequately absorbed. the decision rightly regard one important ever take australian government field economic policy, number reasons. most important perspective monetary policy, system control amount settlement fund system become fully effective first time. if reserve bank want tighten financial conditions, take fund system, private sector could long immediately offset get fund back sell foreign exchange reserve bank: long oblige buy sell foreign exchange give price. 2 g. debelle m. plumb (2006) ‘the evolution exchange rate policy capital control australia’, asian economic paper (forthcoming). 2 bi review 86/2006 in summary, operation monetary policy pre-float period significantly constrain external considerations, hamper capital flows. while quantitative target monetary growth, way exert require control order achieve outcome. eventually, system overtake event change it. over number years, evolve towards float exchange rate medium-term inflation target. let turn recent episode australia’s experience asian crisis, illustrate arrangement worked. when capital flow quite much problem at onset asian crisis mid 1997, australian economy grow around trend rates, domestic demand begin accelerate, underlie inflation 2 per cent. give inflation performance, monetary policy ease previous year require 2–3 per cent inflation target. thus, shock hit australian economy time reasonable shape stance monetary policy already relatively expansionary. export east asia account around one-third australia’s export time, decline output east-asian region represent significant negative demand shock australian economy. australia’s term trade also fell commodity price declined, exacerbate loss income. reflect expect negative effect australian economy, le demand australian asset (that is, ex ante, capital want flow out). twenty-five year earlier, situation would result large loss foreign exchange reserves, float exchange rate adjustment mostly bear exchange rate, australian dollar depreciate around 20 per cent. on previous occasions, large depreciation exchange rate lead rise inflation expectation pick-up inflation due high import prices, require increase interest rate contain eventually reverse inflation impulse. in contemplate whether policy response appropriate occasion, come view that, even though short term inflation forecast rise 3 per cent time, depreciation pass consumer prices, performance would likely consistent target thereafter. the forecast rise inflation expect persistent, partly contractionary impulse decline export demand would dampen growth. but, addition, credibility inflation target quite well established, could expect help keep inflation expectation check. the flexibility monetary policy framework allow validity assessment reassess time passed. in event, inflation rise le forecast, part decline pass-through exchange rate depreciation, well greater-than-expected disinflationary impulse asian region, put downward pressure foreign-currency import prices. a result, end 1998, lift interest rates, actually reduce slightly. so flexible inflation target serve useful framework within manage effect asian crisis policy response capital flow. we also used, occasion, intervention foreign exchange market counter downward pressure exchange rate, allow move considerable distance. the important aspect whole episode issue hand allow exchange rate move provide part mechanism help economy adapt asian crisis change capital flow bring about. this reduce disruption domestic economy and, importantly, compromise set monetary policy. it often remark decline exchange rate expansionary trade sector help economy period. that true, view much important point capital flow exchange rate change compromise conduct monetary policy, remain relatively expansionary, consistent need economy time. have world fix exchange rates, would able set policy way. broad macroeconomic consideration the change exchange rate regime, accompany improvement monetary control, would expect effect volatility key financial prices. in particular, would bi review 86/2006 3 likely that, thing equal, domestic interest rate would le volatile exchange rate volatile. shock form swing capital flow would show exchange rate le level domestic interest rates. of course, thing equal period. there well-documented decline macroeconomic volatility number country period, so-called great moderation.3 nonetheless, show graph 1, float exchange rate, interest rate considerably le volatile, highly likely, least case australia, change exchange rate regime, along reform establishment consistent medium-term framework monetary fiscal policy,4 make contribution decline macroeconomic volatility. there increase measure volatility exchange rate, though perhaps much might expected. prior float, change exchange rate infrequent large, authority make periodic adjustment fix parity response macroeconomic financial developments, include induce capital flow i describe above. in post-float period, increase volatility generally reflect frequent small change exchange rate, case determine market. and significant period float era, mid 1990s past two three year well, exchange rate volatility different towards end manage exchange rate era early 1980s. graph 1 3 o.j. blanchard j. simon (2001) ‘the long large decline u.s. output volatility’, brook paper economic activity, 1, pp. 135–164. 4 d. gruen g. stevens (2000), ‘australian

variability exchange rate necessarily costless, course. some people might argue create degree uncertainty exporter importers, allocate capital. but share australia’s real economy engage international trade, extent australians’ financial asset trade internationally, grow period. no doubt mostly result general open economy international system, difficult support claim exchange rate variability seriously impede developments. on contrary, i think serious potential problem internationally expose sector short-term exchange rate variability, medium-term misalignment exchange rate. allow market force move exchange rate make outcome much le likely. good monetary control afford flexible exchange rate, hand, unalloyed benefit sector economy, trade non-traded. l sound though never care world exchange rate moving, however, important add one caveat story. it this: strong monetary policy framework essential. indeed, plenty time movement exchange rate, especially downward ones, make reserve bank quite uncomfortable. look back, mostly period policy framework well developed, credible, today. on occasion, seem exchange rate move change confidence conduct economic policies, include monetary policy, australia. this feature 1980s, medium-term inflation target framework yet place, though episode early 1990s also troublesome inflation target really acquire strong credibility 1995. in episodes, monetary policy respond change exchange rate alter interest rates. but advent asian crisis, exchange rate decline lot, financial market develop sufficient confidence monetary policy framework able allow exchange rate job. the conduct policy period generally regard successful. conclusion capital mobility complicate conduct monetary policy. in australia, find complication arise float exchange rate – often trivial – order magnitude monetary control problem capital le mobile financial price heavily regulated. in system year now, inflation bi review 86/2006 5 target, rather exchange rate, anchor policy. when capital flow suddenly change, exchange rate free move absorb least part shock, able decide much shock show change financial condition australia. this seem pretty durable arrangement. of course, take time get position. i recognise many country region different position. many open, perhaps le scope allow large exchange rate move without significant first-round inflationary deflationary effects. others still work develop strong domestic monetary policy frameworks. hence, country probably tend worry flightiness international capital flow we. nonetheless, seem australia’s experience offer reasonable grind think that, time, problem contain sufficiently enjoy benefit openness capital flow without much cost. 6 bi review 86/2006 timothy f geithner: hedge fund derivative implication financial system remark mr timothy f geithner, president chief executive officer federal reserve bank new york, distinguish lecture 2006, sponsor hong kong monetary authority hong kong association banks, hong kong, 14 september 2006. * * * i want thank joseph yam invite hong kong occasion. we approach 10-year anniversary financial crisis 1997-99. those crisis remarkable scope country market affected, speed severity. the circumstance lead crisis vary across country regions, magnitude result damage real economy. but event one dynamic common - confluence sharp increase risk perception, subsequent action take financial institution investor limit exposure future losses. a asset price decline volatility increase response increase concern risk, firm move call margin, reduce position hedge losses. these individual action aggregate effect induce even large price decline heighten perception risk, ultimately propagate amplify effect initial shock. the dynamic i describe unique crisis late 1990s, damage overall economic activity leave wakes. systemic financial event spillover real economy persistent feature economic environment, financial market participant policymakers grapple challenge reduce incidence minimize severity, longevity impact broad economy. there lot understand challenges, know today did. in case crisis late 1990s, despite broad-based nature financial market turmoil, country capital cushion financial sector strong relative risk, great diversity institution financial system absorb losses, monetary authority position provide liquidity restore confidence, financial macroeconomic impact crisis relatively modest. where condition exist, damage acute. the u.s. economy appear become resilient financial shocks. over past two decades, u.s. economy experience several episode significant financial market strain. these episode associate spike risk perception significant market volatility within financial markets, none prove exceptionally damage term overall macroeconomic impact. the mild impact episode real economy contrast financial event “credit crunch” exacerbate 1990-91 recession. that episode characterize widespread reduction provision credit bank response loan loss need raise capital. the resiliency observe past decade good luck. it consequence effort regulatory, supervisory private financial institution address previous source systemic instability. risk management improve significantly, major firm make substantial progress toward sophisticate measurement control concentration specific risk factors. what seem critical prevent financial market turmoil translate significant reduction credit provision bank financial institution step take regulatory authority financial institution alike strengthen capital core financial system, measure manage risk. these effort notably manifest increase level risk-adjusted capital core system relative prevail early 1990s. in unite states, example, tier-one risk-based capital ratio stabilize near 8.5 percent, considerably high estimate level around 6.5 percent early 1990s. this base relatively crude measure risk, direction improvement right magnitude change significant. relative condition prevail early 1990s, high level capital core provide large buff shock enhance ability bank industry act critical stabilizer time stress provide liquidity corporate sector. when financial market bi review 85/2006 1 dry up, firm turn bank unused loan commitment line credit. bank position fund liquidity transaction deposit tend flow bank sector. in time crisis, appear u.s. investor run banks, away them. in view critical role efficient credit provision play economic growth development, benefit global economy get underpinnings stable, efficient financial system place substantial. at time, also know important market susceptible certain “market failures,” information asymmetries, incentive conflicts, moral hazard agency problems. by time distort incentive manage risk, market imperfection alter credit decision lead high overall level risk-taking may optimal economy whole. this provide classic rationale supervision regulation. supervision regulation potential help mitigate source market failure. the recognition market failure mean, course, policymakers capacity design solution effectively mitigate failure without raise others problems. the fundamental challenge policy achieve appropriate balance efficiency financial resilience. with much government intervention, innovation constrain system stifled. with little, probability systemic crisis may rise level unacceptably high. we judge appropriate balance standard whether reduce zero probability major financial crisis, failure large individual financial institution major reduction

resiliency we’ve see recent years, can’t assume standard risk-management practice consistent stability recent past one perform well future. this partly impossible know sure favorable macroeconomic condition financial sector stability interact reinforce other. that is, would financial sector outcome favorable weak macro environment? but probably important fact even push forward regulatory, supervisory risk-management efforts, financial markets, instrument institution continue evolve well. among notable change rapid growth innovation derivative great relative importance private leverage financial institutions, hedge funds. the change credit market accompany late wave innovation derivative large role play leverage financial institution market may exacerbate traditional source challenge financial markets. and present new challenge framework incentive constraint central bank supervisor set financial institutions. on balance, believe change financial environment likely come substantial benefit term overall market efficiency. in remainder remark today, i highlight benefits, also consider challenge present central bank government determine spectrum efficiency vulnerability crisis financial system operate, craft policy consistent achieve objective. 2 bi review 85/2006 change financial market since late 1990s in unite state major markets, policy design mitigate risk financial crisis rely primarily capital-based system supervision major financial institutions, reinforce measure improve market discipline. these policy evolve reflect fundamentally important role credit market play economy, well reality complex market susceptible range potential market failures. in think potential supervisory regulatory challenge present broad evolution financial system past decade, make sense first consider change may enhance market function mitigate least imperfection characterize markets. my remark mix see happen practice might expect thing work principle. to begin with, financial institution within regulate core financial sector become larger, industry considerably concentrated. the 10 large bank hold company hold roughly half bank assets, compare le third 1990. these institution operate great geographic scope offer broad range financial products, overall volatility earn change much relative capital. hedge funds, private equity fund leverage financial institution control increasingly large share aggregate financial capital play active role many asset market credit markets. although asset management hedge fund still represent relatively small share total financial assets, relative share increase significantly ability take substantial leverage magnify potential impact financial market conditions. these private leverage fund become important source protection regulate institution large seller credit insurance rapidly grow market credit default swaps. in term enhance overall market efficiency, growth private leverage institution expect provide benefit term improve liquidity, price discovery via arbitrage, diversity opinion diversification opportunity investors. the increase share asset manage private pool capital devote arbitrage activity improve overall function markets. in circumstances, increase trade participation contribute market liquidity make market le volatile. the ultimate benefit low risk market participants. this turn reduce risk premia associate hold financial assets, ultimately reduce cost capital. the rapid growth relative importance leverage financial institution accompany number structural change well. the total number fund grow dramatically. there large hedge fund private equity firms. great institutionalization, maturity risk management operational infrastructure large private funds, likely reduce operational risk. to extent change increase diversity firm strategy part financial system, hard measure confidence, heterogeneity provide diversification opportunities, foster efficient price discovery could help improve stability. these change market participant occur conjunction dramatic acceleration number type derivative instruments. these development likely important impact allow efficient distribution effective management risk. all change move market direction foster efficient allocation credit capital formation, thus enhance economy’s real growth potential. the available evidence consistent view change core supervise institutions, growth leverage sector rapid financial innovation strengthen efficiency resiliency overall financial system. a i mention start, broad range recent financial shock seem adversely impact real economy. the international financial crisis begin 1997 spillover nonfinancial sector unite states. the equity price collapse deterioration credit 2000 cause significant damage core institution u.s. market. the relatively limit damage cause operation failure 9/11 attack reflect strength capital position major intermediaries, well policy action federal reserve provide liquidity markets. more recently, series small financial shock experience since 2001, include corporate bond default 2001, corporate account scandal 2002, credit downgrade u.s. bi review 85/2006 3 automobile industry 2005, failure refco, sharp decline mid-2006 equity, commodity emerge market debt price cause little contagion market limit strain financial institutions. challenge the favorable balance efficiency resilience financial system observe recently course guarantee achieve favorable balance future. the prospect future stability depend part effective supervisor adapt policy response ongoing evolution markets. financial institution face strong incentive monitor limit risk profile risk-taking leverage counterparties efficient level benefit balance cost margin. this good firm also good society’s perspective. private pool capital capacity use extensive leverage amplify returns. this leverage acquire variety ways: repurchase agreement reverse repos, secure finance security lend derivative structure financial products. the ability fund take risk leverage constrain two external source discipline - return require investors, term dealers/financers will extend credit. in words, fund constrain willingness outsiders, collectively, take exposure fund. the willingness bank investment bank take exposure hedge fund turn influence capital supervisory framework apply institution discipline impose market. the effectiveness market discipline constrain risk-taking behavior financial firms, however, may compromise presence market failure type mention above. while issue heart risk management challenge provision credit broadly, rise relative size private leverage fund sector rise importance new derivative financial instrument may complicate design policy risk-management practice counteract traditional frictions. virtually type credit market suffer informational problem - consider challenge face bank assess risk associate lend small unrated company. but complexity new financial products, rapidity position change, lack long time series historical relationship seem likely enhance problem leverage institution operate new market credit derivatives. fund typically deal several different bank investment banks. the desire maintain confidentiality trade strategy traditionally lead firm quite opaque outsider reluctant give

risk management what implication challenge central bank supervisors? the change financial system we’ve see past decade don’t change principal objective policy - ensure core financial institution maintain adequate cushion capital relation risk, build great resilience infrastructure support financial markets. we limit ability predict source stress financial system, cushion core system robust, risk systemic crisis diminished, central bank great ability mitigate risk broad damage economy. the pace extent change financial market require supervisor work hard understand consequence change market practice incentive constraint impose financial institutions. let give two example evolve market practice may help alleviate one concern exacerbate another. collateral play increasingly important role counterparty credit risk management, particularly highly leverage counterparties. the increase importance variation margining play critical role counterparty credit risk management. these change help limit exposure core financial institution loss among leverage counterparties, also act exacerbate volatility, asset price decline force margin calls, add market declines. where initial margin thin relation potential exposure, counterparties expose adverse movement asset prices, situation stress action take reduce exposure loss likely great negative impact market dynamics. in market condition initial margin may low relative potential future exposure, self-preserving behavior leverage fund counterparties may likely exacerbate rather mitigate unexpected deterioration asset price market liquidity. a financial firm demand collateral, fund force liquidate positions, add volatility push asset prices, lead margin call effort major firm reduce exposure bi review 85/2006 5 future losses. in context previous discussion externalities, firms’ incentive minimize exposure amplify initial shock impose others negative externality broad disruption market liquidity. the fact potential adverse dynamic exist mean occur. the deviation price fundamental value time stress likely create incentive firm investor resource step provide liquidity. in words, market may capacity self-correct prevent disruptive loss liquidity. a second example recent trend lengthen lock-ups, implement redemption gate limit withdrawals, create special side-pocket account particularly illiquid investment hedge funds. each change may serve reduce liquidity risk fund, beneficial potentially reduce disruption force liquidation positions. they may also, however, reduce market discipline increase overall scale leverage assume funds. we don’t capacity ass confidence balance effect probability crisis severity market dynamic condition stress. what focus supervisory effort new context? clearly, capital supervision market discipline remain key tool limit systemic risk. the emergence new market participant leverage institution change that. i go focus three broad policy priority - risk management, capital margining practices, financial infrastructure. risk management we focus attention part risk-management process uncertainty great materiality risk can’t readily quantify highest. this mean attention risk factor measurement challenge complex. it mean attention assess potential exposure extreme event lie outside past experience, outside recent past. these challenge require use mix different analytical tool help illustrate range possible outcome dimension uncertainty apply measurement exposure. the focus specific estimate produce various type asset price movement stress events, uncertainty surround estimate magnitude potential underestimation losses. another way say probably need spend much time discuss limit quantitative output risk-management process estimate produce models. understand evaluate “tail events” - low probability, high severity instance stress - principal, extraordinarily difficult, aspect risk management. these challenge likely increase complexity financial instruments, opacity counterparties, rapidity large position change, potential feedback effect associate leverage positions. stress test scenario analysis become central process risk management, see substantial progress since 1998. the efficacy tool judge part extent capture, high frequency basis, full exposure firm sufficiently broad range adverse conditions, aggregate exposure specific type different risk factor type counterparties, potential interaction among factors, effect general loss liquidity confidence markets, constraint ability firm move reduce exposure losses. and, course, credibility risk-management process judge quality attempt estimate stress exposure, also impact result decision much exposure firm actually takes. in words, effective stress test must view tool monitor risk firm taken, actually influence change behavior. supervisor focus concentration exposure range different risk factors, concern particular moment recent source shocks. just general often accuse prepare fight last war, practice tend chase measure direct exposure implicate past crises, seem like plausible candidate future crises, whether real estate, hedge funds, structure financial products, emerge market particular industry. 6 bi review 85/2006 this may necessary desirable, challenge task risk management, generally don’t put position try substitute judgment market level direct exposure particular company industry prudent relative capital. the good approach look might happen firm’s loss various alternative, adverse state world, ass direct indirect effect

future exposure substantial. an even great challenge measure exposure firm simply direct effect failure particular hedge fund counterparty, broad distress might cause market participant impact exposure firm. the management direct indirect exposure need important focus attention. capital margin supervisor put considerable amount effort past decade design successor basel capital accord. the present regime good enough job capture risk major institution typically assume today. because understate amount capital require risks, overstate others, ignore still others, work put place replacement regime quickly confident viable alternative. the prudent, conservative approach move forward risk sensitive framework create good incentive prudent risk management, try extend life present accord. it critical broad effort fix capital regime reinforce attention supervisor margin practice limit around counterparty risk-management process within major financial institutions. the regulatory capital

development albania speech mr ardian fullani, governor bank albania, the economist's conference – first business roundtable government albania: identify new business opportunities, tirana, 14 september 2006. * * * honorable chairman, distinguish participants, i please today share discus views, future macroeconomic financial market development outline policy orientation. i look forward converse forum. it great opportunity well know institution, focus attention toward albania. i would like thank the economist conference express deep high appreciation venture. i confident member communities, foreign domestic, gather today leave forum clear image economic reality business opportunity albania offer. assist geopolitical condition actual state affairs, although small glance, albanian economy present numerous financial economic advantage incentives. recently albanian economy reach commendable macroeconomic equilibrium, sustain economic growth 5-6 percent, low inflation level well contain within 2-3 percent band, continuously shrink budget deficits. it pleasure emphasize bank albania policy rightfully credit earn accolade establish foreign domestic institution notable role accomplishments. monetary policy design implement line midterm country’s macroeconomic program: specific focus price financial stability let briefly summarize i believe late important developments, outline economic outlook. economic growth after significant electricity shortage end 2005, appear traditional growth promote industry like service (tourism) construction grow stable pace, contribute sustainable economic growth. build upon development well positive indicators, expect economy grow solid rate 5-5.5 percent. the main challenge remain ensure sustainability growth rates, even high long run. i believe respective albanian authority already identify major priority challenge fully converge bank albania views. just remind i would briefly summary priorities. build new, preferably alternative, energy source improve efficiency top priority. in view, sufficient reliable energy supply remain main concern achieve economic growth. provide solution problem priority verge increase global demand energy prices. speed privatization process remain state asset another important step forward. special attention pay structural reforms, particularly property right legal framework. in opinion services, construction particular agriculture remain drive force gdp growth come years. therefore i would strongly agree initiative encourage fdi’s sector attractive law measures. i believe fdi’s important provide long term stability foreign sector. moreover productivity growth usually follow fdi’s inflow play e significant role reduce current account deficit. our economy need foreign direct investment hence country credit rat constitute chief priority economy. it belief fdi’s represent regional rather individual challenge south east europe. country region must coordinate effort toward create regional market. regional infrastructure project significantly increase attractiveness competitiveness well international financial market awareness toward region. it improve confidence provide necessary economic incentive enter region lead high fdi’s inflow economy. bi review 85/2006 1 inflation our economy experience relatively long period stable prices. annual inflation figure measure consumer price index, last 12 month report 2.4 percent. both monetary fiscal policy important factor keep inflation low. however, recently inflation pressure accelerated. the fast growth credit economy, steep increase oil prices, administrative increase energy prices, well risk potential create inflationary pressure pose risk elevate inflation expectations. bank albania take necessary action ensure inflation rate 3 per cent tolerance band ± 1 percent, short long run. interest rate during recent year interest rate drop reflect ease monetary policy. this general trend financial asset either lek foreign currency. on average bank system apply 9.7 percent loan domestic currency. the yield 12 month government security drop minimum 5.74 percent june 2006. however, follow last decision bank albania late trend global markets, modest increase interest rate observe last three month domestic foreign financial instruments. we expect trend persist within next 6-12 months. bank system the albanian bank system continue expand. it solid, consolidate fully capitalized. the system consist 17 banks, 3 entirely domestically owned. bank network extend continuously include remote areas. bank product increase number improve quality. entrance market important european financial group create good competitive environment enhance efficiency. the expansion lend portfolio competitive lend rate deepen financial intermediation. late data show june 2006, asset bank sector reach 60 per cent albanian gross domestic product (gdp). rapid change bank system light credit boom, global market financial integration impose need high standard transparency, accountability governance bank system itself. not regard bank albania, public well. bank behave responsibly must integrate stability entire system utility function. financial system reform since year bank system constant process transformation. the financial sector assessment program (fsap) mark significant moment process. on behalf bank albania i would like thank imf wb, excellent effort professional transparent financial certification albanian financial system. bank albania remain much focus fulfil recommendation fsap follow priority institutional hierarchy. • bank albania increase access investment opportunity commercial bank security market. • the draft bank law completed. • automate clear house system operational. • the number electronic transfer increase significantly. there concrete evidence show continuous reduction cash economy. • bank albania extend supervisory authority non-bank financial institution operate within economic territory republic albania. • supervisory board bank albania increase transparency decision make process. minute release regularly bank albania website provide fresh info daily activity. 2 bi review 85/2006 • there significant progress establish credit information bureau. we hope end next year fully operational. • last least i would stress already present detail action plan remain part fsap recommendations. honorable participants, design implement monetary policy become challenging. globalization particular expose economy foreign shocks. in addition policy action ecb fed, exert impact albanian economy mainly due high extend currency substitution. rapid growth lend activity notable development among domestic factors. accord figure last two year credit economy expand equivalent 10-12 gdp percentage points. at rate expect reach 18-20 percent gdp end current year. be worth mention approximately 30 percent outstanding credit represent consumer credit, moreover 75 percent outstanding stock loan foreign exchange currency. this represent important development deserve scrupulous attention. our main concern relate inflationary pressure non-performing loan credit expansion might generate. in light development bank albania assess exist stance monetary policy provide enough stimulus curb aggregate demand. therefore july 2006 bank albania decide shift course monetary policy raise base rate (7 day repo rate) 25 basis points. we happy observe market react follow decision. however base short term inflation forecast presence several risks, i already explain above, bank albania perceive inflation pressure next 12 month remain elevated. currently cautiously evaluate extend market response assess whether action needed. simultaneously bank albania become increasingly concern regard quality loan portfolio. the accelerate pace credit expansion, pose challenge bank supervisory authority. the response challenge aim achieve macroeconomic stability, mean well capitalize bank system. with goal mind, bank albania, supervisory authority, intensify dialogue bank order find adequate consensus for: set realistic objective annual activity growth; contain credit expansion maintain good credit portfolio quality; strengthen internal control risk monitor systems; monitor carefully capital indicators. i would like use floor emphasize bank albania firm follow strictly requirement derive law regulatory framework. on part, make necessary modification supervisory regulatory framework target mention issue realistic flexible approach. the sole purpose conformist approach supervisory rules, provide cushion avoid potential future disturbance financial stability. finally i would like strongly emphasize business community, household economic agent bank albania make effort ensure consolidate general macroeconomic equilibrium albanian economy, specific role financial stability. i believe business community comprehend important mission. bank albania intend vocal regard prospect economic developments, none action come surprise. therefore i invite interpret signal fairly smoothly integrate decision make process. i would like remind medium term agreement imf focus policy orientation toward eu european exchange rate mechanism (erm) provide additional collateral pledge. thank the economist conference give opportunity i open take question share comments. bi review 85/2006 3 yves mersch: monetary policy time inconsistency uncertain environment speech mr yves mersch, governor central bank luxembourg, nobelux seminar, luxembourg, 11 september 2006. * * * 1 time inconsistency policy 1.1 about time inconsistency on october 11, 2004 fynn kydland edward prescott reward "bank sweden prize economic science memory alfred nobel". one reason grant so-called "nobel-prize economics", enrich economics profession insight change think economic policy. at first, research mean merely shed light execution control theory dynamic systems. all sudden, however, run problem, although seemingly harmless, direct work completely unexpected direction. they discover power expectation policy plan framework. in late 1960s, role expectation investigate thoroughly find important variables, may determine economic outcomes. academic like milton friedman edmund phelps strongly contribute line research framework monetary policy. late robert lucas introduce concept "rational" expectations. accord concept, individual form expectation rationally, use information available them. the information include function economy, objective government relevant variables. this concept imply government (or monetary authority) cannot systematically betray market participant pretend follow certain policy subsequently act differently. use argument, kydland prescott include government behaviour model assume individual form rational expectations. they show even government citizen pursue objectives, i.e. maximise welfare population, discretionary policy subject fundamental time consistency problem. the fundamental problem government policy optimal certain point time may optimal late on. since individual form rational expectations, realize government incentive deviate previously announce policy, behave accordingly. the point population’s expectation put extra constraint government policy government incentive deviate, consistent policy optimal optimal policy time consistent. if, example, government choose policy optimal certain point time, take account expectation previously form private sector. since private sector take economic decision base upon expectations, government policy time consistent. on contrary, government follow time consistent policy, would optimal. to illustrate theory, kydland prescott use accessible example following. imagine flood plain government want citizen build house would construct dam order protect houses. if house plain, however, would optimal government construct dam protect citizens. consequently, rational agent certain government go build dam protect plain, build houses, would best outcome economy whole. on hand, since citizen know that, house there, optimal choice government construct dam hence rational citizen build house flood plain. now, solution time inconsistency problem? the solution summarize one single word: commitment. commitment case mean government abandon control certain policy option order credibly communicate subject policy go change future. in example, government could enact law prohibit construct dam flood plain, imply decision dam would long hands, citizen would expect government change mind consequently would build house flood plain. bi review 84/2006 1 whenever time consistency problem arises, policy rule kind clearly superior discretionary policy. policy rule understand mechanism help government credibly commit certain policy prevent change mind late on. in domain monetary economics, issue policy rule pick late 1980s. most important work bennet mccallum also john taylor introduce famous "taylor rule". bound discretion versus explicit policy rule the idea behind rule give discretionary influence policy maker upon monetary policy. this make credible monetary policy depend upon predetermine factor include rule. since economic agent cross check results, credibility easily achieved. another advantage rule ease public determine expectations. under regime lead rules, least element guide monetary policy observable thus agent derive future monetary policy mean rule. but policy rule important drawbacks, end reason never use practice guide conduct monetary policy. john taylor note famous 1993 article "[…] operate rule require judgement cannot do computer". what mean policy rule disadvantage inflexible. since rule must include variable expense others, obviously ill-prepared unforeseen shock affect economy. for example demand shock might require quick response monetary authority order guarantee price stability. a solution problem consist use broad definition policy rule. taylor give example patent laws. if inventor obtain patent, right exploit certain principle couple years. the detail invention subject patent. in similar way, policy rule understand set objective target subject monetary authority take decisions. in sense, bound discretion systematic collection discretionary policy action which, leave flexibility react unforeseen events, offer credibility purposefulness rule. 1.2 time inconsistency policy there hardly scientific publication economics important impact day-to-day policy-making contribution kydland prescott. soon identify inherent time inconsistency problem optimal policy plan rational expectations, similar problem discover many area economic policy. the important influential one time inconsistency problem concern capital taxation fiscal policy output inflation trade-off monetary policy. although problem reside different domain public policy core remain same. in addition deal these, i also review peculiar kind time inconsistency relate fiscal sustainability. 1.2.1 fiscal policy one important find domain public finance ramsey principle optimal factor income taxation. develop 1927 economist frank ramsey, assert input factor low elasticity substitution tax most. in order keep distortionary effect taxation moderate possible, factor react least taxation tax most. since save today capital stock tomorrow, problem time inconsistency arise capital taxation. in order promote save assure capital stock tomorrow, government wary elasticity substitution capital. that say, government must account relatively high mobility capital. this imply set low tax rate capital income. ex-post however, capital installed, mobility drop zero. apply ramsey principle then, imply tax capital 100 %. of course rational individual would anticipate outcome, save first place. again government need commitment mechanism help credibly communicate won’t change mind. in case, reputation serf part mechanism. besides ramsey principle, time inconsistency could fee another avenue public finance. at give point time, government could tempt depart optimal strategy, 2 bi review 84/2006 i.e. fiscal soundness. they could, instance, increase public expenditure order accommodate demand median voter specific constituencies. this move would course result high deficit therefore future taxes. however, government position conceal uncomfortable message short even medium term, least "rational expectations" assumption relaxed. first, could make overly optimistic macroeconomic projection order hide challenge fiscal sustainability. second, could throw veil mist problem capitalise uncertainty inherent definition measurement sustainability, especially long-term horizon. in many cases, "true state world" disclose well government responsible high expenditure departed. this form time inconsistency quite peculiar distinct concept i refer far. in latter, already said, government might "betray" citizen pretend follow certain policy act differently ex post. in current, "peculiar" form concept, government would confuse citizen ex ante pretend follow rigorous fiscal policy. the "true state world" would manifest high deficit breach sustainability, probably would late address challenge efficient way. the government renege promise active way, implementation new, explicit measures, distort ex ante "true state world". two commitment mechanism could mitigate peculiar kind time inconsistency. first, independent budgetary institution could set up. they would endeavour lift veil uncertainty, instance conduct independent macroeconomic projections. these projection could cornerstone elaboration general government budget (central government, social security, state local governments). independent institution could also charge measure monitor fiscal sustainability base long-term projections. such institution already place many countries, particular small, open economies. let mention example belgium (high council finance), the netherlands (the central plan bureau provide independent macroeconomic budgetary forecasts), denmark (economic council) austria (government debt committee). in luxembourg, certain extent, bcl assume role independent fiscal institution. accordingly bcl staff continuously analysis situation structure luxembourg economy. this enable bcl comment fiscal sustainability time consistency policy action take government. example general government budget deficit, amount 1.9% gdp 2005 significant surplus 1993 2002 balance situation 2003. the bcl explicitly warn government risk fiscal balance well advance, already 2002. furthermore, demographical macroeconomic challenge pension system, widely acknowledged, subject bcl work paper 2003. the health system also scrutiny several issue bcl monthly bulletin. in respect bcl add independent critical point view policy government enhance consistency process policy-making luxembourg. the major problem bcl face independent monitor task absence sufficiently detail information budget outturns, particular regard direct tax implementation expenditure programme so-called "special" extra-budgetary funds. the set independent council – instance along line belgian "conseil supérieur de finances" – transparent flow information participant could help overcome problem. numerical fiscal rule multi-annual budgetary framework also essential respect. since constrain ex ante behaviour governments, instance via expenditure limits, scope time inconsistent policy narrowed. independent budgetary institution could charge monitor implementation fiscal rules. these institution could contribute improve definition fiscal rules, paramount importance. for instance, expenditure rule effectively influence budgetary outcome overlook transaction carry extra-budgetary institution funds. the rule definition would ideally enshrine law. the fact legal act difficult change protection time inconsistency. accord recent study european commission, legally bind rule tend efficient soft rules. 1.2.2 monetary policy in 1958 london school economics professor a. w. phillips publish article show empirical connection wage inflation unemployment. his data british wage inflation bi review 84/2006 3 unemployment rate cover timeperiod 1861 1957 show negative relation rate change nominal wage number people without job. of course idea trade-off employment inflation exist still tempt one politicians. the so-called phillips curve could interpret menu card allow politician choose whether want high inflation high unemployment. soon temptation follow many government try fight unemployment conduct inflationary monetary policy. however, attempt make exploit relationship, collapsed. the employment-inflation trade-off seem stable whole century break late 1960s early 1970s. all sudden, country try fight unemployment inflationary policy end both: high inflation unemployment. time inconsistency, could make responsible puzzle fact. moreover, solution collapse phillips curve become foundation modern central banking. the output-inflation trade-off example in late 1960s first half 1970s, reason breakdown relationship discover phillips found. it mainly due friedman, phelps lucas difficulty simplistic "menu-card" view politics unveiled. the newly discover expectation play main role arguments. the important thing comprehend, academic claimed, relationship unemployment inflation stable inflation expectation stable. if case, relationship would change structure, hence collapse. the phillips curve would simply shift. the key argument inflation expectation individual enter relationship unemployment inflation individual need measure inflation determine next periods’ real wage. in end, real variable like unemployment output determine real variable like real wage. once individual adapt expectation accommodative monetary policy monetary authority, monetary expansion like push string. it lead high inflation, leave unemployment unaltered. the time inconsistency nature problem lie fact unanticipated inflation lead low unemployment depress real wages. again, socially optimal strategy monetary authority change periods. ex-ante optimal follow restrictive monetary policy aim low inflation. ex-post however, expectation public formed, induce certain behaviour agents, optimal monetary authority defect produce "surprise"-inflation. the monetary authority, however, cannot permanently fool agent rational expectations, aware incentive monetary authority regress decision inflation. so end, attempt monetary authority exploit phillips-relationship doom produce inflation without reduce unemployment. a relate example luxembourgish context consist nominal wage-indexation rule, characterize wage set behaviour grand duchy. the wage-indexation rule may model phillips curve, prima facie, seem device stabilize inflation expectations, alleviate inflationary bias. however important caveat apply. wage-indexation per definition backward look information concern expectation ignored. moreover, prone supply shock strike economy may, second-round effects, heat wage-price spiral. recent oil price increases, name prominent example, feed price increases, turn trigger several increase index. through channel supply shock strong last effect would without indexation. several alternative resolve problem suggested, mostly exclude good high price volatility relevant inflation measure tie index price development neighbour countries. further caveat concern wage-indexation point introduce rigidity labour markets, hamper adjustment processes. lastly mitigate cost inflation wage earner may reduce fight inflation. hereby wage-indexation influence incentive hence credibility authorities. 4 bi review 84/2006 2 the monetary policy eurosystem time inconsistency problem 2.1 central bank time inconsistency problem the insight time inconsistency problem monetary policy make clear sort commitment device necessary order overcome inflation bias monetary policy. research show discretionary monetary policy certain equilibrium attainable presence rational agents. in 1980s several proposal make resolve problem. one idea monetary authority invest "good reputation" continuously fight inflation shape expectation private sector concern future inflation. in end economist kenneth rogoff show good solution delegate monetary policy independent central bank. the incentive set central bank would able make economic agent believe determination deliver price stability. for instance, one could make central bank president’s wage depend degree price stability policy delivers. new zealand go even accord employment contract, governor dismiss inflation rate exceed target. the governor bank england explain underlie reason present appropriate monetary policy measure inflation deviate 1 p. p. target set government. so delegate monetary policy independent central bank suppose allow good balance credibility flexibility. on grind argument central bank throughout world reform special focus give operational independence. independent central bank keep touch market guide market participant sensible monetary policy. the central banks’ obligation mainly twofold. on one hand central bank conduct monetary policy price stability maintained. on hand, central bank help stabilise economy, shake fluctuations. those obligation two side one medal utmost importance fulfil credibility. on february 7th 1991 treaty european union sign maastricht. after experience extend period high inflation mid 1960s mid 1980s, essential aim participate nation assure price stability. in order achieve this, aim price stability independence european system central bank (escb) enshrine treaty. next, i present strategy eurosystem you, thereby focus especially issue time consistency. 2.2 the eurosystem monetary policy a relatively young organisation, escb heart ecb able start cherish fruit research i presented. a result, many important result implement straightaway. the first foremost example thereof crucial role give price stability. to manifest importance, article 105 treaty european union stipulate primary objective escb "[…] maintain price stability". all objective subordinate this. obviously, make clear public, escb commit price stability only. to emphasise this, article continues: "[w]ithout prejudice goal price stability, escb shall support general economic policy community view contribute achievement objective community […]". 2.2.1 commitment device eurosystem a i described, important clearly state certain goal order influence expectations. the important presumably difficult part make statement credible public. in order make monetary policy ambition credible, eurosystem need device prove determination maintain price stability. a key ingredient, important, credibility, clear quantitative definition price stability. milton friedman, time, trust neither politician central banker thus advocate constitutional rule require constant money growth. constitution device well suit prove seriousness purpose. since hard change them, even politicians, provide bi review 84/2006 5 strong insurance government change mind. it certainly fact mind price stability target include article 105 treaty european union. a primordial prerequisite monetary union consider above-mentioned time inconsistency issues, treaty appropriate place define major objective escb. in order clarify target, govern council ecb define price stability october 1998 as: "[…] year-on-year increase hicp euro area 2 %". in may 2003 govern council narrow target restrain inflation rate "[…] close 2 % medium term". a clearly define appropriately fix objective one part ensure credibility. the part take responsibility result monetary policy. this give public opportunity hold eurosystem accountable. the fact target clearly define make easy evaluate result policy measure taken. accountability important since central bank independence difficult sanction actions. transparency key prerequisite accountability. an important part transparency lie definition target inflation rate. furthermore, step take achieve goal clarify well. an important instrument respect two-pillar strategy eurosystem. by analyse real monetary side economy subsequently cross check result analysis decision justified. moreover, policy decisions, taken, understand easily public, since underlie data publish regularly. the ecb try meet communication requirement wide range publication press conferences. the credibility independence monetary policy enhance fiscal discipline prevails. in spite monetary union, fiscal policy remain hand national states. in order guarantee soundness national budget avoid disruption mechanism monetary transmission induce fiscal imbalances, treaty stability growth pact put certain constraint upon ability member state run deficit make debt. 2.2.2 inflation expect inflation euro area central bank throughout world build reputation time. among best know obviously unite states’ federal reserve, bank england previously bundesbank. this tradition imply market participant experience central bank conduct monetary policy, react shock "hawkish" "dovish" inflation. reputation help central bank enhance credibility stabilize market reduce uncertainty. the eurosystem track record start mission 1999. market participant first collect experience eurosystem monetary policy conduct. since introduction euro 1999, average hicp inflation rate accord eurostat 1,97 percent, since 2000 average lie around 2,1 percent. this close price stability set. a i lay you, stabilise price imply stabilise expectation prices, since inflation expectation important economic process actual inflation is. in order gauge public’s assessment commit eurosystem fight inflation, i report result survey professional forecaster you. this survey carry ecb since early 1999, consist questionnaire expectation send expert affiliate financial non-financial institution base within eu. the expectation report several time-periods. for example, one year ahead inflation expectation start level 1,2 percent first quarter 1999. they reach temporary maximum second quarter 2002 value 1,9 whole period 1999 begin 2006 never cross 2 percent barrier. only recently, second quarter 2006, one year ahead inflation forecast rise 2,1 percent reflect oil price fiscal shock (i.e. german vat increase) euro area undergoing. concern longer-term expectations, forecast similar. expectation two year ahead hicp inflation rate vary mainly 1,5 1,9 percentage points. these result interpret proof confidence "expert" public ability eurosystem achieve target. important complementary indicator credibility eurosystem long term inflation expectations. these stable le affect different shock short term expectations. for example, short-term expectation moment influence rise oil price 6 bi review 84/2006 insecure political situation middle east. in long run, fundamental economic data relevance inflation expectations. long term average inflation expectation report ecb’s survey professional forecaster 1,9 % last 18 quarter consecutively. very similar result also extract survey like ‘consensus economics’ ‘euro zone barometer’. overall, eurosystem achieve credibility among market participants. this also important consider uncertain environment, govern council ecb faces, day-to-day decision-making. in follows, i go touch issue. 3 monetary policy uncertainty far deterministic world model researcher exactly predict effect change certain variable, real world, govern council ecb face monthly meetings. there many possible disturbance fee monetary framework uncertainty numerous respects. in recent past, deal terrorist attacks, asset price bubble extraordinary rise oil price, mention few. all event affect change structure framework central bank deal add uncertainty process conduct monetary policy. among many form uncertainty relevant central bank twofold. the first concern transmission mechanism monetary policy, second current state economy. concern mechanism monetary policy transmission first all, since introduction euro notice important move towards close integration capital market bank system. this impact repercussion way amount interest rate decision pass economies. nevertheless, since euro area still remain heterogeneous structure, pass-through may quick one region rather stodgy another. recent labour market reform several member state well change social security system influence transmission mechanism further. all continuously affect process hand euro area today may well quite different 1999. the second important source uncertainty concern state economy. again division make aggregate uncertainty uncertainty country level. among expert opinion always unanimous concern state economy. there many indicator many way interpret them, discriminate temporary slowdown economy begin recession sound recovery irrational exuberance always obvious. it wonder time reference make "art central banking". in order cope special situation euro area uncertainty general eurosystem apply several instruments, either substitute complementary other. to start with, solid foundation monetary policy created. the detail publish monetary policy strategy reduce uncertainty behalf public concern objective behaviour eurosystem. a i explain eurosystem try achieve high possible reliability mean clear objective high degree transparency accountability. the eurosystem try reduce uncertainty structure economy maximum extent possible systematize analysis full information set, i.e. renowned two-pillar strategy. by closely monitor real monetary side economic situation euro area, eurosystem gather available information cross check information, uncertainty reduce minimum. furthermore, order prepare broad change market structure foster understand economics heavy weight lay conduct genuine research. lastly consider remain uncertainty, policy generally conduct cautious manner. indeed, main body literature consider "non-activist" gradualist policy conduct optimal case parameter uncertainty. 4 conclusion kydland prescott show work time inconsistency policy, important government (or monetary authority) make policy credible among public. this lead widespread reform sector central bank throughout world mid- late- 1980s author maastricht treaty european union integrate insights. bi review 84/2006 7 by carefully adopt specific monetary policy strategy appropriate euro zone, eurosystem succeeded, even without track record spite many turbulence shock various markets, keep inflation low close target. moreover, inflation expectations, key indicator trust public policy eurosystem, also keep level compatible announce definition price stability. in conclusion time inconsistency problem well solve practice modern central banking, notably eurosystem. even uncertainty unforeseen events, past future prevail, ecb good start achieve credibility public. this achieve mean framework one hand deliver determination necessary credibility give flexibility essential react unforeseen events. reference eurostat (2006), harmonize index consumer prices, eurostat web page, download

mr lars nyberg, deputy governor sverige riksbank, foreign banker’s association, stockholm, 14 september 2006. * * * introduction let begin thank invitation. it pleasure able come talk riksbank monetary policy. when conduct modern monetary policy, important principle guide interest rate decision know all. monetary policy largely effect influence expectation future inflation interest rates. therefore, regularly describe view economic development inflation report publish minute monetary policy meet enable everyone understand consideration make. in addition, twice year governor riksbank hold public speech riksdag (the swedish parliament) committee finance respond question member parliament journalists. moreover, executive board member hold large number speeches, discus various aspect swedish economy explain interest rate decisions. i say continuous debate monetary policy term necessary condition policy function satisfactorily. one difficulty monetary policy immediate impact. it therefore necessary base monetary policy decision forecast future inflation development real economy. of course, forecast uncertain also make different ways. one main purpose inflation report explain make them, others question u discus methods. i shall return forecasts, recently change method area. during spring i colleague executive board describe number speech principle guide monetary policy. in may also publish special document describe principles.1 one reason consider important publish document lively debate monetary policy time disparate opinions. for instance, people consider one objective monetary policy, addition inflation target. others claim already one objective, debater point one objective risk create confusion. although debate quite lively since – may course connect fact long, pleasant summer may turn people's think matter monetary policy – i see monetary policy still sometimes describe way i really recognise. two question particular tend arise: do take account inflation, also care real economy, instance, employment situation? and think rapid increase household indebtedness property prices? the aim monetary policy to understand monetary policy decisions, course essential uncertainty regard objective monetary policy. there one statutory objective monetary policy maintain price stability. we riksbank choose specify objective term explicit inflation target. this entail annual change consumer price index (cpi) 2 per cent tolerance interval ± 1 percentage point. one might ask allow certain measure inflation parliament give u task maintain price stability. one reason choose set inflation target zero inflation target low certain circumstance create adverse condition employment. there inbuilt resistance within economy nominal reduction price 1 see “monetary policy sweden", sverige riksbank (this document download riksbank’s website, www.riksbank.com, order booklet). bi review 84/2006 1 wage certain measure inflation therefore make easy implement necessary change relative price wages. a consensus develop among country economic policy aim price stability reasonable rate inflation around 2 per cent. at time, i would like point scientific grind determine exactly inflation target formulated. of course, impossible ambition inflation always close two per cent situations. the economy expose unexpected shock cannot immediately counteract monetary policy’s impact come time lag. an attempt bring inflation back target quickly may also lead unnecessarily large cost real economy. let explain i mean here. monetary policy care real economy if inflation reason inflation target, necessary decide quickly bring back target. in situation good reason good opportunity take account development real economy merely prices. if, instance, increase price energy bring inflation well two per cent, would possible use large interest rate hike quickly bring inflation back target. however, price form slow economic growth. if high productivity growth low import price instead lead inflation well two per cent, might possible correct problem quickly cut interest rate. however, would risk stimulate economy way would always desirable. by bring inflation back target slow rate, real economy develop stable manner. we thus contribute stability, although monetary policy cannot affect long-term growth rate economy. it state law riksbank take development real economy account addition price stability target. on hand, state preparatory work sverige riksbank act riksbank, without prejudice price stability target, support goal general economic policy view maintain sustainable level growth employment. not ambition bring inflation back target quickly possible thus create flexibility formulate monetary policy provide scope take account development real economy. at time, important flexibility give rise doubt maintain inflation target long term. this choose specify time horizon, state monetary policy normally aim achieve inflation target within two years. the two-year horizon interpret restriction much consideration normally give real economic developments. it restriction impose upon – like specify inflation target – create credibility price stability target. similar reason lie behind set tolerance interval choose around target. while tolerance interval provide interval within inflation normally expect fluctuate result unexpected shock insufficient knowledge exactly monetary policy affect economy, provide limit size deviation tolerated. however, let point certain situation shock economy great reason allow even long two year bring inflation back target. if assessment situation arisen, would make clear publish monetary policy decisions. one condition find situation would risk undermine confidence inflation target monetary policy. these think take account development real economy course unique riksbank. although guideline inflation-targeting monetary policy vary slightly one country another, central bank inflation target conduct monetary policy extent take account real economy. this usually term flexible inflation-targeting. in words, “inflation nutters”, want bring inflation back target quickly possible, whatever cost. the importance inflation forecast interest rate decision let move talk assumption repo rate use make forecast inflation report. 2 bi review 84/2006 the forecast main scenario riksbank’s inflation report base year assumption repo rate hold unchanged forecast period. this assumption advantage provide simple clear policy rule monetary policy: if forecast inflation end forecast period two per cent, repo rate would normally cut, two per cent interest rate would raised. if forecast close two per cent repo rate would remain unchanged. of course, rule could capture nuance monetary policy discussion, provide rough explanation monetary policy decisions. however, several disadvantage assumption constant repo rate. in situation market expect clearly rise fall interest rates, difficult compare forecast base assumption constant repo rate make forecasters. one reason assumption constant repo rate often result forecast inflation differ forecasters; high inflation rise low inflation declining. this cause confusion discussion monetary policy. since october last year, forecast instead base technical assumption repo rate develop line market expectation regard future repo rate, express imply forward rates. this make easy compare inflation forecaster also ass monetary policy.2 the new interest rate assumption apply mean long use old policy rule. if forecast constant repo rate close two per cent, repo rate would hold unchanged accord old policy rule. if forecast accord new outlook show inflation close two per cent, repo rate normally develop way reflect market expectations. this could mean repo rate, give underlie inflation forecast, raise low number stage come two-year period. the new outlook thus mean monetary policy discussion base interest rate path throughout entire forecast period, old policy rule take account do time decision made. i see several example old policy rule use discussion concern new interest rate path. this fatal, lead entirely wrong expectation monetary policy. the old policy rule dead market need bury it. even new outlook care development real economy make monetary policy decision. if, instance, forecast inflation rate close target two year ahead, show rapid acceleration time growth real economy high, possible imply forward rate path could expect reflect desirable development repo rate. in type situation possible repo rate would need raise quickly begin forecast period. when make decision regard repo rate, thus merely look see whether inflation close target two year ahead, take account entire development path inflation real economy. a desirable monetary policy characterise inflation normal circumstance close inflation target two-year time perspective time path inflation real economy exhibit excessively large fluctuations. for record, i would like point forecast assumption repo rate follow imply forward rate course entail commitment riksbank case. we unique information future. we cannot advance commit monetary policy particular sequence future interest rate changes, future economic development uncertain. the stand take regard development repo rate monetary policy meet base information available time decision made. our consideration change economy develop manner different expected. 2 this describe box entitled, ”changes riksbank’s forecast methods”, inflation report 2005:1, irma rosenberg’s speech ”the riksbank monetary policy” danske bank, 29 september 2005 lars heikensten’s speech, ”thoughts develop riksbank’s monetary policy work”, swedish economics association 22 february 2005. bi review 84/2006 3 manage risk monetary policy decision a monetary policy must base uncertain forecast future, need manage risk economy develop way different expect central bank. the former federal reserve governor alan greenspan call risk management approach policy. give way thinking, inflation report contain special section discus alternative scenario inflation real economy probability materialise. it forecast inflation real economy take account risk alternative scenario form basis monetary policy decisions. of course, appropriate risk analysis take account imaginable risks; even would dramatic consequence materialise. for instance, reasonable, opinion, allow monetary policy decision govern risk global imbalances, unable affect development monetary policy.3 on hand, i consider important always take account risk arise monetary policy conducted, even sometimes difficult quantify risk calculate consequences. one problem face many central bank inflation targets, relate this, risk unfavourable development property price household indebtedness result long period expansionary monetary policy. sweden exception here. both cyclical structural factor justify growth rate household debt property price high period time sweden thus reason take account normal analysis forecast work. rise house price lead wealth effect influence decision regard consumption saving. development debt affect impact interest rate change consumption. this necessarily entail dramatic consequences. however, rate increase remain high level long period time, increase risk imbalance build debt house prices. this could bad case scenario lead large fluctuation inflation real economy ahead. the question manage risk type imbalance occurring. one way manage similar risk make change repo rate sooner late would otherwise assess appropriate timing, give forecast inflation real economy. let illustrate brief summary reason connection monetary policy decision make february year. we raise repo rate, despite fact inflation forecast could warrant wait time implement increase. our assessment circumstance indicate repo rate increase february, could thereafter raise slightly slow rate. the expansionary monetary policy conduct recent years, together weak krona, stimulate economy considerably. it contribute situation household indebtedness house price increase rapid rate regard sustainable long term. our assessment monetary policy meet february slightly early increase repo rate would reduce risk abrupt adjustment house price household indebtedness ahead, might adverse consequence inflation real economy. one could say that, bear risk mind, discuss appropriate time interest rate increase anyway consider necessary regard inflation target. i colleague executive board riksbank point several different speech procedure mean introduce objective monetary policy addition price stability target aim contribute subdue fluctuation real economy. we express quite clearly special document monetary policy strategy publish prior summer. it therefore surprise i still see monetary policy describe contest way imply objective besides price stability make decision repo rate. i would also like emphasise management risk adverse development house price household indebtedness way mean consider aspect 3 see also tucker, p., (2006), "reflections operate inflation targeting”, bank england quarterly bulletin: summer 2006. 4 bi review 84/2006 great relevance regard desirable monetary policy than, instance, situation labour market. from time time situation arise need take account, different way usual, risk adverse economic development difficult quantify. recently house price household indebtedness, future could variables. this important dimension flexibility inflation-targeting policy. the current situation let conclude comment recent monetary policy decision. a detail account provide separate minute monetary policy meeting, publish day yesterday. we choose monetary policy meet 29 august raise repo rate 0.25 percentage points. now choose conduct le expansionary monetary policy, make assessment necessary avoid inflation target couple year ahead, time contribute balance development real economy. the increase repo rate line repo rate path expect market use basis inflation forecast. on one hand, high gdp growth indicate inflation could rise quickly future assume june. but hand, productivity slightly strong expected, contribute hold back cost development rate increase unit labour costs. this dampen effect inflation. however, indication labour market begin strengthen, contribute rise cost pressures. our overall assessment inflation increase line target couple year ahead, give repo rate increase approximately line market expectations. our assessment monetary policy meet upside risk downside risk roughly equal. among upside risk mention high energy, oil electricity prices, risk contagion effect high rate wage increase follow good growth economy. the downside risk include continue strong domestic productivity growth international price pressures. with regard household indebtedness house prices, expect growth rate slow down, yet see certain sign this. the picture paint early year still remain largely unchanged. our assessment throughout year outlook inflation economy come year indicate reasonable assume repo rate need gradually increased. in accordance view, raise repo rate four time far year assessment repo rate need raise future. however, i mention earlier, change assessment economy develop manner expected. thank you! bi review 84/2006 5 susan schmidt bies: basel ii commercial real estate testimony m susan schmidt bies, member board governor u federal reserve system, subcommittee financial institution consumer

u.s. bank organization security firm subject similar capital requirements. move main focus today's hearing, basel ii framework represent important effort supervisor integrate modern risk-management practice regulatory capital requirements. we please four federal bank agency reach consensus move ahead process basel ii market risk update. we recognize significance development industry, congress, others wait great specificity u.s. effort implement basel ii. it take quite bite work reach point. i would like thank colleague table staffs, well fed's staff, tireless efforts. overview propose rulemakings the basel ii npr design improve risk sensitivity u.s. bank regulatory capital requirement enhance risk-measurement -management practice large, internationally active u.s. bank organizations. the npr base 2004 capital adequacy framework release basel committee bank supervision. that framework contain now-familiar "three pillars" minimum capital requirement credit operational risk (pillar 1), supervisory review (pillar 2) public disclosure (pillar 3). a aware, agency propose adopt three pillar unite states. in pillar 1 propose basel ii npr, advance internal ratings-based approach (a-irb) credit risk advance measurement approach (ama) operational risk would available, framework whole would require largest, complex, internationally active u.s. institutions. in contrast, many country bank organization require adopt basel ii basel i drop basel ii take effect. to make basel ii appropriate wide variety financial bi review 84/2006 1 institutions, three credit risk three operational risk approach develop 2004 framework. the a-irb approach credit risk basel ii npr require institution estimate key risk parameter type credit exposure, subject supervisory review, calculate capital requirement use risk parameter inputs. the ama approach operational risk require institution calculate capital requirement base individual operational risk profile - again, subject supervisory review. the basel ii npr also specifies, part pillar 2, institution must develop rigorous internal process assess overall total capital adequacy relation risk profile type risk economic cycles. these internal assessment enable institution determine appropriate level capital unique long-term business strategy. these internal capital assessment are, believe, critically important, also subject supervisory review. finally, institution must publicly disclose key information relate credit operational risks, pillar 3, ensure adequate transparency market participants, customers, counterparties, market discipline also work effectively differentiate risk exposure among bank organizations. i would like stress basel ii framework three pillar note pillar 2 3 critical component overall framework. they overlooked. to accompany basel ii market risk proposals, agency plan publish federal register report requirement institution plan adopt basel ii update market risk rule unite states. each institution qualify apply basel ii capital rule update market risk rule would file quarterly regulatory data, would remain confidential, agencies' use assess monitor level component report entity's risk-based capital requirement adequacy entity's capital. these data also would support agencies' effort analyze quantitative impact competitive implication basel ii capital rule update market risk rule individual report entity industrywide basis. in addition, report schedule help clarify entity expectation surround system infrastructure necessary implementation validation two proposals. the submit data would supplement on-site examination processes, data release publicly would provide interest party information banks' risk profile capital adequacy. importance regulatory capital proposal while reason move basel ii change since begin endeavor, i believe worth reiterating. our core reason current basel i framework inadequate largest, complex u.s. bank organizations. the current basel i capital requirement simply able capture full array risk face organizations. for example, explicitly recognize operational risk embed many service large institution generate good portion revenue today. further, basel i differentiate riskiness asset within major asset type base either borrower creditworthiness presence collateral risk mitigants. this lack sophistication lead significant distortion capital arbitrage. the capital require various type exposure reflect unique business strategy institution, rather base assume homogeneous risk position. a bank consciously choose take high risk exposures, basel ii require hold additional capital reflect business choice. basel i capital fix throughout economic business credit cycles, such, require bank increase capital potential loss rises. basel ii address include pillar 2 requirement bank plan place ensure sufficient capital available downturn economic cycle. thus, large organizations, need move beyond basel i risk-sensitive comprehensive framework assess capital adequacy. basel ii represent concert effort international u.s. supervisory community, consultation bank stakeholders, develop framework, draw upon well-known economic capital concept large bank already employ part risk management efforts. in addition supervisory authority, federal reserve, nation's central bank, responsibility maintain stable financial market ensure strong financial system. that responsibility mandate require bank organization operate safe sound manner adequate capital appropriately support risk take. this especially critical today's environment grow number bank institution $1 trillion 2 bi review 84/2006 assets, complex balance sheets, opaque off-balance sheet transactions, far-reaching operation pose significant risk-management challenge fundamentally different face small institutions. naturally, must also ensure regulation supervisory oversight tune bank practice, able identify risk take bank today, enough flexibility continue prudent relevant ever-changing risk environment. a chairman bernanke noted, regulatory supervisory system tune financial marketplace may increase cost regulation, stifle efficiency innovation, ultimately le effective mitigate moral hazard problem associate federal safety net. the advance approach basel ii much risk sensitive, cover area potential risk face bank organizations, provide incentive institution improve risk measurement management. in addition, basel ii provide supervisor conceptually consistent transparent framework evaluate systemic risk bank system, particularly credit cycles. in sum, basel ii establish coherent relationship regulatory measure capital adequacy day-to-day supervision banks, enable examiner good evaluate whether bank hold prudent level capital give risk profiles. continue implementation process the agencies' propose rulemakings, represent view basel ii implement unite states, publish federal register review industry, congress, general public. the core goal basel ii, note earlier, promote stability u.s. financial system ensure safety soundness u.s. banks. a chairman bernanke said, ability basel ii promote safety soundness first criterion propose basel ii framework judged. the agency present proposal engage continue dialogue interest party whether proposal meet state objective improved. during entire process develop propose rulemakings, agency engage dialogue industry, congress, others direction u.s. basel ii implementation take specific implementation details. many comment receive date incorporate proposals. in respect, carefully consider comment receive far discuss among address them. in addition, conduct extensive analysis information collecting, result quantitative impact study (qis), result help shape proposal well. in make adjustment proposal base comment new information, transparent possible. go forward, seriously consider comment proposals. for example, proposal contain number specific question solicit comment key areas. with questions, agency try highlight area agency would like additional information. the agency continue carefully consider comment receive thoroughly analyze relevant information work develop final rule basel ii. i also want acknowledge agency receive comment several bank party suggest bank choice regard credit operational risk basel ii unite states. we take comment seriously npr include specific question whether u.s. version basel ii include so-called "standardized" approach credit risk. we look forward receive detail comment aspect proposals. the agencies' proposal contain certain transitional safeguard beyond contain 2004 framework. indeed, propose safeguard reflect intent ensure material weakness proposal prior full operation. first, continue monitor institutions' progress toward satisfaction basel ii risk-measurement -management infrastructure standards. in addition, proposal contain parallel-run period ability analyze directly compare capital requirement exist rule produce basel ii institution remain subject current rules. beyond parallel run, agency propose three-year transitional floor period, stringent 2004 basel ii framework, prevent unwarranted decline capital levels. in addition, current supervisory safeguards, exist leverage ratio prompt corrective action, continue provide important backstop potential unwarranted decline bank capital levels. in general, federal reserve see u.s. basel ii proposal work intended, seek modification them. bi review 84/2006 3 proposal amend exist basel i rule at point, i would like say word ongoing effort revise exist basel i regulatory capital rule non-basel ii institutions. we expect one two dozen institution move u.s. version basel ii near term, mean vast majority u.s. institution continue operate basel i-based rules, intend amend separate rulemaking process. the u.s. basel i framework already amend twenty-five time since introduction response change bank product bank environment result good understand risk individual product services. the agency believe another appropriate time propose modification basel i rules. the agency issue advance notice propose rulemaking (anpr) discuss possible change increase risk sensitivity u.s. basel i rule mitigate competitive distortion might create introduce basel ii. we review comment anpr work notice propose rulemaking. we mindful amendment basel i rule complex burdensome large number small- mid-sized institution revise rule might apply. indeed, number comment anpr advocate leave exist rule unchanged. with regard basel ii proposal propose basel i amendments, understand need full transparency. for reason, expect overlap comment period basel ii npr npr propose basel i amendments. in fact, want interest party compare, contrast, comment two proposal overlap timeframes. accordingly, either proposal could change result comment receive new information gathered. conclusion from federal reserve's perspective, forthcoming publication interagency proposal relate basel ii positive development demonstrate ability agency work cooperatively modernize regulatory capital framework. the federal reserve's commitment basel ii process remain strong ever, even recognize proposal remain subject comment likely much work done. we encourage comment interest party give careful consideration. i would like emphasize federal reserve desire ensure final rule basel ii substantial enhancement exist basel i rules, appropriately capture risk largest, complex banks, encourage continual improvement risk-measurement -management systems. we look forward work agency enter final rule phase basel ii process. we recognize many institution diligently prepare basel ii implementation understand obligation, supervisors, support institution want adopt basel ii first available date. we suggest institution continue move forward implementation planning, include identification gap preparation. finally, i would like assure subcommittee member federal reserve pursue basel ii believe help preserve safety soundness nation's bank system. in dual role central bank supervisor banks, bank hold companies, financial hold companies, federal reserve commit ensure basel ii framework deliver strong risk-sensitive base capital large complex bank institutions. that stand behind additional safeguard contain basel ii npr ensure strong capital level transition new framework. we remain vigilant, ongoing basis, monitor assess impact basel ii individual aggregate minimum regulatory capital requirement employ rigorous thorough analysis support evaluation. by doing, believe proposal discuss today implement responsibly safe sound manner. propose interagency guidance commercial real estate concentration risk the four federal bank thrift regulatory agency issue joint propose guidance january 2006 sound risk management commercial real estate concentrations. the comment period close april. the propose guidance generate significant interest. the federal reserve receive 1,600 comment letter propose guidance. typically, comment raise concern 4 bi review 84/2006 intent purpose propose guidance. over past months, federal reserve federal bank agency review comment carefully meet industry trade group individual bankers. in testimony today, i would like provide perspective agency concern cre concentration risk may pose, saw need issue propose guidance. i also address intent propose guidance misconception arisen. first, i would like explain define commercial real estate. for purpose guidance, cre loan include land development construction loan (both commercial 1- to-4 family residential construction) loan secure raw land, multi-family property, nonfarm nonresidential property primary significant source repayment derive rental income associate property proceed sale, refinancing, permanent finance property. the propose guidance apply owner-occupied cre loan majority repayment come income borrower's business operations. over past dozen years, agency observe material rise cre concentration many banks. for small- medium-sized banks, particular, growth cre concentration significant. this growth cre concentration understandable community-based bank experience increase competitive pressure large bank financial service institution lend areas. we recognize asset concentration can, practical basis, difficult avoid due institution's marketplace, area expertise, competitive environment. however, experience amply demonstrated, large grow asset concentration see today bank adversely affect banks' earn capital, indeed banks' safety soundness, properly managed. for reason, prudent bank long understand importance manage credit concentration risk - one basic tenet bank federal reserve long emphasized. so exactly concentration credit risk pose institutions? concentration credit generally define group class loan credit exposure share common risk characteristic sensitivity adverse economic, financial business developments. for give concentration, weakness develop common risk factor factors, loan within concentration may adversely affected, even every individual loan underwrite prudently. a bank supervisors, see danger credit concentration previous cre credit cycles. let provide detail trend observed. cre concentration almost double 1992 2005 commercial save bank asset $100 million $10 billion. during period, bank asset $100 million $1 billion, cre concentration rise 160 percent 294 percent capital, asset $1 billion $10 billion, cre concentration rise 143 percent 266 percent capital. why agency focus cre concentration risk? the agency concern high cre concentration would make institution vulnerable adverse change cre markets. cre market tend among cyclical, prone boom bust economic cycles. this poorly underwrite project overbuilding market significant negative effect cre loan soundly underwritten. to increase occupancy rates, weak project may low rent provide generous term attract tenants. this turn reduce cash flow strong property put credit risk. a know, late 1980s early 1990s, concentration cre lending, couple weak underwrite depress cre markets, contribute large credit loss banks, significant number bank failures, financial stress many banks. after recover severe credit loss cre downturn, u.s. cre market enjoy benign conditions. but investment cre grow strongly, expect bank ass vulnerability portfolio loss expectation next downturn. compound concern rise cre concentration feedback examiner institutions' risk-management practice keep pace growth cre concentrations. supervisory staff find weakness fundamental risk-management area board management oversight, risk assessment, monitoring. in addition, examiner bi review 84/2006 5 observe institution always sufficiently address cre concentration risk strategic capital planning. we also carefully monitor underwrite standards. while u.s. cre market generally perform well, underwrite term condition soften past couple years, albeit extent see late 1980s early 1990s. loosen loan covenants, expand interest-only periods, extend amortization example weaken underwrite term currently observing. capitalization rate cre project - measure expect investor return real estate investment - also near historical lows, raise concern collateral value loan-to-value ratio event capitalization rate return historical mean levels. many banker argue agency already supervisory tool available address concern concentration individual bank guidance would add unnecessary regulatory burden. our current real estate lend guideline issue 1993 federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act. the issuance guidance bank examiner one important supervisory tool focus attention emerge risk issue become large problem articulate supervisory expectation institutions. give rise concentration levels, current stage cre cycle, believe need additional cre guidance reinforce build upon exist guidance ensure consistent supervisory approach. it important stress intent propose guidance restrict cre lend rather provide framework safe sound cre lend program. the agency recognize financial institution play vital role provide credit communities. the main message propose guidance bank institution need identify manage credit-concentration risk appropriately. under propose guidance, would expect bank strengthen management practice concentration risk grow. the propose guidance set forth risk management practice well within capability many institution and, fact, number institution already many practice place. not surprisingly, establishment explicit threshold proposal generate significant controversy. banker argue threshold arbitrary view hard lend limit examiner industry. i want re-emphasize agencies' intent propose threshold limit institution's cre lend ensure risk-management practice commensurate activity. rather, threshold view supervisory screen examiner use identify bank potential cre concentration risk. examiner would expect organization strengthen portfolio risk management cre concentration grow. institution expect conduct analysis cre concentration risk establish concentration limits. institutions, all, best position identify understand concentration risk. another significant concern express comment letter banker propose guidance implement inconsistent manner, create uneven play field bank face high supervisory expectations. issue guidance interagency basis encourage consistent supervisory approach. further, agency also develop interagency train material new guidance examiner support effective consistent implementation. another concern express banker examiner take "one-size-fits-all" supervisory approach consider bank's specific portfolio characteristic risk-management practice apply guidance. the supervisory evaluation institutions' cre concentration risk would always conduct case-by-case basis, take consideration institution's analysis cre concentration risk. the diversity institution's cre portfolio, effectiveness institution's risk-management practices, presence factor mitigate risk would key consideration supervisory evaluation level institution's cre concentration risk. banker comment also express concern examiner evaluate capital adequacy bank cre concentration. the propose guidance address capital adequacy principles-based manner, note institution hold capital commensurate level nature risk, include concentration risk. this message entirely consistent 6 bi review 84/2006 agencies' exist capital adequacy guidelines. in evaluate capital adequacy, agency consider, example, level nature inherent risk institution's cre portfolio well management expertise, historical performance, underwrite standards, risk-management practices, market conditions, loan loss reserve allocate cre concentration risk. moreover, quality institutions' risk-management practice significant consideration evaluation capital adequacy. our concern capital adequacy reduce institution strong risk-management practices. on hand, institution inadequate risk management prospect near-term improvement, could concern institution may sufficient capital serve buff unexpected loss cre concentrations. finally, bankers' comment express concern issuance propose guidance might affect availability cre credit. the propose cre concentration guidance intend limit discourage institutions' cre lending. we recognize lend important business activity banks. we also believe cre concentration risk safely managed. in regard, propose guidance simply intend reinforce build upon exist guidance risk-management practice address risk arise concentration cre lending. in conclusion, although sometimes unpopular strategy loan performance good, believe far prudent, indeed responsibility, work proactively address small emerge issue help prevent evolution large problem bank industry economy whole. that feel important issue guidance time. thank much attention. i welcome comment may happy answer questions. bi review 84/2006 7 erkki liikanen: finland – “a land between” heart europe speech mr erkki liikanen, governor bank finland, dinner informal ecofin, helsinki, 8 september 2006. * * * ministers, colleagues, dear friends, this second time european leader din house. the first time spring 1953, robert schuman, father european coal steel community former french prime minister, receive dinner. the host colourful controversial cabinet minister, väinö leskinen. schuman invite finland foreign trade association guest speaker. his visit create strong negative reaction soviet union. a week late pravda write visit undeniably connect discussion step trade finland soviet union. in climate, government want devote official attention robert schuman. president paasikivi, however, receive write memoirs: "i explain view position finland. he understand well. schuman indeed intelligent charm man". today, episode seem long ago. europe divide two hostile blocks. finland follow european construction distance, all. the destiny country always link relation great powers. we "a land between". also culturally, finland show many influences. we get much stockholm, famous german university towns. architecturally, neo-classic centre helsinki resemble st. petersburg. a political entity, finland emerge result peace treaty tilsit, 1807. napoleon encourage russian emperor conquer finland sweden. alexander i succeed establish autonomous grand duchy finland , rule constitutional monarch – although remain autocrat russia. important institution country develop autonomy, long independence. for example, bank finland establish 1811. it fourth old central bank. finland obtain monetary system 1860. it see mean integrate country's monetary system european monies. the currency, markka, define equal french franc metallic content. the construction community hall begin 1906 helsinki workers' association. in year, finland become first country europe grant universal suffrage woman men. finland become independent 1917. independence follow three month tragic civil war. however, democratic institution survive cease function, even second world war. this build play role many event political history. it severely damage civil war, serve headquarter insurgent reds. later, landmark meet take place struggle social democrat communist control trade unions. now wonderful art nouveau house major conference centre, dinner serve french multinational company. quite symbolic. and even proposal service directive! the second finnish presidency take place time many say europe crisis, due rejection constitutional treaty two referenda. bi review 83/2006 1 let u put thing perspective. only two year ago ten new country join eu. and four year ago euro note coin replace national currency 12 member states. these remarkable historic achievements. so crisis, crisis? but course, lot work ahead us. our challenge revitalize european economy. we allow current recovery make u forget reform product labour market vital increase growth potential. europe need increase productivity growth good innovation. the integration financial market significant positive effect employment growth. it also reinforce resilience european economy share risk regions. an integrate financial market need modern payment system. therefore, single euro payment area project deserve full support. and need truly unify security market without excessive cost cross-border trading. we therefore remove obstacle consolidation streamlining. our financial supervision structure also fragmented. eu often criticize over-regulation. actually existence 25 different set regulation 25 different administrative supervisory practice bad kind over-regulation. dear friend during war, jean monnet often repeat could peace europe, nation state continue structure around sort sovereignty lead politics national privilege economic protectionism. coincidentally, j.k. paasikivi, post-war president also write war limitation raison d’état question upon hinge future small states, also large states, humanity whole. ultimately, monnet paasikivi talk thing. what essential eu? it guide principle law, force. legitimacy rule law govern relation member states. the task european institution monitor legality compliance activity eu treaties. finally, take account history finland, small country, often shake storm continent, surprise finnish european policy first day

canada, vancouver board trade, vancouver, bc, 13 september 2006. * * * today, i would like talk importance flexibility economic adjustment and, hence, need adopt economic policy promote flexibility market goods, services, capital, labour. i particularly please discuss issue british columbia adjustment change global domestic economic development front centre management economy. first, i explain i mean flexibility. a surely aware, bank canada openly discuss importance promote policy support economic efficiency, include financial system efficiency. efficiency refer allocation scarce economic resource productive uses, cost-effective way. flexibility refer ability economy adjust change circumstances. when economic condition change, typically cause movement relative price send important signal markets. a flexible economy one adjust signal return production potential quickly, little cost, possible. economic flexibility i wish focus today. why flexibility important over past several years, economic expansion canada around world robust. and, look ahead, prospect remain generally upbeat. in respects, witness term economic performance unprecedented, especially since attain face major global country-specific shock that, past, would cause great difficulty threaten derail expansion. this certainly case canada mid-1990s economy hard time deal economic financial shocks. the boom-bust cycle 1970s, 1980s, early 1990s stand clear evidence domestic house order. the final straw extent canadian economy get catch backwash 1994-95 mexican peso crisis high unsustainable level public debt time. indeed, year 1995 prove watershed. by then, bank succeed reduce inflation anchor short-term inflation expectation 2 per cent target. the federal budget deficit begin shrink significantly 1995, 1997/98 fiscal year, move surplus position. other structural policies, include tax reform free trade, also begin pay dividends. canada's economic record past decade stand stark contrast early period. output employment continue grow steadily since mid-1990s, even economy buffet series significant shocks. let recall shocks. they start 1997-98 asian financial crisis, spread russia latin america. this series event emerging-market economy lead sharp decline world demand commodity price and, hence, mark depreciation canadian dollar. next come worldwide collapse high-tech bubble. it, too, depress foreign demand canadian good services, 9/11 terrorist attack unite states. on relatively small scale, since begin century, canadian economy contend domestic calamity also international dimension them. i'm referring, course, sars bse. more recently, face intensify competition major new global players, notably china india. and, since 2003, experience sharp appreciation currency, primarily reflect strong world demand high price energy commodity produce. what key characteristic shocks? bi review 83/2006 1 the asian crisis 1997-98 circumstance experience since 2003 involve large movement relative prices. by i mean sharp movement price energy non-energy commodity (relative price good produce) exchange rate canadian dollar. these movement trigger important shift economic activity reallocation production resource across sector region economy. follow asian crisis, saw shift commodity manufacturing. now see shift opposite direction. and current intense competition asia clearly evident reduce price manufacture consumer goods. adjust shock easy – indeed, many firm worker downright painful. still, i say earlier, total output employment continue grow good clip past decade - average 3 2 per cent year, respectively. furthermore, current episode mark movement relative prices, broad-based economic growth across canadian regions. canada economy cop good recent shocks. to vary degrees, country well - partly explain world economic growth hold good time around. clearly, many national economy able respond flexibly past unexpected developments. and help mitigate impact shocks, advance adjustment, support continue strong economic performance. this increase flexibility product economic policy structural reform many countries, include canada, undertake year strengthen economy make resilient shocks. but mean nothing worry look ahead. we live era rapid change, operate global environment constantly shifting. uncertainty, risks, shock constant feature economic landscape. for canada, particularly relevant give open economy international trade capital flows. at bank canada, believe world economic prospect remain favourable look medium term. but reflect central expectation world unfold, important upside downside risk around scenario. on downside, persistent global imbalance immediately come mind, lack success doha round trade talks. these risk could result significantly slow global economic growth. at time, cannot rule possibility strong growth, especially asia. of course, know event turn differently expectation today. so must plan accordingly. in term potential risk sudden developments, best approach constantly ask step take make economy domestic market flexible thus good able adapt. and need recognize pursuit approach share responsibility among firms, workers, policy-makers. firm worker need able respond quickly technological advance various shock require significant change way conduct business, type good service produce, market choose develop. a well-functioning market-based economy clear relative price signal critical context. at time, policy-makers need wary barrier adjustment, labour regulation inhibit movement worker one type job, one sector region, another. some issue particularly relevant canadian context, i return later. the key point i want make economic policy structural reform enhance flexibility make easy withstand shock make adjustments. and help maintain output economy's production potential. put differently, strong, well-functioning domestic market goods, services, capital, labour essential economic well-being canadians. in addition, national economy closely connect days, action individual country increase flexibility translate even great cumulative benefit world economy. indeed, great number economy flexible enough adapt change circumstances, strong sustainable world economic growth be. so policy promote flexibility thus position u take advantage opportunity offer globalization cope unforeseen shock sure come way? 2 bi review 83/2006 policy promote economic flexibility in canada – many country – good macroeconomic management instrumental good economic performance recent years. specifically, monetary policy focus low, stable, predictable inflation help canadian business read price signal clearly, respond relative price change promptly, generally allocate production resource efficiently. and this, together bank canada's symmetric response deviation 2 per cent inflation target contribute solid stable economic growth past decade. a float exchange rate - key component monetary policy framework – also provide important stabilization mechanism canadian economy. movement exchange rate provide clear price signal help speed adjustment shock low overall economic cost exchange rate move. with fix exchange rate, take long price signal recognized, adjustment primarily take place change domestic price wages, cost significant variability output employment. it also important recognize simply possible central bank successfully control domestic external value currency time. we one instrument – policy interest rate – one target. thus, inflation target, naturally operate float currency. a sound fiscal policy, focus reduce public sector debt level relative size economy, also contribute significantly economic stabilization. it give government flexibility respond evolve circumstance unexpected developments. they let automatic fiscal stabilizer work help sustain overall level demand economy weak relieve demand pressure economy booming. we also know bitter experience, especially late 1980s, economic outcome good adjustment le costly macroeconomic policy work tandem. in regard, give current strength domestic demand canada high level resource utilization, government need guard add excess demand pressures. despite considerable progress canada elsewhere maintain macroeconomic stability, grow integration world economy make clear enough. to enhance flexibility, raise economy's growth potential, increase resilience shocks, also need structural reforms. for canada, structural reform broad context, many priority across number jurisdictions. i'll mention couple i consider particularly relevant. the financial system, vital role support healthy modern economy, continue top priority. here, ultimate goal innovative, efficient, sound financial system provide specialize finance service competitively. such system enhance overall economic flexibility help redirect capital resource productive uses, cost-effective way, follow shock. remove internal barrier free movement goods, services, labour another priority. this area rightly attract renew attention, difference regional economic performance shortage skilled labour become pronounced, demographic challenge begin intensify. a number initiative remove internal barrier undertake year - mix generally modest results. here, i'm think "red seal" program, introduce 45 year ago help standardize recognize workers' trade qualifications. i'm also think agreement internal trade (ait), sign first minister 1994 aim reduce barrier movement goods, services, investment, labour. more recently, see progress area procurement practices, enforcement dispute resolution, license residency requirement employment. one recent example accord reach past april british columbia alberta strengthen enforcement dispute resolution, harmonize labour credential business regulation standard early 2009. another example agreement, early year, ontario quebec allow further, albeit limited, movement construction worker two provinces. early month, two temporary "foreign-worker units" start operate vancouver bi review 83/2006 3 calgary facilitate entry skilled foreign worker canada. and last week, committee minister responsible internal trade agree action plan embrace effort across range internal trade issues. all encourage considerably need do enhance flexibility function internal market coast coast. business regulation standards, include financial sector, need harmonize across canada. dispute resolution enforcement ait need strengthened. and, make labour market flexible, trade professional designation recognize fully transferable across country. base recent survey, one-third worker half foreign-trained worker still problem get credential recognize across canadian jurisdictions.1 how flexible canadian economy? the good news that, despite challenge still face, overall, economy fare well international comparison flexibility adaptability. in 2005 study, international monetary fund (imf) conclude "canada characterize relatively high degree flexibility, magnitude comparable large many industrialize countries, likely exception unite states."2 for purpose study, imf look different indicator economic flexibility – uniform results. for example, reallocation production resource across sectors, response change economic condition 1980-2000 period, quite high canada compare major industrialize country (except unite states) - indicate high degree economic flexibility. the imf also compare rate firm turnover, job creation destruction, across countries. both measure relatively high canada - suggest high degree flexibility. other measure way economy respond macroeconomic disturbance also point direction. a first quarter 2006, interprovincial migration show mark increase past two year 333,000 individuals, represent one per cent total canadian population. not surprisingly, two province net positive inflow period alberta british columbia. and recent study imf focus canadian labour market conclude that, overall, relatively flexible.3 so canada seem rate high accord measure flexibility. but challenge continue promote flexibility domestic market - goods, services, capital, labour. continuous improvement essential. give openness canadian economy, cannot complacent. recent economic financial development before concluding, let summarize bank's current think economy, lay last week press release announce decision leave target overnight rate unchanged 4 1/4 per cent. basically, note global economy continue expand solidly, moderation u.s. economic growth strengthen rest world. against backdrop, commodity price remain firm. in canada, level economic activity second quarter 2006 somewhat bank's expectations, primarily weak exports. total core cpi inflation come slightly high expect july, mainly price strength house service sectors. nevertheless, thing consider - i would include recent labour

counsel help borrower decide upon quantum loan avail, base income profile stream cash flows. more importantly, ex ante counsel attempt influence stability borrowers’ flow income expenses, thereby low probability default. ex post counsel typically occur crisis event, borrower already miss one several payments. the purpose counsel prevent default foreclosure. it is, therefore, curative nature. credit counsel practice generally tend ex post nature. such counsel involve one-on-one meetings, allow counsellor observe level maintenance debt issue relevant stability borrower's situation. it include advice crisis management, budget also explore avenue network provide succour interim. owe reasons, counsel expensive, owe not-so-insignificant administrative cost involved. a credit counsel agency often receive compensation creditor debt payment distributed. this fund relationship could lead impression credit counsel agency merely collection wing creditors. it therefore essential guard undesirable possibilities. in many instances, nurture borrower back health default time-consuming process, besides cause severe inconvenience distress families. traditional bank technology rely mainly

bahrain monetary agency, arab central bank governors' meet “bahrain's experience single regulator”, algiers, 4 september 2006. * * * fellow governors, excellencies: my remark today focus bahrain’s experience single regulator model. i briefly outline main argument support single regulator model, well argument make it. i describe bahrain’s experience create single regulator, draw conclusion this. first, argument typically encounter debate financial regulatory structures, consider single regulator model? in principle, regulatory structure categorize accord two basic type – essentially focus class financial institution sector - insurance broke bank - base around specific regulatory function objective – investor protection prudential soundness financial sector firms. historically, many jurisdiction operate multiple regulators, reflect way financial sector regulation evolve industrialize world. this evolution typically saw bank supervision become first develop formal manner, usually extension mandate central bank (because stable bank system important run effective payment system monetary policy). insurance security supervision typically develop separately, usually late stage. security regulators, furthermore, tend focus investor protection wide issue systemic stability: many could categorize functional rather sectoral regulators, many case responsibility cut across different class institutions. from late 1980s onwards, however, various jurisdiction start implement new regulatory structure merge regulators, often single body. north european country norway (1986), denmark (1988) sweden (1991) lead way. but move uk japan (both 1998) give major impetus trend. since then, steady stream country change single regulator model. three main argument usually advance support creation integrate regulators. the first sector-based regulator long reflect reality evolve financial market players, blur boundary financial sector see growth ‘cross-sectoral’ groups, conglomerates. a group develop across different sector product types, face problem deal grow number regulators, ostensibly focus different aspect operations, raise risk duplication regulatory underlap. even activity institution group remain limit single sector, may potentially face multiple functional regulators. in short, traditional regulatory structure view increasingly ill-adapted rapidly evolve financial service industry, increase regulatory cost industry heighten risk supervisory failures. the second argument integrate regulator operate efficiently single body – words, achieve economy scale. thus, single regulator reduce cost move single set support services, unify management structure, unify approach rule make supervision. third, argue single regulator achieve economy scope. in words, address cross-sector issue effectively single body, rather multiple regulator – whether term develop rule cross-sector applicability (such corporate governance anti-money laundering), address supervisory concern (e.g. impact fall asset price financial sector firms). a single regulator good reach bi review 81/2006 1 comprehensive view risk face financial sector, respond accordingly – instance, move staff supervise sector risk increasing. what argument single regulator model? some people argue fundamental difference prudential supervision – i.e. ensure institution fail – conduct business regulation – i.e. ensure institution treat customer fairly accordance good market practice applicable regulations. the former tend le rules-based le confrontational – indeed, prudential supervisor often don’t want publicize actions, fear undermine confidence institution. the latter tend legalistic approach, focus simply whether compliance rule achieved, ensure compliance tough enforcement publicity – fines, ‘naming shaming’, on. – combine function single entity thus problematic, argument goes. in view, difference over-emphasised; many jurisdictions, furthermore, recent year evolution supervisory approaches, reduce difference different type regulation. to extent difference remain, also argue good internalize resolve within single institution. other argument single regulator model tend focus institutional factors, many specific particular jurisdictions. it say single regulator powerful – although answer good accountability mechanisms. in countries, create single national regulator difficult, either institutional rivalries, exist body able resist loss responsibility, regional issues. (each usa’s 52 states, instance, retain insurance regulator.) though powerful obstacles, argument don’t much call question rationale single regulator; rather, highlight specific political institutional obstacle may make move difficult, within particular jurisdiction. until year ago, regulatory structure gulf essentially sectoral nature, bahrain exception. bank tend dominate financial sector, primary focus regulation therefore bank sector. in cases, responsibility regulate supervise bank sector rest central banks. the regulatory mandate central bank region also extend beyond banks, cases, cover certain type non-bank institution (such money changer sometimes investment firms); insurance supervision separately regulate commerce ministries, stock market (and broking members) run self-regulatory organizations. in may 2002, government bahrain announce transfer regulatory responsibility insurance sector capital market from, respectively, ministry commerce bahrain stock exchange, bma. this far-reaching reform, create first integrate regulator region, bring together one roof prudential conduct business regulation whole financial sector. in addition, bma retain responsibility central bank systemic stability (including oversight payment system monetary policy), well central bank function currency issue, reserve management provider bank service government departments. in short, scope bma’s responsibility similar monetary authority singapore, otherwise unique single institution gulf region. what reason reforms? the key advantage bahrain move single regulator lie mainly economy scale scope could achieved. for relatively small country ours, impact economy significant. not able save costs, also reduce cost industry create simple easily understand regulatory framework, minimize risk regulatory duplication. we able utilize scarce specialist resources, previously available one regulator, across difference sectors; able apply extensive supervisory experience available bank regulator across sector well. the net result move upgrade quality regulation supervision apply non-banking sectors, time insurance capital market activity fast developing. achieve this, however, take time. combine different regulatory organizations, corporate culture way things, mean much management attention require create new organization. staff need motivate retained, counter unsettle nature change. new system process need put place. 2 bi review 81/2006 also, jurisdiction undertake reforms, new law need put place. in bahrain’s case, pending passage single financial service law, able make progress simple expedient initially issue short amendment exist sector laws, 1987 insurance act – change transfer regulatory responsibility bma. this allow u make start integrate different regulatory organization early on, even though continue operate different law banking, insurance capital markets. the process draft new, integrate financial service law, secure passage parliament recently completed, without approach, implementation single regulator would delay several years. let finish draw together conclusion bahrain’s experience. first, doubt mind single regulator model right approach country like bahrain. i believe allow u build effective efficient regulatory system; allow u spread regulatory best practice across whole financial sector. separate regulator would simply sub-optimal size, case. that say single regulator right model countries. industry specific, institutional factor may mean different approach would work good jurisdictions. second, i would caution expect instant results. it take time put place new laws, create truly integrate organization, common understand regulatory approach processes. four year on, make significant progress direction, i would first admit still work issues. finally, i would underline management challenge involve create new regulator. on-going supervisory work course remains, whilst additional work build new regulator undertake – maintain ‘business usual’ approach require significant commitment staff. these brief remark touch surface issue surround single regulator debate. nonetheless, i hope provide helpful pointer discussion, perhaps encourage consider whether jurisdiction might also benefit move model. thank attention. bi review 81/2006 3 burhanuddin abdullah: monetary exchange rate policy

hemisphere, discus important issue common interest. indeed, theme seminar “monetary exchange rate policy international financial system” timely relevant asian latin american economies. we aware past two decades, two region undergo daunt challenge manage monetary exchange rate, particular deal major external shocks. in spite improve resilience address kind shocks, thank major reform conduct aftermath late 1990s crises, downside risk global economy could dismissed. in fact, globalize integrate financial market, central banker world, notably emerge market confront unprecedented potential challenge arise surge short term capital flows. currently, low interest rate international market concern sustainability u twin deficit drive factor push capital flow emerge markets. at time, high yield domestic currency-denominated instrument emerge market pull factor. a aware, distinct characteristic capital flow pre- post-crisis periods. before crisis, capital inflow mainly associate effort domestic market actor avail foreign source finance international bank loan issuance various global financial instruments. however, since 2003, foreign capital flow mainly drive flush global liquidity search optimum rate return. the difference type capital inevitably entail different consequence emerge markets, corollary monetary exchange rate policy, i briefly elaborate further. policy open capital account date back 1970, indonesia begin seek liberalize capital account. initially, liberalization start removal compulsory surrender export proceeds. by 1982, type capital control dismantle leave capital account virtually open. until asian crisis hit 1997, exist restriction capital inflow apply foreign borrow bank company government-linked project net open foreign exchange position (nop) bank prudential regulation. prior crisis, system contribute sustain high economic growth, thereby promote long term development program. foreign capital inflow also foster deepen domestic financial sector expand market liquidity. however, benefit capital inflows, particular early 1990s, undermine financial market imperfection stem lax regulation supervision moral hazard due implicit guarantees. these problem reflect inefficient allocation capital, unhedged foreign liabilities, inflate asset prices. a market confidence prospect economy emerge market asia faltered, reversal capital outflow could arrested, thereby lead capital account crisis. with hindsight asian crisis, central bank seek strengthen monitor capital movement minimize speculative transactions. to end, 2001 bank indonesia issue regulation non-internationalization rupiah. subsequently, wave capital reversal speculation rupiah trigger rise world oil price heighten 2005, issue series micro policy address imbalance demand supply forex market. furthermore, prudential regulation bank sector also strengthen tight rule nop particular transaction forex trading. bi review 88/2006 1 indonesian float exchange rate regime needle say fellow governor choice exchange rate system depend great extent condition country give time. in current context indonesia, free capital mobility limit amount international reserves, believe float exchange rate system adopt august 14, 1997 optimal choice. the system, believe, provide built-in discipline market whereby infrastructure sufficiently strong. this float part create break imprudent overseas borrowing, market participant factor cost possible movement rupiah. we fully aware case domestic financial market imperfections, thin forex market limit availability hedge instruments, float rate system often lead high volatility adverse consequence stability. therefore, practice adopt float rate system, view smooth exchange rate movement necessary. in fact, measure reduce volatility unique. a posit calvo reinhart, almost country adopt de jure free float rate system rule intervention curb volatility exchange rates. such intervention conduct direct intervention forex market use interest rates. monetary policy framework float exchange rate regime a logical consequence flexible exchange rate system exchange rate long serve monetary policy anchor. during stabilization period imf program, bank indonesia adopt base money anchor. over long run, however, notice number shortcoming use base money operate target, difficulty achieve target poor signal transmit market. such poor signal monetary policy direction target obviously fail meet need maintain market expectation future exchange rate movement. in view factors, bank indonesia adopt fully-fledged inflation target framework july 2005. the framework least consist three primary characteristics. first, monetary policy direct towards achievement inflation target explicitly announce public specify time horizon. in regard, new central bank law inflation target set government. second, monetary policy must implement forward-looking basis, respond future development inflation. on operational level, bank indonesia us bi rate policy rate respond future trend inflation. in formulate monetary policy, taylor-type rule use benchmark. thus essence, interest rate use monetary policy instrument adjust manner respond deviation inflation gap output gap. obviously, rule like apply mechanically. a balance rule discretion, constrain discretion, i see it, especially necessary monetary policy must pursue within increasingly globalize complex financial environment. we must always alert market developments, whether money market market goods, number signal indicator reflect domestic global economic developments. we also keep mind inflation sole objective central bank, public also pursue objectives, job creation improvement incomes. for reason, inflation target framework retain fundamental monetary policy paradigm strike optimum balance inflation output. apparently, central bank face dilemma choose inflation growth, inflation remain priority. an example see problem face last year, world oil price almost doubled. this disturb trend become highly problematic monetary policy boost inflationary pressure, also inhibit economic growth. many suggest central bank need respond temporary surge inflation. however, view time despite temporary nature disturbance, inflationary impact emanate high oil price increase price good services, transport wages, would drive core inflation. in situation, tight policy necessary prevent sustain escalation public inflation expectations. the third characteristic itf monetary policy implement transparent basis measure accountability. in view, element like these, inflation target mere framework monetary policy. inflation target promote good governance central bank. by announce inflation target public, central bank commit achievement. 2 bi review 88/2006 uncertainty future inflation ease public inflation expectation point reference, thus economic cost arise uncertainty also reduced. communication public future monetary policy direction also vital public anticipate central bank monetary policy avoid ‘surprises’ could trigger volatility money market. to strengthen policy effectiveness present age disclosure, central bank must also carry process educate public monetary policy objective are, strategy achieve objectives, lie behind decision taken. one example involve communication monetary policy response soar oil price risk global imbalance time weak condition real sector high unemployment. communication central bank market player also necessary, especially financial market experience turbulence. in financial market fraught asymmetric information, wealth information hold central bank frequently great benefit mitigate issue thus prevent panic herd investors. in regard, credibility central bank crucial. conclude remark under environment financial integration, task central bank maintain monetary financial system stability become challenging. to navigate change environment, view central bank least three critical tool discretion. first flexible exchange rate system, provide autonomy monetary policy. second monetary policy framework consistent, credible, transparent provide monetary policy anchor within flexible exchange rate system. third strong bank system capable absorb various risk create financial globalization. the mount risk uncertainty emerge within financial globalization process also underscore importance central bank role guide public expectations. within context, credibility central bank crucial. to end, transparency, accountability, effective communication must integral entire monetary management process. in short, communication may serve additional “instrument” central bank use disposal complement monetary instrument monetary policy operate effectively. thank you. bi review 88/2006 3 eva srejber: great budgetary discipline eu transparency national ownership speech m eva srejber, first deputy governor sverige riksbank, breakfast seminar organise ernst & young, stockholm, 26 september 2006. * * * fiscal monetary policy interdependent. a government need transparent consistent monetary policy know conduct fiscal policy. similarly, monetary policy sustainable rapid accumulation debt. this sweden witness 1980s early 1990s. an unsustainable mix fix exchange rate lax fiscal policy, lead high inflation eventually crisis land u even high mountain debt. when regime collapsed, general council decide riksbank work towards direct inflation target. the riksbank determine target would two per cent. today policy hail success. however, real breakthrough new regime mid-1990s forceful implementation fiscal consolidation, support broad political majority parliament, make macroeconomic set-up whole credible. it inflation expectation among public finally fell target 2 per cent, interest rate spread germany reduce substantially. this fiscal tighten could turn base predictability new monetary regime clear inflation target. and tight fiscal policy would eventually allow le restrictive monetary policy. why budgetary rule need eu level? this interaction fairly well understood, always act upon, national level. but eu level extra dimension. many countries’ fiscal policy match single monetary policy. one possible risk ecb would end bail fiscally undisciplined country unsustainable debt. however, many eu member states’ unwillingness meet stability growth pact show problem arise matter go far full-blown debt crisis. the problem might bias towards fiscal laxity counterbalance tight monetary policy - hence bad policy mix. with single monetary policy effect fiscal stimulus one country dilute whole area therefore definition meet le monetary policy response would monetary policy national. furthermore nature political set-up make difficult ecb comment individual national budgets. this mean strong temptation “free-ride” expand budget expense fellow euro area nations. but dilemma go – give rational others expand budget become rational country – even instinct “free-ride”. otherwise might rationally expect end among small minority expand time still tight monetary policy result everyone else expanding. this classic “prisoner’s dilemma” game theory. the conclusion necessary rule fiscal policy limit deficit debt monetary policy unite fiscal policy divided, rule need follow credible fashion. but, addition, conclusion also temptation over-expand strong upturn downturn. in fact see euro area heyday late 1990s begin 21st century – much expansionary fiscal stance euro area countries, especially good times, lead tight monetary policy ecb thus incentive others weaken fiscal discipline. when downturn eventually came, euro area enter phase large deficit instead surpluses. what pact required, 180-degree turnaround fiscal policy tight stance, reinforce downturn consider stupid. in fact lack save bi review 88/2006 1 boom stupid. thus, rule would need maximum deficit downturn, equally forceful rule fiscal rectitude good times. how pact changed? the fiscal problem encounter country downturn trigger change stability growth pact. in view, change necessary many amendment pact go right direction. however, make framework le predictable. the change consist three parts: good governance, change preventive arm change corrective arm. good governance good governance include good budgetary discipline national level, realistic forecast reliable statistics. national budget complementary member states’ commitment stability growth pact. national institution could play prominent role budgetary surveillance increase attention development public finance public opinion. but apart general words, reform pact spell guideline appropriate development national institutions. within eu begin analyse various form national regulations. i hope continue work lead strong anchor fiscal policy among member states. i return question little later. more realistic forecast consist common assumptions, mainly external developments, stability convergence programmes. the experience first year reform pact indicate lead realistic national growth forecasts. more reliable statistic refer budget data problem range creative account via methodological problem understaffed non-independent statistical compilers. the problem tackle strengthen eurostat allow make methodological visit member states, discus budget issues. a new high level group mandate advise eurostat established. a eurostat monitor member states’ compliance agree practice, high level group also, indirectly, advise member states. my view reform area stability growth pact go right direction since encourage fiscal prudence. however, give complicate process short time since pact changed, early determine whether change complete success. change preventive arm change preventive arm make area medium term objective (mto) budget balance. member state divide group depend debt level. strict mtos require country high debt. the mtos euro area erm2 country range deficit 1% gdp balance surplus depend debt level. the country achieve mtos suppose follow adjustment path objectives. the path require consolidation good times. for euro area erm2 states, adjustment requirement yearly improvement cyclically adjust deficit net one effect 0.5% gdp. this strengthen compare early agreement among euro area countries, change requirement target cyclically adjust deficit target improvement structural deficit. when decide adjustment path, public investment structural reform take account. if structural reform take account, large prove positive effect economy safety margin 3% deficit floor. my view possibility use newly define mtos wise manner, closely adapt situation individual country. however, scope interpretation large high risk lax uneven implementation. the experience first year indicate member state ambitious mtos require pact. this often country national budgetary rules, sweden, comprise mtos. at time, 2 bi review 88/2006 member state need achieve mtos. the measure often postpone far ahead sufficiently explicit concrete. change corrective arm the third part change refer happen country excessive deficit. a before, exemption grant country suffer severe economic downturn could foresee, call exceptional circumstances. the definition severe economic downturn changed, however. accord old agreement, country experience fall gdp 0.75% could exempt edp fall gdp 2% always lead exemption. now gdp requirement change negative growth period low growth relative potential. exemption also continue grant take account relevant factors, condition deficit temporary close reference level. but number relevant factor include judgement whether edp initiate increased. such factor include public investment also potential growth, lisbon agenda achievements, r & d, pension reforms, international solidarity, european policy goals. in opinion, risk pact could interpret differently apply differently different countries. it therefore important closely follow revise pact apply respect. so far, however, exemption grant new pact. the country exceed three per cent limit also assess excessive deficit. if country find excessive deficit, long time frame take effective action correct deficit long timeframe initial deadline correct excessive deficit. normally, timeframe continue 2 year excessive deficit occurred. however, revise stability growth pact allow possibility extend timeframe 3 years. in view, positive change since early system practice mean country month correct excessive deficit, increase respect stability growth pact. however, addition, possibility revise initial deadline introduce create risk excessively prolong edp. to summarise, change stability growth pact thus go right direction might enhance discipline, change introduce flexibility could abused. a always, proof pudding eating. so far, budget plan move strict direction despite fact growth prospect improved. the yearly average deficit euro area stay 2.4% gdp next couple year accord present plans. the structural deficit expect improve marginally 2005 2006 – 2.2 2.1 per cent – despite strong economy. it important stock ready future time low growth. the recovery consolidation eu’s large economy, germany, central importance context. why see problem earlier? the question didn’t see problem stability growth pact beginning? perhaps fortunate something could work temporary replacement rules: clear objectives, strong leadership market quickly react judge. most country want meet convergence criterion thereby join euro area. germany lead way, term economic size example fiscal discipline. now objective join euro achieve many countries, and, addition, germany lose lead role market react le fiscal laxity. instead national leadership towards clear objective see opposite – political exploitation gap national european level. the requirement pact blame heartless “accountants brussels”, majority within country put narrow national political interest first agree rule become moot – “peer pressure” become ”peer protection”. incorrect fact le deliberately send commission ahead sensitive elections. a study barclays capital show year 2000-2003 growth projection overestimate 1.5 percentage point average year euro area countries, lead fiscal balance turn bad expect average 1% gdp per year. in fact, bi review 88/2006 3 study ecb show close country come excessive deficit, likely forecast government present officially late turn wrong. there strong bias towards unrealistic optimism country’s deficit approach 3% gdp. the result indicate study lars jonung martin larch. what challenge future hold? let say something respect new member states. it apparent collapse germany’s lead role fiscal discipline also set bad example large new member states. this despite fact germany appear process correct deficit. give public finance deteriorate much poland, hungary czech republic first year century fortunate euro area country postpone join erm ii attempt rapidly adopt euro. they make clear government finance must order process join euro area begins. have try lock currency within erm ii may well stay position long time, become meantime target speculation – poor public finance would lend little credibility overall economic policy. this sweden’s experience combination currency peg deteriorate public finance 1991-1992. but another danger. give target imminent euro adoption gone, large euro area nation provide real leadership fiscal soundness, le incentive new member state stick consolidation public finances. this especially obvious hungary, deficit 7.5 per cent 2005 is, accord present plans, expect increase around 10% year. for poland czech republic deficit stay present level around 3% come two years. whether old new member states, additional problem, enter period intensify structural changes. old industrial pattern europe change confront boost productivity it globalisation enlargement, support process. these trend eventually help productivity growth europe start catch u again. but short term structural change lead high frictional unemployment old industry rapidly replace new ones. in addition, recent downturn never lead dramatic increase unemployment dramatic decrease employment euro area; hence, upturn probably also le likely lead rapid job creation. both factor create new incentive fiscal policy focus short-term job creation scheme le long-term fiscal soundness. and new member state much different respect. they experience decade incredible structural change, yet ahead. furthermore new member state great infrastructure need and, couple high unemployment, continue pressure fiscal expansion, even cyclical upturn. so perspective, too, hope recovery alone “fix” european deficit problem might optimistic. in addition, structural fiscal deficit many euro area member state might large present calculation show since large risk potential growth low commonly assumed. estimate potential growth old europe successively low labour productivity growth fall gradually last two decade around 2% 1% per year. however, figure second quarter year high see time. the imf’s late potential growth estimate euro area 1.8%. nevertheless, inflation remarkably stable, 2% recent year despite poor growth presume large negative output gaps. if potential growth lower, need fiscal consolidation even high present consolidation programme show. let summarize problem. country large fiscal deficit procyclical policy good time bad times. a commission paper find significant impact election procyclicality, especially procyclical tax cuts. in addition, structural deficit likely high presumed. with low potential growth, ecb need push brake early forcefully people assume. hence, long await help growth fix deficit problem debt-to-gdp ratio likely materialize. deficit debt could 4 bi review 88/2006 deteriorate even pressure age population kick within next five years. be solution? let first note interest development: 1999-2004 average yearly fiscal deficit euro area 1.9 per cent gdp average yearly (unweighted) surplus three old out-countries (the uk, denmark sweden) 1.1 per cent gdp. this despite fact uk move comfortable surplus position deficit 3.3% gdp 2004. some euro-sceptics course attribute difference monetary union i think difference rather three out-countries force find new way build strong national macroeconomic framework base clearly state goal transparent evaluation goal met, addition common eu rules. the part much focus monetary policy regime – sweden uk, inflation target specific target inflation regular transparent inflation forecast work well. but inflation targets, matter denmark’s euro peg, would never successful fiscal policy reform parallel, clear rule budgetary ceiling sweden denmark put problem squarely sight public. consider uk fiscal deterioration last couple years, one might draw conclusion call golden rule, i.e. borrow public investment, clear enough rule, expenditure ceiling target fiscal balance effective. in fact euro area country sort national transparent target evaluation fiscal policy manage retain order public finances; finland prominent example. the power target transparency public, help comment analyst media, evaluate clearly government relation long-term norm. be fiscal policy line target, deviate target? the idea target quite easy grasp, process transparent, expert public alike learn trust figures. in area country still lot do. it pity government accounts, affect everyone society compulsory way, le transparent, le well audit le understand account company list stock exchange, affect people. sweden pre-decided ceiling government expenditure three year ahead target 2 per cent surplus public sector business cycle, figure include pension save that, give age population, fact akin target balance budget cycle. this target present debate every budget. the national institute economic research comment target help public understand it. this keep government accountable normal political sense also relation target agree upon. the political debate sense teach keep long term view. the public know national debate fiscal discipline good country and, “accountants” brussels nation criticise budget policies, great chance criticism interpret help towards fiscal soundness. the swedish trade unions, example, among vocal defender budget target. the expenditure ceiling respect extent help creative accounting. in addition, last couple year decision take ceiling three years, intended. sweden would perhaps need even formal external fiscal evaluation. what conclusions? this lead important conclusion implementation “reformed” stability growth pact eu. perhaps solution regain credibility build – complement european level national framework respective european nation come internalise need balance budget cycle ensure transparency exist fiscal side monetary side. while pressure fellow finance minister apparently work well enough, present attempt national process transparent target good track record. bi review 88/2006 5 why eu country commit establish independent body responsibility enhance transparency conduct independent forecast countries’ deficit provide recommendation regular basis? they would advisory role authority would stem impartiality expertise. the subject recommendation would overall fiscal stance – neither specific indeed political orientation fiscal policy. the protocol excessive deficit procedure (edp) attach treaty state member state shall ensure national procedure budgetary area enable meet obligations. it would therefore spirit treaty eu country commit establish kind bodies. independent forecast would avoid unreliable deficit figure elections, “discover” real state account vote – case portugal, france, germany, hungary spectacularly hungary greece. happily, improvement member state since pact reform march 2005. if similar role congressional budget office us, body would ensure reliable unbiased “reality check” time fiscal profligacy. at best, advisory body would create continuous national dialogue warn recommendation politician would boost transparency put long-term fiscal goal heart debate – reinforce version process help denmark, finland sweden improve fiscal soundness. the experience central bank transparency goal help form expectation behaviour, enlist public struggle macroeconomic soundness. after while, discipline initially seem practically unattainable become almost natural. 6 bi review 88/2006 jean-claude trichet: interview l’espresso an interview mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank, conduct mr claudio lindner, publish 15 september 2006. * * * mr trichet, let u begin examination europe message figure give us: fact see recovery? a early second half 2005 diagnosis euro area experience gradual recovery approach level growth potential. this diagnosis confirm good data second quarter 2006 allow u record good – good forecast – progress first half year. however, word caution: mean change diagnosis trend growth. when rather disappoint figure growth fourth quarter last year say change sentiment trend growth around potential. i would say today flat hard figures. we view everything medium-term perspective. and discount level uncertainty exist world today. not least unite states, contrast, seem experience slowdown. what count u right overall economic situation, global level, therefore unite states. the lead economic institution private research institute state probably continue see rather dynamic growth rate global level. however, seem concern inflation, point many people bet rate rise end year, 3.5%. the primary mandate assign u guarantee price stability, credible order able anchor inflation expectations. this extremely important credibility, also enable favourable level medium long term market interest rate maintained. i convince also sentiment 313 million european citizen (315 include slovenians, next join euro area), ask u safeguard purchase power maintain price stability. therefore, treaty command u also european fellow citizen emphatically ask u do. could inflation trend lead adjust rate again? after last meet frankfurt, i said, behalf govern council, strong vigilance remain essence ensure upside risk price stability contained. do regard 2% inflation limit absolutely inviolable degree flexibility? what keep mind take medium-term perspective. our definition price stability that, medium term, price grow le close 2%. inflationary expectation see various panel tell u that, next five years, inflation see around 1.9%. i believe essential citizens, saver investor trust fact take decision necessary ensure inflation remain level medium term. for three reasons: primary mandate; citizen ask u do, major contribution sustainable growth job creation europe. where see risk price increases? further increase oil commodity price good service price due past oil price increases. also additional unexpected increase administrative price indirect taxes. then, fundamentally, so-called second-round effects, risk increase wage salary would derive loss credibility regard capability counter price increases. it essential intervene effect materialise. do concern include increase vat implement germany january? the increase vat germany, decide upon time ago government, already incorporate analysis. bi review 87/2006 1 you cernobbio, italy, early september. what mood among italian entrepreneurs, politician economists? i saw confirmation great potential italy italian corporate sector, i also find unanimous agreement one important problem face italy insufficient labour productivity consequently rise unit labour costs. it european problem, italian problem, italy particularly visible: implement lisbon agenda aim accelerate productivity growth. but italian industrial structure weak nowadays. what done? research carry italy europe, generally, conclude benefit sufficiently productivity gain sector use new technology (and sector produce technology themselves) seem due overly rigid labour, good service financial markets. structural reform would allow economy make flexible primary tool achieve leap productivity. in unite state make possible mid-1990s. and, consequently? one never underestimate importance investment research development, today insufficient italy euro area whole. you mention structural reforms, currently heart italian political debate development finance laws. let u begin deficit-to–gdp ratio, well 3% limit. be situation italy cause concern you? our message italy, euro area countries, following: benefit high expect economic growth bringing, particular term high tax revenues, allocate entirely reduce public deficit prevent growth debt. that kind recommendation. yes. the position govern council well known. we recommend rigorous compliance stability growth pact. and general rule would suggest first public spend reduced, much possible do area, tax increase necessary order comply stability growth pact. you know tommaso padoa-schioppa well work many year frankfurt. will improve italy’s accounts? tommaso padoa-schioppa one experience persons, within italy europe, also world. he personal influence, personal prestige field money finance, i regard important. of course, clear challenge risk face enormous.” be minister like banker, task responsibility quite different. “tommaso marvellous banker, also hold large number responsibilities. these different tasks, require clear judgement, decision-making ability, strength character determination. let add i forget central bankers, definition, multipartisan responsibility. why? price stability common benefit citizens, regardless political sensitivity individual preferences. accord financial time journalist, absence structural reform italy risk expel euro. be true? italy important economy euro area course definitely risk this. i already say i comment absurd assumptions. exactly like member countries, italy need homework: improve productivity public accounts. one main stumble block negotiation ongoing within government issue pensions. 2 bi review 87/2006 that pension european problem, due age population result pressure public funds. without reform pension systems, contribution rate would need double countries, much 40% salary cases, order keep balance system’s accounts. but do cases? in order tackle consequence age populations, need comprehensive reforms. even unequivocal solutions, measure valid several countries: raise retirement age, eliminate early retirement incentives, reduction replacement rates, integrate public pension within system allow future payment finance age population create imbalance generations. should men woman retire age? this sensitive important issue trigger whole host reaction different point view. apparently, accordance current jurisprudence, i would say retire age, european court justice maintain discrimination distinction men woman area. how urgent pension reform? extremely urgent, euro area countries. when look demographic trends, tend put talk long-term developments. it seem movement slow long, time. however, complete illusion issue tackle early possible. the radical left-wing union oppose say technocrat pay attention numbers. a important international leader, believe also social cost need take consideration? we are, all, talk million people weak category population. it crucial factor. structural reform sort decide upon national government within framework agreement make lisbon forget ultimate objective increase pace economic growth order ensure prosperity provide job everyone, fundamental weak poorest. rather find compromise various member society, cost reap benefits, i see compromise present future. it forward-looking investment good future weak part population entail cost beginning. and case let u forget cannot ask child grandchild pay bills! in europe, population shrink point 2020, accord different studies, 20 million people available work. in unite states, rise. how this? perhaps unite state population entire generation immigrant birth rate higher. and cultural aspect, optimistic us. why? this involve philosophical cultural aspect i convince structural. there also difficult period unite states, example, end 1980s europe upbeat great faith future, build something together. these cyclical phenomenon ecb, together lorenzo bini smaghi, governor banca d’italia, mario draghi, entire govern council, try best ensure europe regain confidence itself. credibility key word ecb. bi review 87/2006 3 y v reddy: foreign exchange reserve – new reality option address dr y v reddy, governor reserve bank india, 2006 program seminar theme "the world asia, asia world", singapore, 18 september 2006. * * * distinguish friends, i thankful organiser invite participate 2006 program seminar theme "the world asia, asia world". the theme session tantalise words: problems, plenty, challenges, opportunities, accumulation, large, foreign, windfall reserves. it may little hard match sense word address central bankers. so, i intend take slightly broad view subject focus new reality innovative ideas. i would argue degree comfort various level reserve give time country-context general, high degree comfort, numerous options. i. new reality forex reserve management (i) large increase: rapid asia in aftermath asian crises, widely perceived, support academic research commentators, large reserve need emerge market economy (emes) withstand crisis and, extent, reflection lack confidence international financial architecture. a result, recent episode reserve accumulation much high scale prolong see early 1990s. for instance, report bank international settlement (bis), emes, 2000 2005, accumulate reserve annual rate u $ 250 billion (or 3.5 per cent annual combine gdp), almost five time high level see early 1990s. the bulk reserve accumulation concentrate asia country like china, korea, india, malaysia taiwan (china) witness large increases, country latin america central europe fairly modest increase reserve period. lately, many oil-exporting country also see large increase reserves. it may useful recognise reserve accumulation, senses, reflect savings-investment balance symptomatic domestic global factors, include self-insurance, concept difficult define. (ii) reserve increases: mostly drive capital account surplus it important identify source reserve accretion late episode. there country like russia reserve build current account surplus. in country like china, korea taiwan, surplus, current capital account, lead accumulation reserves. on hand, country like india, reserve accretion drive capital account surplus due current account surplus, broadly imply capital inflow could normally absorb domestic economy. net capital flow remain much large current account deficit india well latin america central & eastern europe. in case reserve accumulation due large capital flows, may useful distinguish debt non-debt flow also foreign direct investment generally le stable portfolio flows. in fact, stock well flow category would relevant reserve management. while marking-to- market asset liability may difficult, might irrelevant. thus, traditional indicator adequacy reserve base trade, debt monetary indicators, even ‘guidotti rule’ ‘liquidity risk’ rule suggest alan greenspan may help explain adequacy reserves, need supplement with, may describe as, multiple indicator ass adequacy reserve country give juncture. bi review 87/2006 1 (iii) difficulty compute quasi fiscal cost reserve a simple method calculate net cost carry reserve central bank difference interest rate domestic security rate return earn foreign exchange reserve adjust exchange rate change. the magnitude cost, often difficult estimate, vary extent sterilisation yield differentials. these term “quasi-fiscal” cost literature since cost central bank pass sovereign low transfer profits. in country local interest rate well international levels, carry cost could positive, reverse true carry cost could negative. a recent study bi show carry cost negative number country current interest rates. the study state china, instance, one year interest rate june 2006 le half comparable u treasury bond rate. hence central bank earn positive carry. however, argue give inherent cyclical nature interest rates, negative carry cost could reverse period time. moreover, one keep mind hypothetical cost calculation capture capital gain losses. dani rodrik harvard university propose measure social cost reserves, national stand point, equal spread private sector's cost short-term borrow abroad yield central bank earn liquid foreign assets. he estimate cost roughly equivalent one per cent gdp develop country 2004. briefly stated, difficulty calculate precisely quasi-fiscal cost cost account. while assess fiscal cost hold reserves, would worthwhile set benefit country may hold reserves. in country risk analysis rat agency institutions, level reserve generally high weights. moreover, essential keep view hide benefit could accrue country hold reserves, may, inter alia, include: maintain confidence monetary exchange rate policies; enhance capacity intervene foreign exchange markets; limit external vulnerability absorb shock time crisis; provide confidence market external obligation always met; reduce volatility foreign exchange markets. it true beyond point, credit rat reach appropriate investment grade, addition reserve may lead improvement credit rating. it necessary recognise that, case costs, difficulty compute benefit too. (iv) change composition reserve the available data composition official reserve indicate progress towards diversification reserve cautious, surprise give definition reserve term “external asset readily available…..…” define imf. an important objective hold reserve prepare contingencies, range instrument available satisfy need limited. nevertheless, management reserve change quest high return within traditional objectives. to quote mr. philip d. wooldridge bis, late article “the change composition official reserves” september 2006 issue bi quarterly review: “continuing trend begin 1970s, reserve first reallocate u treasury bill bank deposits, reserve manager gradually shift higher-yielding, higher-risk instruments. they seem comfortable manage market risk begin take credit liquidity risk too. the currency composition portfolios, volatile, change much instrument composition." it essential recognise reserve manager already shift higher-yielding instrument high risk-return equation, presumably result progressively rise level reserves. consequently, financial return free reserve margin could far high average return. in view, marginal return appear relevant concept context alternative form investment reserves. (v) quasi reserve with positive shock emanate large capital flow result significant reserve accumulation many emes, new development reserve management hold part reserve could use public sector country manner different strictly define pattern hold external asset monetary authorities. such foreign exchange 2 bi review 87/2006 reserve could term quasi reserves. in term holding, quasi reserve could easily retrievable situation demands. in singapore, monetary authority singapore (mas) government singapore investment corporation (gic) basically manage foreign exchange reserves. gic government’s principal investment agent, handle bulk nation’s investment ma hold reserve maintain stability singapore dollar. similarly, temasek hold invest singapore well manage diversify global portfolio aim create maximise sustainable value shareholder provide resource finance pension benefits. on pattern singapore's gic, south korea recently establish korean investment corporation (kic). another interest example china, foreign exchange reserve utilise strengthen bank system without foreign security sold. china transfer fund international reserves, hold peoples’ bank china (pbc) new company, central huijin investment company (chic), set 2003 jointly manage government, pbc state administration foreign exchange. in pbc's balance sheet, say amount reserve replace claim chic. the chic use asset purchase share bank recapitalised. (vi) stabilisation fund investment fund sometimes create public sector "windfall revenue" accrue country due rise export price of, say, oil commodities. such reserve arise due positive external shock cause surge government revenue and, times, could challenge government may deal appreciate exchange rate, undermine export competitiveness symptom "dutch disease". many country chile, kuwait, norway, russia unite arab emirate (uae) institutionalise investment surplus arise positive shock commodity oil price create sophisticate investment agency commodity/oil stabilisation fund manage reserve – since broad range investment opportunity save today 1970s 1980s. the management corpus may, cases, entrust central bank appropriate mandate. usually, stabilisation fund establish one follow objectives: insulate budget economy excess volatility revenues; help monetary authority sterilise unwanted liquidity; build save future generations; use money economic social development. in regard oil funds, transparency disclosure standard appear low official reserve accountability. an interest question regard extent windfall revenue equate large capital flows. while could deceleration windfall revenues, reserve accumulation due large capital flow reckon possibility potential reversal outflow respect capital account. ii. innovative idea it useful explore innovative idea put forward recent period use reserves. first, march 2006, prof. lawrence summer deliver l. k. jha memorial lecture mumbai, argue level reserve many country far exceed traditional measure reserve level require guard foreign exchange crisis. while express concern risk composition asset reserve invested, prof. summer suggest time international monetary fund (imf) world bank think could contribute deployment reserve hold major emerge markets. prof. summer suggest creation international facility two multilateral institutions, country could invest excess reserve without take domestic political responsibility process investment decision ultimate outcome. in turn, modest fee charge two institution could support concessional grant aspect global development. the proposal provide option country hold reserve place part imf/world bank entity operate, de facto, external asset managers. the option could exercised, presume would permissible, obligatory, make placement part reserve envisage entity could assure expertise function bi review 87/2006 3 external asset manager provide high risk-weighted return domestic reserve managers. further, since external asset manager reserve management market usually guide parameter fix official reserve management authorities, may vary country country, propose entity may also several window cater vary mix safety, liquidity return prefer various client countries. thus, critical issue would professional expertise propose entity term assure acceptable risk-reward equation. second, proposal 2005 eswar prasad raghuram rajan imf control approach capital account liberalisation economy experience large capital inflows. the proposal essentially involve securitising portion capital inflow closed-ended mutual fund issue share domestic currency, use proceed purchase foreign exchange central bank invest foreign exchange acquired, abroad. it argue arrangement would eliminate fiscal cost sterilise inflows, provide domestic investor opportunity international portfolio diversification stimulate development domestic financial markets; importantly, would allow central bank control both, time quantity capital outflows. it advocate proposal could part broad toolkit measure liberalise capital account cautiously external circumstance favourable. the merit proposal combine three element – capital account management, financial sector development use foreign exchange reserves. this proposal, set closed-ended private-sector foreign- asset funds, license central bank, appear relevant certain circumstances, mainly likelihood significant investor interest fund. this, however, seem realisable, negative carry fund could entail. further, certain whether private intermediary license central bank specifically purpose would entirely obviate moral hazard, even absence explicit implicit guarantee regard performance. in india, domestic mutual fund permit invest foreign securities, apart adr/gdr indian companies, aggregate limit usd two billion. in addition, limit number qualify mutual fund also permit invest cumulatively usd one billion overseas exchange trade fund (etf). more generally, pace sequence several measure liberalisation capital account take account degree comfort one relevant factors. third, idea receive attention march 2002 gather ‘finance development’ monterrey, mexico, instead hold reserve u dollars, new form global money, akin imf's special draw rights, namely, ‘global greenbacks’ could issued, country could hold reserves. the corpus would create country set aside part reserve every year insurance contingencies. the amount money hold country ‘global greenbacks’ could give develop country finance development programme well global public good like environmental projects, health initiatives, humanitarian assistance, on. for country receive le amount need put reserves, new ‘global money’ would go reserve free dollar country would otherwise set aside. country receive must put reserves, could exchange new money conventional currencies. eventually, new money find way reserves, effect represent commitment country help time trouble. it argue global greenback proposal envisage flow fund poor country accord need contribute global economic growth, stability equity. opponent move argue country become “greenback addicts”, handout end, economic withdrawal symptom severe. fourth, aftermath asian financial crisis, two relate development take place. in year 2000, asean+3 country mutually agree form network bilateral swap agreement provide mutual protection financial emergencies, popularly know chiang mai initiative (cmi). the success initiative reflect recent proposal asian finance minister double size asian central bank swap cmi. the asian bond fund initiative also launch 2003 reflect effort develop regional bond market cater medium- long-term finance need asian economies. the asian bond fund provide arrangement pool portion foreign exchange reserve east asia pacific country fund’s portfolio invest liquid u dollar denominate bond issue major asian economies. the second abf, launch june 2005, 4 bi review 87/2006 aim promote local currency bond markets, establish pan-asian bond index fund (paif) eight single-market fund (smfs). iii. degree comfort the concept adequacy reserve popular also possible, practitioner's perspective, view reserve term degree comfort provide various levels. such perspective dynamic contextual. certainly, low level reserves, india early 1990s, degree comfort low, rise level reserves, comfort also increases. the level comfort discomfort could link problem plenty problem paucity – continuum represent different level comfort various level reserves. for country, could happen initially degree comfort level reserve may low sometime rise level reserves, country might reach 'comfort zone', reserve level keep rise reach still high level, point, portion reserve would cease strictly ‘foreign exchange reserves’ could characterise corpus fund available deployment high risk-return portfolio. several factors, apart exchange rate regime, influence comfort level regard reserves. illustratively, would include vulnerability real sector shocks, strength fiscal financial sectors, current account balance, change composition capital flows, medium-term view growth prospect encompass business cycles, etc. in sense, official reserve reflect balance comfort factor relative external asset liability context rational balance sheet approach. iv. option link comfort let link availability option degree comfort. first, may useful, practical purposes, view adequacy reserve term degree comfort offer give time. second, consider level reserve comfort derive from, necessary take account investment stabilisation funds, applicable. further, transferability official reserve fund vice versa, extent liquidity required, also need consider assess comfort level. third, relative emphasis safety, liquidity return keep change degree comfort give level reserves. fourth, must note national balance sheet point view, official reserve reflect potential market infirmity private sector. so, high return derive high risk assume due large risk appetite external asset managers, deploy official reserve high-risk asset would exacerbate risks. official reserve may need cushion market get suddenly risk averse hence, safety liquidity normally high order priority management reserves. fifth, possible central bank tranche – tranche reflect different combination safety, liquidity return. each tranche manage central bank external asset manager, both, parallel, benchmark relative performance. finally, all, criticality accountability use reserve must recognised. it useful note reserve management policy normally involve joint responsibility government central bank – irrespective whose balance sheet appear. v. conclude observation i would like recall i say regard in 2003, annual fund-bank meet dubai: "the reserve accumulation could also see context availability abundant international liquidity follow ease monetary policy industrial countries. the resultant excess liquidity flow emerge bi review 87/2006 5 markets. in event harden interest rate industrialise countries, liquidity may quickly dry up; situation, emerge market sufficient cushion withstand reverse flow capital." now, global rise interest rates, always lurk fear emes, level capital flow may maintained. thus, comfort level reserve view respect current situation alone also reckon assessment emerge risks. moreover, moment, global economy test eventuality not-so-orderly correction current global imbalances. in eventuality, expert caution, disruption financial market form large cross-currency volatility sharp rise interest rate unlikely global economy. to sum up, several factor impinge comfort level reserve relative weight assign safety, liquidity return. when, search high return pursued, depend upon level comfort, matter convenience context, options, appropriate, always keep open. thank you. 6 bi review 87/2006 irma rosenberg: monetary policy sweden speech m irma rosenberg, deputy governor sverige riksbank, swedbank, stockholm, 18 september 2006. * * * thank invitation come speak. the topic conference economic prospect i course provide view these. however, i speak fairly general term – detail analysis present riksbank’s inflation report, publish end october. before i move onto economic developments, however, i would like take opportunity say word monetary policy conduct sweden general, monetary policy strategy, usually called. more specifically, i intend take question arise discussion medium elsewhere still seem confusion. this apply particular objective monetary policy. do attach le importance inflation target now, even introduce objective addition inflation target? let emphasise right change made. our focus inflation target central aim anchor inflation expectation economy around target. however, formulate monetary policy also give consideration way rest economy developing. it reason i intend begin with. the inflation target consideration real economy the riksbank statutory objective maintain low stable inflation rate, “maintaining price stability” express sverige riksbank act. we specify task ensure cpi inflation around 2 per cent year, tolerate deviation interval +/- 1 one percentage point. a long confidence inflation target threaten – or, usually expressed, long nominal anchor set price wage risk – also opportunity take consideration real economy, production employment, develops. although latter write act, state preliminary work new sverige riksbank act come force 1999 natural riksbank support economic policy objective sustainable growth high employment without neglect long-term price stability objective. this consider natural consequence riksbank authority riksdag (the swedish parliament). it therefore consider unnecessary specify objective price stability law text. there probably also fear statutory objective real economy could give wrong impression – monetary policy could also govern long-term development growth employment, example. it widely accept determine factor directly affect monetary policy, rate technological advance efficient function various markets. in general terms, one say policy conduct riksbank aim partly limit inevitable deviation inflation target partly ensure real economy fluctuate excessively. the objective monetary policy price stability, riksbank also consider real economy consideration important. this characteristic know flexible inflation targeting, far i know, conduct central bank inflation targets. monetary policy affect economy certain time lag. monetary policy decision must therefore base forecast future inflation. normally, monetary policy aim achieve inflation target within two year avoid deviation target large protracted. this two-year horizon regard restriction riksbank place upon mean uphold confidence inflation target. at time, provide opportunity show consideration real economy. if, instance, shock lead inflation push upwards despite weak demand, rapid return inflation target would entail large negative effect real economy – even great slowdown already weak demand – recovery allow occur slow pace. if inflation instead hold back despite good bi review 87/2006 1 growth demand, attempt quickly return target expansionary monetary policy could lead economy overheating. over time policy quickly subdue inflationary impulse would perhaps result stable inflation, would substantial fluctuation real economy. we choose two-year horizon monetary policy consider give sufficient scope case ensure acceptable development real economy. however, rate desirable bring inflation back target depend shock economy suffer substantial are. sometimes deviation target may substantial reason allow inflation return target beyond normal two-year horizon case explain reason announce decision. however, ambition remain same; is, desire ensure inflation low stable year ahead, give consideration stability real economy. what significance house price household indebtedness have? how development house price household indebtedness come picture? house price must give consideration forecast affect, wealth effects, households’ decision regard consumption saving. the size household debt important way interest rate change affect consumption. however, one problem difficult normal forecast analysis work capture risk ensue large fluctuation house price asset prices. one reason model usually use make forecast sophisticate description financial sector interplay real economy. the problem particularly great house price credit growth long period develop manner sustainable long term. it simply possible, analysis forecast tool currently available, forecast sufficient accuracy whether, instance, sudden correction house prices, whether calmer, protract adjustment. at time, riksbank must take account risk conduct monetary policy. if rate increase house price household debt remain high level long period time, risk increase imbalance build force adjustment late on, could bad case significant consequence real economy inflation. the way riksbank manage type risk make monetary policy decision is, principle, make change interest rate sooner late would otherwise assess appropriate timing, give “normal” forecast inflation real economy. it hop policy contribute smooth adjustment process house price help avoid abrupt correction. one example type reason apply monetary policy meet february. we choose raise interest rate 0.25 percentage points, also line market expectations, despite fact forecast inflation path show rate low edge target margin two year ahead, low majority forecast period. the inflation forecast could therefore warrant delay month raise rate. it important realise type decision preventive interest rate change mean inflation target “downgraded” special target house prices. the reason believe best way safeguard set safeguard – stable price avoid large fluctuation real economy. i understand consider type consideration mean monetary policy become “discretionary”. this course true extent. however, time i find difficult see act different way now, far i know first time since introduce inflation target, experience period house price household indebtedness develop way raise concern monetary policy expansionary. the important thing riksbank situation report motif decision make clearly possible. however, consideration difficult make always possible provide simple, precise explanations. one might say, somewhat provocatively perhaps, appear though many interpret objective maintain price stability, generally, safeguard confidence inflation 2 bi review 87/2006 target mean riksbank conduct policy inflation forecast always show inflation target two year ahead. however, overly narrow interpretation i convince follow principle situation final result, see long period time, would bad policy also give consideration prevail circumstances. in context also observe that, despite debate monetary policy become le clear risk confidence inflation target weaken, none reflect inflation expectations. these remain firmly anchor around 2 per cent. much reason riksbank’s monetary policy strategy describe booklet entitle “monetary policy sweden”, publish month ago1. the important aim booklet explain riksbank, set interest rate, scope take consideration development inflation real economy. one step direction take already back 1999 clarification monetary policy publish executive board purpose explain riksbank conduct flexible inflation targeting2. in period since 1999 learn even flexible inflation target conducted. there also considerable progress academic research subject. new insight lead decision issue new document monetary policy strategy. this essentially question development change method describe communicate inflation target policy rather basic strategy itself. inflation focus, interest rate let conclude section speech word concept use discussion monetary policy recently, namely riksbank begin “normalisation” repo rate. the way term ”normalise” use context usually mean policy rate increase low period, is, simply way point natural direction policy rate future. at time, implication term “normalise” level policy rate normally be. some analyst appear interpret mean riksbank’s increase repo rate point reflect end achieve "normal" level economic upturn well establish curve point upwards, quite regardless inflation may develop. however, way reason. the fact interest rate "normal" level reason increase rate, even real economic development favourable. it argument stand itself. the decisive factor future interest rate result forecast assessment inflation economic development whole. it may case, instance, different factor expect hold back inflation relatively long period time may thus reason, even economic boom, allow interest rate “normalise” – use term – slow rate would otherwise justified. in recent year weak growth import price rapid productivity growth factors. on hand, may also case, inflation high hold special factor fairly long period time, interest rate must maintain high level even economic activity strong. this mean also difficult practice determine "normal” level policy rate. it possible use different method calculate approximate interval regard normal repo rate. however, type interval necessity fairly broad – box june inflation report estimate 3.5-5 per cent. experience also show repo rate fall outside rather broad range fairly long period time. give this, observe estimate normal level repo rate fairly limit value assess interest rate development near future interest rate decision cannot justify merely repo rate deviate level regard normal. 1 see monetary policy sweden”, sverige riksbank, 2006 (can download file riksbank's website, www.riksbank.com, order booklet form). 2 memorandum “riksbankens inflationsmål – förtydligande och utvärdering”, 4 february 1999, registration no. 1999-00351 dir, heikensten, l., “the riksbank’s inflation target – clarification evaluation” sverige riksbank quarterly review no. 1, 1999. bi review 87/2006 3 ultimately, inflation forecast relation target decide monetary policy. how quickly target attain also decide development rest economy. the economic situation let go say something monetary policy situation prospect inflation economic activity. it inflation assessment base decision raise repo rate 0.25 percentage point recent monetary policy meet 29 august i intend discuss. an account discussion hold meet contain separate minute publish last week. we observe inflation report publish june economic activity sweden strengthened, largely strong international developments, high productivity expansionary monetary policy. our assessment factor would also continue stimulate economy. gdp growth year therefore expect high, support national account figure first quarter economic indicator development second quarter. there also signal labour market economic activity continue improve, increase demand labour. we could also note inflation begin increase, strikingly low. the high inflation rate partly explain rise energy prices, price certain good also raise quickly before. our assessment inflation would change much come year would gradually increase economic activity improve rise rate wage increase. our forecast inflation would target couple year ahead, assumption monetary policy gradually become le expansionary line market expectation june. international statistic receive summer indicate economic prospect look favourable assume june. the signal regard u economy mixed, however, indicate growth weak expect next year. however, picture euro area part world development slightly strong assume early forecasts. with regard swedish economy, national account second quarter confirm assessment june growth would remain strong. the statistic show gdp growth second quarter actually high forecast. however, development number hour work number person employ weak expected, reflect fact productivity growth much high anticipated. the new indicator receive point continue stable economic activity improvement labour market future. all all, indicate growth high assume june, even take account fact expectation repo rate increase adjust upwards summer. the upward revision growth prospect lead major revision inflation assessment. although high gdp growth indicate inflation may rise rapidly future, strong productivity growth time expect contribute cost pressure low year assume june. cost development somewhat long term difficult assess. if productivity continue develop strongly, company may postpone recruit new staff, would mean delay labour market upturn continue low cost pressures. however, number indication labour market strengthen rapid increase employment probably contribute rise cost pressure future. during summer inflation slightly high expected, mainly due rise energy prices. the inflationary impulse entail extent counteract low unit labour costs, inflation year probably slightly high assume june forecast. our assessment effect energy price subside begin 2007. however, productivity growth, risk underestimate effect – could mean energy price may continue rise could contagion effect push inflation ahead. during 2007 rise unit labour cost provide increase contribution inflation couple year ahead underlie inflation expect line target, give gradual increase repo rate. prospect economic activity inflation thus indicate le expansionary monetary policy call future. this ensure inflation close target development real 4 bi review 87/2006 economy balanced. give this, chose, line repo rate path expect market, raise repo rate 0.25 percentage point monetary policy meet august. the assessment prospect economic activity inflation come year make show would reasonable also assume gradual repo rate increase need continue. i see reason change assessment today. thank you. bi review 87/2006 5 callum mccarthy: the challenge basel ii regulator speech mr callum mccarthy, chairman financial service authority, institute independent business (iib) singapore meeting, singapore, 18 september 2006. * * * i delight ask speak meeting, congratulate iib establish audience far away home base new york. it challenge think uk regulator supervisor say us-based audience singapore – express mutual sympathy effect jet lag. i choose talk briefly select aspect basel ii – subject current raise interest issue international cooperation, subject i've address previous iib meetings. there is, course, continuity previous remark interest issue responsibility home host regulator implementation basel ii. the implementation basel ii represent real, practical important test regulator round world succeed work together. and i afraid result mix rather unambiguously good. this morning i want examine issues, extent collectively succeed resolve them. i make clear start i recognise different regulator operate different legislative frameworks, different political contexts. i always strike enormous difference strong political interest basel ii show u fact political issue uk. and, british political (non) stand basel ii repeat eu country (there political interest germany italy), generalisation clear political interest basel ii europe pale shadow show us. the obvious effect time implementation basel ii, strike difference eu implementation capital requirement directive (crd) little 3 month simple approach 1 january 2008 advance approaches, u timetable 1 january 2009 - first possible date bank could start use advance approaches, subject capital floors. these difference time present significant but, definition since time differences, transient problem international firm bank substantial operation jurisdiction adopt different timetable implementation – particularly obviously eu bank substantial u operations. there extra complexity, diversion management attention, costs. the consolation, exists, time problem temporary, time settled. of serious impact – transient – question bank regulator supervisor different jurisdictions, converge timetable implementation, converge interpretation basel ii predictable and, ideal world, consistent. i want set area make progress towards end, also area still need make progress. within eu, set explicitly responsibility home host supervisor exercise respect model approval, irb ama model application – is, model credit operational risk. the principle lay article 129 crd, establish responsibility home supervisor take decision model approval. it require home supervisor consider view host supervisor model approval, establish right home supervisor take decision agreement cannot reach within six months. this principle flesh work carry committee european bank supervisor (cebs), agree detail guideline home host supervisor cooperate, exchange information; practicality irb ama model validation. both set guideline respect primacy home regulator, impose duty well right upon home regulator. for home host responsibility extend outside eu, position le clear cut. in uk, intention that, possible, bank maintain two set capital calculation business. this mean that, uk supervise bank group activity jurisdiction basel ii introduced, start presumption bi review 87/2006 1 fsa interpretation must apply throughout group. instead, seek incorporate group assessment judgment regulator jurisdictions, provide scale group's activity jurisdiction large policy would irresponsible; provide confidence regulator jurisdictions. i would expect condition normally satisfied. that position time difference eliminated. for period implementation timetable differ, position follows. the differ implementation timetable eu, u jurisdiction materially hamper bank's ability use advance approach uk 2008. thus uk group able include advance approach u operation waiver application. likewise, uk firm part u bank group apply use advance approach uk, even though home regulator approve approaches. since basel i crd-equivalent respect credit risk, always give result least amount require directive, able allow uk group include requirement u bank subsidiary calculate exist u rule period 1 january 2008 u basel ii implementation. we however deem equivalent scaled-up credit risk requirement crd-equivalent u subsidiary question fall 'well capitalize bank' category. i think succeed establish sensible, pragmatic workable arrangement pillar 1 requirement model validation. pillar 2 question likely prove difficult. pillar 2 conceive one size fit measure. it design formulaic prescriptive. it therefore quite possible that, seek address similar risk capture pillar 1, application pillar 2 two similar bank two different jurisdiction could easily produce two different outcomes. it crucial therefore supervisor firm share common understand key characteristic underpin pillar 2. in europe, cebs seek exactly develop guideline set common understand supervisory review process pillar 2 seek achieve. but recognise much common understand comprise recognition, rather elimination, differences. we understand good different decision different eu regulator supervisor take – bank face potential frustration fact result different decision different supervisors. it area predictable sensitivity. but simply matter resolve 'big ticket' home/host issues. banks' chief risk officer equally concern differ interpretation key concept definition use different jurisdictions. perhaps prominent relate divergent approach definition default emerge u jurisdictions. this predictable area sensitivity. the accord implementation group (aig) nick le pan's chairmanship grapple issues, success, notably context home-host information share cooperation. but important continue work issues, particularly trans-atlantic basis. eu supervisors, subject common discipline crd, necessity succeed forge many eu-wide element convergence. the important task aig – arguably basel committee – develop global convergence. i delight – relieve – chairman basel committee fellow panellist morning, nout wellink dnb, whose experience skill clearly fit important difficult set challenges. i hope give bank aware issue comfort learn regulator supervisor share concern, work develop solutions. 2 bi review 87/2006 y v reddy: asian perspective growth – outlook india address dr y v reddy, governor reserve bank india, g30's international bank seminar, host monetary authority singapore, singapore, 18 september 2006. * * * distinguish friends, i delight g30's international bank seminar host monetary authority singapore. indeed, honour privilege amidst global guru financial world. i divide humble presentation five parts: namely contour indian economy; major challenge face indian economy; impact global imbalance india; easily quantifiable strength india and; india's grow economic relation asia. contour indian economy • the indian economy grow average annual growth rate nearly 6 per cent since 1980s, 8 per cent last three years. a draft approach paper eleventh five year plan (2007-08 2011-12) suggest economy grow 8 9 per cent per year. • india also show considerable resilience recent year avoid adverse contagion impact several shocks. • the inflation rate low stable since mid-1990s moderate around 5 per cent per annum. the common intention government reserve bank india maintain annual inflation 5 per cent medium term. • we see consistent increase gross

saving. • the productivity capital use, measure incremental capital output ratio (icor), high asian standard show downward trend reflect improvement productivity growth well intensive use exist capacity. this point prospect sustain high growth future, give exist level investment economy, couple upward trend domestic savings. • a noteworthy development recent year continue recovery manufacture sector. this support domestic well export demand, increase capacity utilization, augmentation capacity improvement private business consumer confidence. • the service sector account 60 per cent gdp grow 9 per cent per annum since mid-1990s, potential create job generate additional income. • there significant decline poverty ratio 1990s reflect late survey 2004-05 national sample survey organisation. the growth performance potential augur well address concern relate disguise unemployment, seasonal unemployment underemployment year ahead. • the fiscal position government, central states, undergo consolidation term target reduction fiscal deficit indicators. • the current account deficit (cad) gdp ratio moderate india. the current account remain surplus 2001-02 2003-04, turn modest deficit since then. it expect continue range 2 3 per cent project outlook 8 9 per cent growth rate eleventh five year plan. india's foreign exchange reserve stand roughly u $ 165 billion well excess total external debt country. bi review 86/2006 1 • the financial markets, especially money, government security forex market nurture develop view critical role transmission mechanism monetary policy. • the financial sector acquire great strength, efficiency stability combine effect competition, regulatory measures, policy environment motivation among market player include banks. • the worker enjoy considerable freedom movement, expression rights, especially unionisation which, make change difficult, ensure vibrancy timely improvisation deal competition. major challenge sustenance indian growth process • first, poor state physical infrastructure, term quantity quality. the important issue regulatory framework address government. technological development rapid enhancement domestic construction capability aid process speedy efficient implementation. give healthy fundamental domestic financial sector enhance interest foreign investors, fund pose serious problem. one concern cost recovery, expect improve public-private partnership. there grind optimism medium term resolution issues. • second, fiscal consolidation. the recent budget central government bring

recognize two important area result fiscal empowerment. one elimination subsidy appropriate, elimination tax exemptions, distortionary. while polity fiscal consolidation hard, particularly setting, grind optimism. • third, perhaps challenge issue relate development agriculture. while 60 per cent workforce dependent agriculture, gdp growth generate agriculture marginally rate growth population, adequate ensure rapid poverty reduction. to facilitate rapid growth agriculture, legislative, institutional attitudinal change supplement enhance public private investment needed. there increase recognition issue among policy makers. • fourth, need shift emphasis attract foreign direct investment, le volatile. this require favourable investment climate general domestic foreign capital. • fifth, delivery essential public service education health large part population major institutional challenge. it strongly felt education empower poor participate growth process large gap availability health term minimum access poor need filled. • with rapid growth manufacture services, sudden intense pressure develop regard availability quality urban infrastructure urban services. a notable begin make direction launch "national urban renewal mission". implication global imbalance india • india contribute either positively negatively term large current account surplus large current account deficit; saving-investments large balanced; economy domestic demand drive generally policies, include exchange rate market oriented. thus, india follow policy serve well also contribute global stability. 2 bi review 86/2006 • any large rapid adjustment major currency relate interest rate current account trade partner would impact indian economy though impact india may le many emerge market economies. • india depend international capital market finance fiscal deficit consequently extent adverse consequence global development would muted. however, could spill-over effect global development domestic interest rate thus fisc also. • any abrupt adjustment global imbalance may impact corporates, bank household india though exposures, aggregate, external sector huge. with respect

risky asset severely restrict reserve bank’s regulatory actions, reversal capital flows, asset price may decline. further, bank india invest significantly government debt fix income securities. if rise international rate get reflect domestic interest rates, bank mark value investment portfolio. however, bank sector acquire add strength absorb probable shocks, largely aid regulatory actions. • a regard impact households, risk rise interest rate general could impact house market expose balance sheet household interest rate risk, increase risk loan loss banks. the overall bank sector’s exposure house loan relatively small, adverse development may systemic implication bank sector. not easily quantifiable strength • first, vast pool science technology graduate million familiar english language

conclude mr. edward luce financial time india say india late book "inspite gods: the rise modern india" "india autopilot greatness. but would take incompetent pilot crash plane" economic relation asia • china india help global economy produce low-cost good service also rapidly grow market right, huge demand consumer capital good produce world. in context on-going buoyancy asian region increase

bi review 86/2006 goh chok tong: opportunity new asia – china, india asean in-between speech mr goh chok tong, senior minister chairman monetary authority singapore, institute international finance (iif) open dinner, singapore, 16 september 2006. * * * let bid warm welcome singapore. i hope stay intellectually stimulate professionally beneficial also enjoyable memorable. the imf world bank meet last hold asia september 1997. a month meet hong kong, asian financial crisis start erupt. the crisis sweep across region, cause immeasurable damage. pundit declare end east asian growth miracle. but asia bounce back. look east asia post-crisis lens, 2001 world bank report "rethinking east asian miracle" note asia still: "...the excite development experience available us...the crisis tarnish record slightly and, anything, together strong recovery several countries, may reinforce conclusion something special countries." indeed, something special asia. asia problems, face big challenge ahead. but never human history world see large-scale reduction poverty rise live standard billion short time. i therefore confident asia's prospects. over next 20 years, asia continue surge, lead re-emergence india china, revitalise asean. japan, remain important player asia. however, mature economy, japan expect grow fast india china. this evening, i focus india, china asean in-between. india march first, india. prime minister manmohan singh say india's independence day year india "certainly march". the prime minister modest man give exaggeration. today, india attract attention foreign investor world leader alike. over past 12 years, india grow average 6.5% per year. growth even higher, 8% per annum, last three years. i believe india continue grow fast pace two main reasons. first, india, old mindset toss aside favour pragmatic policy support reform liberalisation, integration global economy. india's market reform stay course despite several change government prime ministers. business leaders, too, prepare compete foreign company foreign investor india. early year, i meet chief minister west bengal kolkata. the state communist rule 30 years. the chief minister, one politburo member communist party india (marxist), keen foreign investments. he tell candidly look "the colour investment - yellow, red white". this remind deng xiaoping's famous dictum: colour cat matter le ability catch mice. the indian communist draw lesson fate communist regime - fall soviet union rise china. they know perform perish. i believe reform india irreversible, even though pace may fluctuate. no matter party come power, government day perform perish. the indian voter bi review 86/2006 1 see china, poor, raise standard live people. and want government them. second, india many

86/2006 jean-pierre roth: switzerland singapore - small country platform global business keynote address mr jean-pierre roth, chairman govern board swiss national bank chairman board director bank international settlements, swiss business association, singapore, 18 september 2006. * * * once while, annual meet international monetary fund world bank take place washington, usual, hold somewhere else world. the fact meet singapore time welcome opportunity return "city lion". i happy today i would like thank swiss business association ambassador woker host association lunch. for swiss people, always pleasure – even delight – spend time fascinate city. since singapore often refer "switzerland asia" particularly interest make comparison home country. a matter fact, i one 50,000 swiss visit singapore year.1 singapore unique place beautiful skyline, outstanding location, pulsate life, – – openness world. interestingly, singapore switzerland share many common features. in particular, country deal surround neighbour much large powerful. some believe must make hard succeed competition kind, fact opposite true. let show position disadvantage, but, contrary, asset. clichés hard overcome. in case switzerland, know, best know banks, watches, chocolate cheese. other this, despite strong presence swiss multinationals abroad, world usually take much notice regard "small village heart europe". in international surveys, largely ignored, european statistic almost non-existent. sometimes advantage. however, globalise world, rather opposite. success depend heavily marketing. so, let show hide aspect switzerland. you see modern switzerland adjust rapidly change reality world economy. let's consider facts. a boom economy, home abroad with 7.5 million people, switzerland indeed small country, surround economically powerful european union. we natural resources, contrary singapore, even chance gain new territory raise surround sea. nevertheless, highly develop economy gdp per caput clearly exceed european average. contrary situation among neighbours, population still growing, thank immigration. our foreign population represent 20% total population 25% labour force. despite strong immigration, unemployment rate – 3.1% – relatively low. in recent years, economy good neighbour country term growth employment. at probably close 3% year, economic expansion potential. obviously, fact member european union obstacle development. this good news. however, switzerland remain slow-growing country – compare singapore "east asian tigers". our weak growth performance long run due part full employment, relatively high level personal income limit scope domestic investment. like many highly develop industrial nations, switzerland increasingly producer services. the flagship service industry financial sector, expand markedly 1990s account 15% gdp – machine tool industry chemical industry together. during period, however, number bank reduce half number 1 switzerland rank fifth term european visitor arrival singapore, behind france netherlands. bi review 85/2006 1 bank employee remain stable despite expand financial activities. these figure show financial industry eager react swiftly challenge pose globalisation. switzerland solid balance payment position. thank large excess save domestic investment, current account surplus constant substantial. contrary popular belief, country importer capital, net capital exporter. our current account surplus represent 15% gdp, level compare asian country like singapore. in term labour market openness, another step achieve next year full liberalisation labour market switzerland traditional member eu. from perspective, good news. we expect new impetus labour markets. europe become even important reservoir skilled labour switzerland. the open integration market put pressure wage country, traditionally high compare countries. the position switzerland asia large swiss firm invest money create job abroad home. switzerland become major investor europe, also asia. today, 4.2 million job switzerland, 1.9 million people work abroad swiss firms. apart singapore hong kong, country foreign investment exert kind leverage. this situation result long tradition swiss presence abroad. in asia, swiss direct investment amount 35 billion swiss francs, swiss firm employ 300,000 people, 20% 2000. in singapore, take example, switzerland among top european investors, rank third uk netherlands. the 250 swiss company contribute 18% total european investment singapore. our trade relation singapore develop rapidly recent years. since late 1990s, total bilateral trade increase almost 50% new record 1.9 billion swiss franc last year. a consequence rapid expansion trade asia, general, singapore, particular, overall significance asian trade u magnitude trade unite states. however, take account relative size potential asia, still lot leeway swiss firms. a similar picture observe respect swiss direct investment continent asia. despite increase 30% late 1990s 2004, asia still account 7.7% total swiss investment abroad. although singapore command lion's share regard – 2.5% 11 billion swiss franc – evident enormous potential expansion bilateral economic relation two countries, even switzerland emerge asian countries. for historical geographical reasons, country expose considerable commercial risk europe, 60% export go european countries. these european market long dynamic, become future. clearly, recent years, emerge economy asia become one vibrant region global economy. this precisely globalisation make sense economy open international markets, ours. therefore, essential step diversification process ensure expansion export sector. it best interest strengthen economic relation asia. with liberal philosophy sound financial stand necessary tool pursue policy openness enhance strong presence abroad. our monetary framework switzerland well-known stable monetary framework. average inflation last 20 year 1.8%, last 13 years, price stability. we never go monetary reform many european country do past decades. our monetary regime unchanged since 1973, peg u dollar removed. today, swiss franc freely determine market forces. a representative country float exchange rate thirty year now, i underscore importance exchange rate regime reflect reality market. during past three decades, 2 bi review 85/2006 swiss franc essential factor development swiss economy. however, never reason exporter sit back relax. on contrary, swiss franc put pressure become efficient specialise product area real competitive edge. consumer also profit strong swiss franc price import good fall significantly. a currency accurately price enable economy benefit improvement term trade trigger productivity increases. that switzerland firm believer flexible exchange rates. another advantage flexible swiss franc change international monetary system little bear currency, largely determine economic reality switzerland. consequently, launch euro 1999 – probably important event monetary scene recent year – lead disappearance destabilisation franc fear some. though euro – intent purpose – accept mean payment switzerland, euro circulation french francs, german mark italian lira prior monetary integration. furthermore, calm characterise foreign exchange market europe since disappearance national currency mitigate speculative pressure franc. when euro launched, exchange rate swiss franc 1.60; 1-2 cent rate – words, almost unchanged. on whole, euro stabilise monetary scene europe, currency therefore le volatile before. to sure, float rate still mean volatility, especially case market disruption. at times, swiss franc push level long compatible economic reality country’s fundamentals. however, episode usually last limit period only. after september 11 outbreak war iraq, safe-haven function franc trigger 10% appreciation currency euro. a consequence, pursue aggressive interest rate policy ecb order low attractiveness currency give economy room manoeuvre. also, current business cycle, rapidly grow swiss economy, start lift interest rate early – independently – ecb. in last two years, already increase interest rate six occasions. contrary pessimistic assumption swiss national bank would force shadow policy european central bank, able set interest rate accord need swiss economy. and continue so. sum up, happy central banker outcome test impose change european monetary system. why join eu euro realistic option and european issue? a know, member european union, i foresee switzerland join eu near future. the swiss people remain sceptical efficiency union aware stand lose term political right economic freedom event integration. but relationship eu key importance, since europe account two-thirds foreign trade, i mention before. in order secure access european market avoid discrimination, conclude two package bilateral agreement union – one 2002 one 2004. the present situation – free movement goods, capital labour, without monetary fiscal integration – probably best solution us. in short, relationship europe well organise established. at point, one specific question often arises: if well integrated, peg franc euro instead pursue independent monetary policy? wouldn't help eliminate exchange rate risk, without give monetary flexibility entirely? the answer certainty peg would engender foreign exchange stability exporter sometimes dream of. we learn experience flexible exchange rate explicit foreign exchange target stimulate appetite speculator instead calm situation. and would especially true peg decision take unilaterally, without prospect full permanent integration euro area. today, global market global speculation, illusion believe central bank defend specific exchange rate target. the exception would economy whose currency serf peg strongly convergent domestic economy. bi review 85/2006 3 furthermore, nominal peg euro would little stabilise real value swiss franc – thing matter international competitiveness swiss economy – stabilise franc vis-à-vis third currencies, especially u dollar. last least, switzerland enjoy low interest rate europe. this situation nothing appeal bank secrecy, many believe, abundance save high degree price stability. since introduction euro 1999, average interest rate three-month swiss franc deposit – 1.4% – le half rate euro deposits. if switzerland give monetary independence peg franc euro join euro area, swiss interest rate would increase european levels. since high interest rate mean low asset prices, low level investment, also high mortgage rates, swiss are, understandably, keen give national currency. a major decision kind would approve public referendum switzerland; prospect eu euro membership near future thus highly unlikely. conclusion have choose option free trade free movement capital, switzerland is, many respects, good prepare others take advantage great open border bring globalisation. to sure, easy ride, international competition always necessitate painful adjustments, switzerland exception respect. give openness, immediately affect slowdown world economy. on hand, current circumstances, take full advantage worldwide business activity healthy. when take stock last years, bottom line look favourable. however, would certainly even good position build strong presence emerge economies. contrary people believe, i fully convince globalisation cause weak growth unemployment switzerland; indeed opposite true. foreign trade engine drive economy. it expand recent year step global economy. by contrast, domestic market much le dynamic register limit gain productivity. in compare switzerland singapore many similarity evident. a small countries, u simply choice trade rest world, want prosper. in many respects, also face challenges: we adjust rapidly change world, remain competitive high technology product well world-class services, focus niche policies. in words, choice opt excellence. 4 bi review 85/2006 john hurley: prospect productivity growth ireland euro area open statement mr john hurley, governor central bank financial service authority ireland, central bank financial service authority ireland conference “prospects productivity growth ireland euro area”, dublin, 15 september 2006. * * * lady gentlemen, i would like welcome one-day conference prospect productivity growth ireland euro area. i extend special welcome come abroad, many case travel long distances. today's event bring together wide range participant discus important topics, academic policy-makers also representative commercial banks, international organisations, public sector, industry group economic commentators. the day divide two sessions, first deal irish economy second euro-area economy. these session begin number presentation invite speakers, include bank's economists, base largely speaker's research. after contribution discussants, opportunity general discussion issues. of course, expect conference end consensus issues. the conference topic one quite range view today's participant naturally present particular analysis. however, i hope that, end day, feel event useful stimulate debate matter critical importance ireland wide euro area. i would like stress conference growth prospect number year even decades. it happen next quarter, interpretation late data aspect conjunctural situation. it focus instead medium longer-term growth potential economy question factor determine potential time. at basic level, factor supply labour capital increase efficiency use time, is, total factor productivity growth. the evolution three individual component - labour, capital productivity - complex story itself. for example, supply labour reflect development range underlie variables, demographic development age migration; also include behavioural aspects, decision whether participate labour force not. the availability plentiful supply labour, even well-qualified labour force, guarantee favourable growth performance. it may necessary, sufficient, condition growth, irish experience 1980s shows. the supply capital another key element economy's growth potential, whether reflect domestic capital accumulation or, ireland's case, significant foreign direct investment inflows. again, story quite complex. it may clear rate capital accumulation and, cases, nature composition investment, weak unfavourable, particularly compare economies. often, however, reason difficult discern. why, example, application information communication technology certain sector u economy, retail distribution, seem noticeably great europe? the answer immediately clear. even intractable, perhaps, question determinant total factor productivity growth. certainly, likely rise skill level accumulate knowledge apply new technology efficiently may account much productivity growth. there also important factor involved, however, institutional factor enhance efficiency capital labour deploy economy response sort developments, include technological progress. in words, flexibility economy, institutional feature give rise flexibility important part picture. this type analysis underlie lisbon strategy structural reform process europe generally. bi review 85/2006 1 the importance research area clear. productivity growth key driver live standard long run. over time, economy's productivity growth performance major determinant absolute level live standard economy relative rank vis-à-vis economies. the rationale behind fairly clear; long run, fairly strong relationship increase output per head, correspond rise income generate increase level consumption. how concept productivity competitiveness relate other? these term often use interchangeably public discussion. in narrow sense, competitiveness often short-term developments, measure range various indicators, including, particular, relative labour input costs. it important pay attention variables. for instance, likely sharp loss competitiveness, stem exchange rate change excessive earn growth domestically, could adversely impact trade good sector cause damage could take long time undo, loss market share closure firms. one distinguish concern, however, concern long term developments. over long perspective, productivity growth matters. by move production low-valued-added low-productivity activity high value-added higher-productivity ones, facilitate flexible market appropriate policies, economy increase export earn command internationally trade good services. it also benefit increase efficiency production non-traded good services. the alternative simply stick low-valued activity and, typically today's world, face limit prospects, due competition low cost production locations. one might able technically maintain competitiveness circumstances, par back labour earn domestic incomes. clearly, desirable long-term strategy. it evident, therefore, certain amount structural change desirable feature economy. ireland undergo high level structural change result generally beneficial. if simply try maintain production structure past, great concentration lower-value add traditional activities, implausible suggest economy could perform manner has. in fact, ireland try pursue approach late 1950s unsatisfactory results. further structural change clearly continue require maintain improve relative position. the policy pursued, therefore, one permit, even encourage, structural change occur ongoing basis smooth manner possible. determine important term promote productivity growth constitute key challenge economic research. the importance topic lead bank prioritise area research alongside ongoing commitment research function ecb activities. the bank also see role support adoption policy domestically boost long-term sustainable growth, well contribute research within eurosystem important topic. the first session today deal domestic economy. it commence overview paper follow others relate two specific topic been, remain, key factor regard. these foreign direct investment role education improve quality labour force. give rather strike growth performance irish economy recent years, i hope discussion domestic economy interest you, include travel abroad. this particularly appropriate time consider prospect overall growth productivity performance ireland. the much-discussed era exceptionally strong growth - represent delay catch-up process, like - clearly behind u now. growth still remain relatively robust comparison mature economy run average rate growth late 1990s. there also number specific concerns, albeit short-term nature. in particular, growth become somewhat unbalance recent years, unusually high reliance construction sector, combine deterioration economy's export performance. the productivity performance economy also weakened, partly response shift pattern activity. the second session today's conference focus wide euro-area economy potential growth. unfortunately, development recent year point rather poor performance relative basis, particular, comparison u economy. europe catch u productivity performance much latter part last century but, since mid-1990s, process convergence towards u live standard essentially stall and, indeed, 2 bi review 85/2006 even reverse somewhat. this reflect pick u productivity growth emulate europe. measurement issue may play role explain differ trends. measure output u take great account quality changes, give value increase investment output high-technology sectors, great volume growth may tend record us. these measurement issue central argument, however. it clear that, abstract them, underlie story, though slightly le dramatic, essentially unchanged. an unusual feature u development fact productivity growth remain strong even downturn begin decade. typically, productivity performance often poor downturn output growth fall back employment respond immediately. this performance also record despite peak information technology investment, perhaps impact previous investment evident lag. in contrast, europe, downturn saw decline productivity growth, although improvement recently. possible explanation trend implication continuation central afternoon session. clearly, prospect european productivity growth important, least, future population age mean worker support dependents. before concluding, i would like say something link conference topic central banking. there number important way monetary policy potential output growth interact. for example, important monetary policymakers reasonably accurate estimate sustainable rate growth economy, stance policy adjust timely fashion avoid inflationary pressure emerge economy. equally, monetary policy contribute maximise potential output growth maintain price stability. relative price movement require re-allocation resource may indicate important signal distort background unstable prices. it also important recognise monetary policy cannot achieve. monetary policy cannot permanently raise output level adopt stance accommodating. this might increase demand short-term ultimately hamper, rather boost, economy's growth potential likely end damage inflationary episode. in specifically domestic setting, bank see role contribute policy formation, specifically, encourage adoption policy support long-term sustainable development. it share result economic research facilitate discussion important policy issues. today's conference contribute bank's overall effort meet goal regard. in conclusion, i look forward interest stimulate discussion exchange views. i pas bank's assistant director general, tom o'connell, act chairman today's sessions. bi review 85/2006 3 glenn stevens: risk financial system remark mr glenn stevens, deputy governor reserve bank australia, response distinguish lecture mr timothy f geithner, president chief executive officer federal reserve bank new york, co-organised hong kong monetary authority hong kong association banks, hong kong, 15 september 2006. * * * it great pleasure ask speak response distinguish lecture tim geithner. a always, tim’s remark thoughtful thought-provoking, contain much wisdom. in chart evolution u international capital market nearly decade since asian financial crisis, note strengthen core bank system term profitability capital, growth securitisation development plethora derivative instrument allow fine unbundling re-allocation risk. a strike feature past several year also way succession event might previously trigger significant disturbance financial market absorb relatively easily. there doubt core u financial system – commercial bank major investment house – do well strengthen balance sheet develop risk management period. i could echo bank country, i suspect considerable number place story similar. it ought recorded, well, long night japan’s bank system seem long last over. but rather celebrate long, tim point issue future go heart function financial market challenge regulator policy-makers grapple. one big element picture on-going growth lightly regulated, often highly leverage institutions, include hedge funds. their record rapid growth high report return average – odd period poor return – attract lot attention investors. ten year ago, hedge fund regard exotic asset class, increasingly see part main stream pension funds, university endowment like. financial institution also increasingly habit establish in-house vehicle tap appetite hedge-fund-type investment part investors. even large privately own non-financial company operate internal investment fund are, intent purposes, hedge funds. indeed, term ‘hedge fund’ seem use rather loosely use be: really talk investment vehicle will able take advantage vast array financial products, 24-hour trade ample liquidity expose fund sophisticate investor virtually conceivable type risk. the growth fund aspect globalisation – process national barrier trade goods, service capital erode economic financial activity increasingly organise trans-national basis. but like many aspect modern globalisation phenomenon, hedge fund leave people mix feelings. we could debate merit otherwise hedge fund hlis length. here hong kong would be, i suspect, fairly robust discussion! their defender claim that, exploit (and thereby eliminating) price anomaly le encumber prudential control financial institutions, hedge fund promote efficiency allocation capital search return effectively others. on assumption, moreover, put money hedge fund know risk take – might, increasingly, big assumption – people might take view investor money business. critics, hand, claim hedge fund overwhelm distort small markets. a tendency herd behaviour, application leverage, amplify problem, view critics. when hedge fund decide simultaneously get position, disrupt market functioning. small countries, include hong kong, occasion felt though hedge fund single rough treatment, resource available hedge fund far exceed small country seek maintain, macroeconomic management reasons, particular constellation interest rate exchange rates. bi review 85/2006 1 i suspect supporter critic have, times, overstate arguments. but, event, like not, hedge fund leverage entity stay. for part, entity question essentially financial investment vehicle outside normal prudential regulatory net. and point always set entities. for certain degree risk-taking behaviour investor wish engage in, find way it. if regulatory net move out, activity move beyond it. that, i believe, lesson hard learn regulate environment prevail country bulk second half 20th century. it certainly one i carry clearly mind watching, early career, heavily regulate australian financial system time. my guess hedge fund know exist, regulate behave differently, would invent name. this colour way approach question regulation. specifically, relation hedge funds, essentially two issue regulator need address: • the position investor entrust money funds. in view, essentially ensure sufficient disclosure allow investor make inform judgement risk returns. in australia, regulatory authority draw distinction hedge fund investment managers; regulatory regime determine entity does, rather called. this ensure level play field. • ensure activity investment manager subject prudential supervision threaten financial viability firms, banks, are. this approach emphasis counterparties hedge fund hlis (that is, prime brokers, bank investment houses) importance strong risk management, collateral, know customer on. the aim preserve prudential strength core part system interest economic financial stability, allow part beyond prudential net play role take risk. but approach, rely good deal market discipline, get easy implement. a tim notes, increase complexity activity various investor make hard one counterparty know whether really good understand customers’ business (including competitors) therefore exposures. their direct exposure might considerably small indirect ones, perhaps come light condition duress. it abnormal conditions, liquidity market pressure, leverage employ fund damaging. it moment market prone freeze up, participants, wary unknown exposure others leverage risk-takers, pull back. but maintenance liquidity smooth function market become central financial stability even regulate institution become sound, participant come rely market risk management. hence dislocation serious consequences. i sceptical, incidentally, argument hedge fund like necessarily add liquidity. liquidity mean able change position without affect price, depend someone prepare make price. hedge fund activity add turnover, probably mean good time incentive price makers. but condition pressure, leverage investor likely need use liquidity market able contribute it. on occasion – liquidity need – fund surely liquidity takers, providers. additionally, is, tim acknowledge quite clearly, inherent conflict certain time horizon market discipline competition business. precisely hedge fund et al add turnover, considerable business direct financial intermediaries. when money flow big funds, return high, likely able dictate term various banks, investment banks, prime broke get share business. at times, market discipline likely eroded. in fact, raise much broad issue risk perception management hedge fund per se, tim make good points. in particular, emphasis tail events, uncertainty surround estimate potential losses, well targeted. risk management technique need extend beyond calculation var like – complex calculation already – think whether possible size loss associate 2 bi review 85/2006 one-in-a hundred event really well describe standard distribution draw recent history. they need also contemplate possibility correlation portfolio future different history. this point take importance, judgement, backdrop remarkably benign environment past decade many countries. a tim notes, succession financial event absorb capital market apparent equanimity. simultaneously, macroeconomic performance number industrial country characterise great stability – so-called ‘great moderation’. these two factor – macroeconomic stability financial resilience shock – must surely related, mutually reinforcing. it plausibly argue risk genuinely lower, respect extent, period.1 but behaviour adapt perception economic risk lower, often result risk take financial structure. low macroeconomic volatility surely one factor, example, encourage mark increase debt household content carry many countries. this mark u country apparent number others, number grow. if make way asia yet, long. to sure, financial innovation competition also work supply side capital market – mean wary erode credit standard – macroeconomic back-drop critical. how household behave condition great macroeconomic stress, surely one day occur, cannot yet know. it fair bet, though, historical loss experience type lending, directly indirectly via business portfolios, probably good guide future. more generally, long period interest rate low fairly steady, however well justify might apparently short-term macroeconomic fundamentals, also cause behaviour change. the search yield eventually explore fairly remote territory – pension fund retail money go hedge funds, rise private equity funds, use ever exotic strategy various manager generate returns. the real question whether investor consciously accept high risk order keep sort nominal rate return characteristic different era, whether are, fact, cognisant degree risk take on. those issue remain future. i think tim geithner put spotlight many right questions. it supervisor charge financial stability try foster climate risk manage way quench competitive inventiveness markets, still secure resilience when, inevitably, difficult time arrive.

financial crisis international perspective speech mr stefan ingves, governor sverige riksbank, danish financial supervisory authority, copenhagen, 12 september 2006. * * * thank invite today. it easy forget financial crisis entails, number year pass since last experience one therefore important remind ourselves. although cannot yet see immediate threats, must look ahead prevent potential crises. during twenty minute today i intend talk following: • fact various crisis different country 1980s 1990s number common causes, • fact important invest prevent manage crises, • fact risk potential vulnerability financial system change rapidly difference bank financial institution decline cross-border integration intensifies, • fact cooperation authority within country must develop further, regard regular monitor crisis management. in particular, necessary discus responsibility cost divide event crisis. many experience i describe refer crisis country outside scandinavia, even outside europe, prevent relevant discussion. however, i case refer directly situation nordic countries, regard advantage also challenge present far-reaching integration financial systems. introduction an imf study publish year ago indicate around 130 financial crisis fifteen-year period 1980s 1990s; country afflict once. a know, also share crisis nordic countries. denmark manage good country – acute systemic crisis, incident individual bank suffer major losses. many international study point large cost link crisis – cost individuals, company society whole, direct financial cost indirect social costs. for example, crisis indonesia cost around 60 per cent country's annual gdp. a world bank study show poverty combat country reverse twenty years. the conclusion is, course, important prevent crisis manage crisis way minimise damage. in early work imf, i directly involve crisis management several countries, also prevention work. my assessment many country make considerable effort recent year reduce vulnerability financial systems. at time, much remain done, least meet constant change financial world. what give hope really happen international pressure increase – country wish become full member global financial system force least live international minimum standard. so factor lead crisis deal with? experience crisis large number country around world it possible divide crisis affect financial sector financial sector form part – aggravate – broad economic crisis, case sweden 1990s. the broad economic crisis usually base untenable macroeconomic imbalances. large deficit central government finance current account, unrealistic bi review 83/2006 1 exchange rate similar. one experience sweden share many country large essentially desirable deregulation process policy change may lead crisis manage properly. the broad crisis comprehensive difficult resolve, partly possible solution clear-cut entail weigh different social interest one another. however, even crisis specifically affect financial sector, usually primarily banks, often root weakness outside sector. these crisis often result combination "bad policies, bad bank bad luck”. accord study make by, instance imf employees, bank crisis often due one combination factors: • a lack competence banks, combine weak regulation supervision lay foundation potential problems. this could question inadequate credit grant policies, exaggerate confidence loan collateral, inability detect risk concentrations. • criminal abuse banks, improper action owner insider "common criminals" nick leeson barings. • malpractice authority towards banks, instance non-commercially direct lending. • many country also suffer supervisory authority lack sufficient independence. the government become involve authority’s operational decision prevent necessary measure implement problem banks. • weakness structural factors, law courts. there may also flaw financial security net, instance deposit guarantee rule close banks, mean authority postpone deal problem arise long possible. the crisis aggravate solution become severe expensive cases, instance central government poor finance bankrupt (indonesia 1998). it lack capacity intervene sufficient financial support measure manage crisis. if country strongly dollarised currency board (argentina 2001) another form fix exchange rate regime, possibility take certain measures, supply economy large amount liquidity. finally, i see case financial sector large relation rest economy (thailand 1997), negative contagion effect society whole much greater. how one prevent financial crises? in experience, much achieve authority financial participant together draw effective preventive measure plan good crisis management. one clear positive conclusion crisis past twenty year good crisis management save large amount money reduce disruption society. on hand, demonstrate bad crisis management aggravate crises, partly spread uncertainty among general public financial market agents. good crisis management involve create good laws, regulation supervision. i see deficiency field many countries. the legal framework may insufficient, include external condition good supervision, poor audit accounting. in country even possible question whether rule law prevail there; say, whether law ultimate guide principle country governed. manage crisis also require law regulation enable problem institution close quickly manage way. sometimes necessary take measure quickly, perhaps even day. it possible wait usual court process completed. to avoid lead form malpractice, injure party opportunity obtain redress damage afterwards. we kind law sweden financial crisis. another question court allow stop important authority decision intend deal acute bank problems, close problem bank. when bank need closed, difficult balance arises, owners' interest savers' interest, safeguard law. one current example dilemma sweden case custodia. both country administrative court finansinspektionen (the swedish financial supervisory 2 bi review 83/2006 authority) make assessment basis take account, say customers' interest company owners' interest respectively. however, i feel unsatisfactory sweden clear legal framework manage type situation i assume difficulty quickly repaired. crisis prevention also include create sufficiently strong public authorities. unfortunately, one see authority many country insufficient resources, independence competence match often financially strong rich expertise financial institutions, whose owner moreover easily gain support politician supervisory authority’s demand measures. this course serious weakness problem situation lack measures, insufficient measure delay measure aggravate crisis. another problem, although fortunately one nordic countries, harassment management personnel within public authority purpose reduce ability willingness take supervisory measure wrongdoing banks. in addition, important establish clear role area responsibility public authority within country, authority different country also authority financial institutions. i see country unclear authority make decisions, authority power decide particular issue, law unclear follow practice. this lack clarity accentuate crisis situation hamper crisis management. this express different ways, poor coordination authority regard public statement decision territorial conflict arise special interest favour general solutions. if one wish detect problem good time, develop crisis, important public authority within country different country coordinate exchange information. there large inadequacy field previous crises. this extent blame confidentiality regulations, relevance may question crisis, honesty also blame many case authority insufficient interest collaborating. tendency financial sector the financial sector subject rapid development. the border different financial activity eroded. bank sell insurance-like product insurance company sell bank products. in case financial conglomeration established. moreover, trade financial instrument develop extent risk spread great number agent also spread outside bank insurance companies. another development cross-border integration, particularly nordic countries. danish bank establish sweden swedish bank denmark. integration positive development, several reason least increase economic growth. the riksbank therefore support measures, instance within eu, lead great integration. it therefore important authority manage risk integration might entail avoid setbacks. in addition complication follow institution establish several countries, supervision risk management make difficult bank group sometimes choose manage risk functional basis accordance bank’s forma organisation. for example, bank operation several country choose locate credit management one country liquidity management another country. in general, development strengthen financial stability. the capacity identify, manage reduce risk increased. the institutions’ cross-border operation make le dependent economy individual country develops. however, time number new possible problem arise, must prevent manage institution authorities. risk vulnerability may fall different authorities’ countries’ field responsibility thereby may go unnoticed. or, noticed, territorial conflict may arise, make difficult implement measure needed. it may also unclear risk end up. bank supervision ensure bank sell certain risks, clear whether buyer knowledge financial strength manage risks. in bad case scenario, risk return bank loss situation. the development i describe must meet increase harmonisation regulation supervision, sector countries. this already achieve bi review 83/2006 3 extent within eu, need achieve global basis. moreover, coordination exchange information must strengthen “peacetime” crises. not surprisingly, i consider important implement regional financial stability analysis detect possible vulnerabilities; type analysis make imf-led exercise nordic-baltic region. furthermore, institution public authority must gain great knowledge risk end might happen ultimate risk-takers suffer problems. the nordic country baltic country financial integration come long way nordic baltic countries. there close collaboration central bank financial supervisory authority nordic countries. we agreement consultation event crisis hold joint crisis exercises. a swedish bank play important role baltic countries, discussion way sign consultation agreement swedish baltic authorities. one important weakness remain unclear distribution financial cost country event crisis. a closely-linked also unsolved issue country’s assessment situation prevail may decide measure close bank. be danish taxpayer prepare help pay save nordea’s operation crisis see problem swede alone? the question reversed, ask swede would regard crisis danske bank. these issue unique countries; apply country therefore require wide-scale international management. this difficult important issue discus – next crisis occurs. one mean make issue concrete could hold new nordic crisis exercise base condition real bank. it would necessary type exercise take stand specific case, turn might make easy continue general discussion. conclusion the crisis 1980s 1990s lead many important measure taken: a number international standard adopt create global minimum standard regulation supervision, instance basel committee’s core principle effective bank supervision. the task imf world bank increase systematically identify vulnerability countries’ financial sectors, propose measure remedy give technical assistance. the private agent financial market also take initiative reduce risks. they have, instance, establish cl bank reduce risk foreign exchange trading. the bank public authority currently much good grasp risk financial sector manage reduce – probably part explanation see clear decline number bank crisis recent years. at time, development i outline above, include creation large financial group payment centres, lead new type risk need managed. the consolidation part market must therefore meet increase coordination part regulation public authorities. we need regulation supervision; challenge regulation supervision must always adapt development and, now, aim detect remedy critical vulnerability financial system. this sound obvious, easy achieve practice. commercial development rapid, always take little long adapt law public authorities, particularly regulation supervision time harmonise across national borders. from work various international forums, i know danish authority general share view importance issue i mention today i look forward continue cooperation various way prevent financial crisis thus avoid manage together. 4 bi review 83/2006 ajith nivard cabraal: standards, code rule – friend foe poor nations? presentation mr ajith nivard cabraal, governor central bank sri lanka, luncheon commonwealth finance ministers’ meeting, colombo, 12 september 2006. * * * your excellencies, honourable ministers, distinguish delegates, lady gentlemen, on behalf central bank sri lanka, great pleasure welcome sri lanka host luncheon today. i hope pleasant journey able settle well city ready face rigour tight programme ahead next days. i also delight i opportunity speak afternoon, know provide platform share think diverse group constitute commonwealth. a know, family commonwealth country truly global, multi-ethnic, multi-religious, multi-cultural, multi-national collection vastly differ economies, society political ideologies. it may also inappropriate state commonwealth enrich greatly diversity. at time, mindful country within group various stage economic development, range poor develop nation annual per caput income u dollar 160 wealthy industrialize nation per caput income u dollar 36,000. hence, although may, general, say derive strength diversity, still take serious note great disparity live standard issue need uppermost mind move forward harmony brotherhood. in context, i think appropriate that, year, commonwealth finance minister decide focus several dimension option impact issue, bear fact select “agenda growth livelihood”, year’s theme meeting. your excellencies, distinguish delegates, in order critically examine issue wealth disparity perspective, let u take mind back commonwealth head government meet singapore year 1971. at meeting, declaration commonwealth principle adopted. these principle acknowledge wide disparity wealth exist different section mankind. the head government also acknowledge disparity great tolerate disparity would create world tension. accordingly, commonwealth resolve work towards progressive reduction disparities. the declaration undertake steer group’s effort overcome poverty, ignorance disease, well raise standard life achieve equitable international society. 20 year later, 1991, harare declaration issued. this declaration concede many commonwealth country still poor face acute problems, include excessive population growth, continuation poverty, debt burden environmental degradation. at time, acknowledge disparity among member appear worsened, favourable result also achieved. for example, despite widen economic gap, many nation able establish good democratic processes, good administrative frameworks, independent judiciaries, keen respect human, fundamental labour rights, several social successes. those course significant achievements, proud able create condition countries. notwithstanding gain note 1991, many subsequent successes, may still admit collective effort address one fundamental principle singapore declaration, namely, address issue income disparity, been, large, unsuccessful. today, 35 year singapore declaration, actually become even acute, consequently, need respond widen gap appropriately, urgently. your excellencies, distinguish guests, a know, country affluent today affluent point time history. however, reach affluent status today various action initiatives. obviously therefore, case successful outcome, could learn case bi review 83/2006 1 studies. in fact, sri lanka felt professionally objectively. we begin examine economic political environment many highly successful country operated. we study external internal condition prevail early day growth countries. we also attempt analyze factor enable country break shackle reach stable platform launch next level development. in exercise, one key find that, journey reach develop industrialize country status, many country immense space flexibility grow uninhibited environment. further, present day rich country growing, (from per caput income u dollar 1,000 u dollar 10,000), face obstacle movement capital labour. they overly concern human labour rights. they free impose trade quota grant visible obvious subsidy local entrepreneur farmers. they subject stringent global standard copyrights. they desperately worry safeguard ozone layer environment. they make much fuss money laundering. they spend expensive professional time money compliance tests. they deal 24 x 7 medium reports. the list go on. some even ready access natural human resource countries, ruled. but today, many low-income countries, despite potential grow function “international environment” “controlling” almost economic activities. accordingly, seriously constrain stringent benchmarks, however wonderful may be, rapid development point view, pose serious continuous challenges. for example, time country desperately attempt break free poverty trap, allocation resource way aid inflow wealthy nation reducing. in fact, net official resource inflow develop country negative 2005 project remain negative next year well. in meantime, although commonwealth group support doha declaration wto move towards direction free possible flow multilateral trade term fair equitable all, take account special requirement develop countries, current multilateral trade negotiation move right direction. hence, clear present day poor nation struggle emerging, highly complex control economic environment, also face reduce resource transfers, accord special treatment afford order propel poverty. some may however argue tremendous benefit globalization level play field advantage available care access, unfortunate person unable take advantage conditions. nevertheless, i believe aware weak community less chance access situation lead widen even further, ever-widening gap. therefore, timely appropriate forum address need impress upon wealthy nation increase aid flows, open great trade opportunities, move towards high investment resource build-up low income countries. l i misunderstood, let add that, moment i suggest progressive step world international community take past decade develop new standard norm way, inappropriate unwelcome. those initiative certainly necessary beneficial overall advancement society. but, must, time, collectively address ever grow constraint arise inflexibility restriction impose transfer capital, wealth, skills, knowledge imposition new standards, may consciously unconsciously act subtle barrier poverty alleviation. your excellencies, honorable ministers, distinguish guests, in order u appreciate fact i say something new, let quote principle set singapore declaration, affirm harare. “our aim achieve free possible flow international trade term fair equitable all, take account special requirement develop countries, encourage flow adequate resources, include governmental private resources, develop countries, bear mind importance true spirit partnership, establish purpose develop countries, condition conducive sustain investment growth”. 2 bi review 83/2006 while principle enunciate laudable noble philosophy unfortunate reality may plethora may call “worthy restrictions”, (albeit may great good mankind), may actually unwittingly assist keep develop country tight trap poverty. the powerful message emerge situation clear. the present low-income countries, struggle unsympathetic environment, need understanding; great allocation fund investment; increase direct aid flows; tangible support direct concession recognize satisfactory “compliance”. at stage, i would like acknowledge step right direction follow advance country certain target schemes, gsp+ scheme, provide welcome relief low-income countries. unfortunately however, even concession often couple stringent criterion rule origin add ever grow list “do’s don’ts”, list must quite nightmare keep track these! of course serve create new breed corporate executive titled, “compliance officers” (co’s), may rate, soon end become even important ceo’s!! your excellencies, honorable ministers, distinguish guests, the principle relation address income wealth disparity among nation equally applicable society within nation well. towards end, i please announce distinguish audience sri lanka already develop comprehensive policy framework “mahinda chintana”, base election manifesto submit president mahinda rajapaksa last presidential election address issue comprehensively. this policy framework provide sustainable development strategy design address growth livelihood issues, cover income – disparity issue prevail country. a per “mahinda chintana” development strategy, every endeavour make tap domestic resource investment. at time, government clearly realize imperative encourage large scale investment flow country make significant impact acceleration growth process. it accept norm large infrastructure project highways, railways, airports, port power project add stock investment country, also consider good recipe poverty alleviation rather income support subsidies. a large number investment opportunity exist sri lanka doubt many commonwealth country well. in context, need use opportunity provide event today’s meet establish bi-lateral relationship lead promotion investments. while government attempt achieve consensus multi-lateral facility agreements, may also time individual seriously consider b2b investment opportunities. your excellencies, distinguish guests, i confident delegate present forum actively, seriously diligently explore possible way mean promote interactive growth would generate livelihood reduce poverty respective countries. if successfully, could look back proclaim bite fulfill lofty outcome envisage 1971 singapore declaration. thank you. bi review 83/2006 3 donald l kohn: evolution retail payment role federal reserve remark mr donald l kohn, vice chairman board governor u federal reserve system, western payment alliance 2006 payment symposium, la vegas, nevada, 11 september 2006. * * * i please opportunity speak symposium examine continue convergence paper electronic payments. today mark fifth anniversary september 11th terrorist attack unite states. on day, nation come grip terrible event witnessed, federal reserve remain open operating, part help ensure nation’s payment system continue function. in aftermath attacks, financial industry take many step strengthen resilience nation’s critical payment infrastructures. for retail payment system, september 11th attack highlight bank industry's extensive reliance air transportation plane come standstill collection check slow dramatically. this prompt heighten focus electronic process technology could apply check-collection system reduce reliance air transportation improve check-processing efficiency generally. my remark today, reflect think necessarily member federal reserve board, focus future check-collection system future role federal reserve retail payment services.1 a period transition retail payment system today, shift consumer behavior rapid industry innovation, along legal regulatory change, dramatically reshape retail payment system. because increase availability decline cost convenient electronic payment alternatives, many payment recently make paper form today make electronically. in addition, new electronic technology harness improve process checks. the 2003 federal reserve study use retail payment instrument reveal dramatic change consumer behavior. it find that, first time ever, number electronic payment unite state - credit card, debit card, automate clearinghouse (ach) payment - exceed check payments. a range data indicate electronic payment continue increase check payment continue decline. debit cards, primarily use consumer everyday purchases, fast grow segment retail payment system. consumer seem view debit card natural progression cash check convenient electronic mean make payment without incur additional debt often associate credit card use. in fact, least one major network, debit card payment report surpass credit card payments. this shift payment behavior attribute part change rule regulation govern ach network, facilitate use network one-time, nonrecurring payments. a know, past ach use mainly recur payments, payroll mortgage payments. today, consumer purchase stores, telephone, internet complete use ach. regulatory rule change also facilitate use ach convert check consumer mail business provide point sale electronic payments. these new us ach one-time payment drive continue double-digit growth rate ach transaction volume. give dynamic change payment system, federal reserve plan repeat triennial survey retail payment use next year take another snapshot nation’s retail payment system. 1 helena l. tenenholtz jeffrey s. h. yeganeh, board’s staff, contribute speech. bi review 83/2006 1 the federal reserve’s experience check 21 not payment make electronically, check payment also process electronically, part check clear 21st century act, check 21.2 clearly, check 21 begin diminish importance geography physical transportation check processing, bank start reengineer backroom process accommodate end-to-end electronic check clearing. since october 28, 2004, date check 21 take effect, reserve banks’ check 21 volume grow rapidly, reflect trend lead widespread electronic process check not-too-distant future. private-sector service provider offer check 21 service also experience rapid growth volume bank industry become interest capable use check 21 authority clear checks. today, 17 percent check deposit federal reserve banks, slightly 6 million check day value $20 billion, deposit use reserve banks’ check 21 product suite. a expected, depository institution somewhat slow agree accept check presentment electronically complexity integrate presentment back-office process risk-management systems. a result, use substitute check widespread. nevertheless, july 2006 almost 4 percent reserve banks’ daily volume, one half million checks, present pay bank electronic check 21 files, volume grow rapidly. thus, bank start realize many benefit end-to-end electronic check process envision check 21 enacted, include efficiency gain cost savings. in addition, begin offer customer new good services. for example, bank offer business customer ability truncate check deposit electronically. also, bank able set later-in-the-day cutoff hour check deposit transmit check electronically branch central process facility collection. a result, bank able provide customer improve fund availability, efficient cash management services, good access service geographically remote customers. the evolution electronic check collection how electronic check collection evolve year come? the industry discuss several possible models. in first, check image transmit pay bank along micr-line payment information.3 in second, micr information transmit pay bank check image store remote archive access demand. both model already use extent advantage disadvantages. i suspect that, industry gain great experience electronic check collection, superiority one model may become clearer. those favor first model believe allow pay bank good manage risk customer relationships. pay bank would rely multiple image archive providers, may direct contractual relationship, obtain check image customer online bank service backroom operations. others believe small number centralize check-image archives, envision second model, would cost-effective would appreciably increase risk degrade customer service. in model, micr information check could transmit dedicate network or, recently suggest bankers, ach. 2 check 21 remove legal barrier prevent electronic technology apply long-established check-collection processes. before check 21, bank present original paper check pay bank unless pay bank agree accept presentment check electronically. while check 21 mandate electronic process presentment checks, authorize new negotiable instrument, call substitute check, legal equivalent original check. by permit bank use substitute check check-collection process recipient could would accept electronic presentment, check 21 facilitate expand use electronic technology check processing, enable bank industry improve efficiency cost-effectiveness check-processing operation long run. 3 the magnetic ink character recognition (micr) line line number print near bottom check, generally include pay bank’s rout number, customer’s account number, check number, amount check. 2 bi review 83/2006 the ach see potentially attractive option electronic system reach depository institution could eliminate need print substitute checks. the flow check information ach system raise legal question whether payment characterize check electronic fund transfers. if payment characterize checks, current check law bank choose whether receive presentment electronically paper form. a key principle underlie check 21 maintain choice permit bank participate electronic check process business case justify so. require bank accept electronic check presentment simply participate ach system agree abide nacha rule might view contrary principle. alternatively, payment characterize electronic fund transfers, would bank obtain authorization require regulation e convert transaction ach payments? when evaluate relative benefit use ach network payments, must consider threshold legal questions. a perspective future u.s. check system the checkless society predict decades; however, near 2007, know even though check use le frequently, still use widely. industry expert understandably wary predict lie ahead u.s. check system. however, engage strategic discussion future check contemplate investment check-processing infrastructure, need consider check system might evolve. let take first step offer one perspective. the decline check use already cause reserve bank reduce half number office process paper checks. in 2003, reserve bank forty-five check-processing office nationwide, versus twenty-two today eighteen early 2008. further consolidation likely check volume continue decline check increasingly process electronically. ultimately, perhaps sometime late next decade, reserve bank might process check single office nationwide. these change federal reserve’s check-processing infrastructure benefit bank customer entitle early fund availability check deposits, check eventually become local checks, generally subject maximum permissible hold period two business days. this present risk-management challenge bank bank seldom learn local check unpaid must make fund available customer withdrawal. moreover, check collect fast result electronic processing, future check might collect slowly. we already see bank decide process large- small-dollar check differently. specifically, many bank expedite collection larger-dollar check take advantage check 21 authority. on hand, bank continue collect smaller-dollar check paper form, use physical transportation networks, value collect smaller-dollar check fast justify cost so. a larger-dollar check increasingly clear electronically, use relatively expensive dedicate check-transportation network clear aggregate value remain check hard hard justify economically. a result, quite possible take long collect smaller-dollar check dedicated, high-cost check-transportation network scale back eliminate check transport use slower, le costly means. the federal reserve study whether overall improvement check-collection system would sufficient near term justify board’s use authority expedite fund availability act reduce maximum hold periods.4 the likely slow collection smaller-value check could make change problematic near term. nonetheless, i already noted, recent future consolidation federal reserve check-processing region benefited, 4 the expedite fund availability act require board reduce maximum hold period period time necessary depositary bank reasonably expect learn nonpayment check give category. because roughly half check amount le $100, improvement check system due check 21 would likely result fast collection return local nonlocal check near term. bi review 83/2006 3 continue benefit, bank customer many nonlocal check become local therefore subject short maximum holds. if payment system evolve i outlined, possible next ten twenty year reserve bank accept check deposit electronically present electronically; remain paper check may clear channels. in scenario, current paper-check infrastructure federal reserve heavily reliant physical transportation replace electronic-processing infrastructure production data center backup sites, unlike today’s ach network. the role reserve bank provision retail payment service the change i describe could well implication role federal reserve payment system. from inception 1913, federal reserve closely involve oversee nation’s payment system also important operational component system. this latter role involve compete private sector provide certain retail payments. congress originally want federal reserve play operational role reduce inefficiency payment arena. this role change considerably past century, change result enactment statute monetary control act, mca. the mca go long way toward establish relatively level play field reserve bank private-sector payment provider compete past quarter century. however, inherent difference central bank private-sector service providers, truly level play field never entirely possible. the reserve bank enjoy certain advantages, unsurpassed credit rating, make attractive service provider time financial stress. on hand, reserve bank flexibility enjoy competitor negotiate fee service term individual customers. because differences, incumbent u time time reexamine operational role payment system. these assessment focus past, continue focus future, federal reserve’s role provider retail payment services. large-value payment systems, fedwire, typically view core, systemically important services, commonly provide central bank around globe. a rationale participation government-related entity, federal reserve, retail payment system hard formulate. the recent assessment operational role conduct late 1990s, committee federal reserve payment mechanism, good know rivlin committee, focus federal reserve’s role check ach systems. ultimately, committee conclude federal reserve remain provider check-collection ach service play active role help bank industry become efficient. the committee determine federal reserve play important role provide check ach service small remote institution that, federal reserve stop provide services, could disrupt market short run, result high price regulation, little promise substantial benefit long run. in recent years, actively pursue strategy engage industry discussion payment system issue offer service design encourage increase use electronics. a move steady-state electronic check environment, federal reserve may find appropriate review longer-term operational role retail payment system. clearly, time, federal reserve’s national reach long compel reason operational role. a federal reserve ass role provide retail payment services, important consider circumstance provide rationale federal reserve’s continue involvement retail payment service may changed. the review would address, among things, follow questions: if reserve bank withdraw check ach services, would service continue provide competitively cost-effectively? would depository institution continue equitable access services? in event unanticipated shock, would payment system sufficiently resilient? 4 bi review 83/2006 conclusion in conclusion, retail payment system continue become increasingly electronic even though exact nature system yet clear. what clear, however, federal reserve continue foster safe efficient payment system. this shift away paper toward electronic process payment significant operational legal implication u need ponder. i believe ongoing dialogue among payment system participant help u address, balance thoughtful manner, important issue affect long-term strategic direction u.s. financial system. this symposium welcome constructive part dialogue. bi review 83/2006 5 t t mboweni: monetary policy market – two-way street address mr t t mboweni, governor south african reserve bank, star/safmarine breakfast, johannesburg country club, johannesburg, 7 september 2006. * * * honour guest lady gentleman 1. introduction central bank come long way since days, many year ago, monetary policy shroud secrecy. central bank communication akin decipher obscure biblical tract, monetary policy often surprise markets. it almost unbelievable recently 1994 u federal open market committee (fomc) even announce monetary policy decision, let alone justification thereof, leave market infer fed’s action market whether change monetary policy stance. the monetary economist, karl brunner, scathing criticism 1981 argue peculiar mystique surround central bank thrive pervasive impression central bank esoteric art confine initiate elite. he add “the esoteric nature art moreover reveal inherent impossibility articulate insight explicit intelligible word sentences”. a know, thing different today. the pendulum swing opposite direction, prompt alan blinder, former vice-chairman u federal reserve system, refer ‘quiet revolution’. much debate communication focus issue whether central bank transparent. notable economist field blind lars svensson argue maximum transparency, others, example frederic mishkin, argue limit transparency. i argue today transparency communication function decision-making process particular institutional features, effect mean single approach regard ‘best practice’. in look issue transparency communication, point must also make communication two-way street. make monetary policy also involve give attention signal come market. indeed, argument sometimes make central bank simply follow market, raise question take lead. 2. communication market bank it generally agree much market information forward-looking nature extremely useful monetary policy. sometimes central bank follow market movement provide information outlook independent policy crucial monetary policy decisions. price interest rate incorporate information available market, therefore provide important signal future. true, time central bank may information public domain, equally, many private sector institution privy certain information, may superior information specialise research particular area. hence two-way flow information exist practice. the bank therefore take market information seriously look number forward-looking indicators. these include forward rate agreement (fras), yield curve yield spreads, break-even inflation rates, reuters consensus forecast imply forward exchange rate curves, name few. we also privilege position receive wide range detail in-house research domestic international financial institutions. these give u indication market expectation concern various variables. there rich literature information content yield curves. the generally accept wisdom monetary policy determine short end curve significant degree. however monetary policy determine long-term rates. these determine number variables, include real output growth market’s expectation long-term inflation bi review 82/2006 1 expectation future monetary policy stance. for reason usually close relationship long-term bond rate repo rate, although yield curve may contain useful information stance monetary policy, market’s expectation future inflation real activity. interpret information contain yield curve yield spread always straightforward. standard theory tell u long-term nominal rate reflect real rate inflation expectations. but neither component observable, may component well liquidity premia complicate story. also, extent long-term rate react central bank action depend credibility monetary policy. the information content yield curve yield spread therefore always clear-cut. i sure remember long ago chairman greenspan’s long-term interest rate ‘conundrum’ unite states. similarly, south africa, recently tell long-term interest rate affect liquidity considerations, government’s fiscal prudence result shortage scrip market. we would therefore want set policy basis single indicator, would look indicator well corroboration. inflation expectation critical monetary policy decisions. here would rely number indicators, include long-term bond yields, yield differential conventional inflation-linked bonds, reuters consensus forecasts, inflation expectation survey commission bureau economic research conduct behalf. all measure imperfect, indicative and, unless contradict other, could contain valuable information policy purposes. although strong argument take note market signals, solve problems. no matter well-informed market are, central banker matter, perfect foresight. a know, future inherently unpredictable. even make policy optimally basis available information, new information become available time. behavioural relationship nature difficult predict. for example, may expect basis model real income rise, consumer expenditure increase proportion estimate parameters. however, certain unpredictable factor natural disasters, geopolitical influence name few, easily forecastable. a event unfold absorb markets, current price adjust, make previous forecast redundant. this nature asset markets. for reason forward price change time, make difficult easily use market information total confidence. it also explain forecasts, include own, periodically revised. take example oil prices. a know, oil price important factor inflation rate. the international oil price exogenous variable inflation forecast model, inflation forecast critically dependent assumption future path oil prices. we oil market experts, try understand supply demand factor impact market. we also look forecast number institutions, many would specialise oil price model therefore presumably superior view oil price outlook. however, forecast vary significantly. accord reuters consensus survey, june meet mpc, forecast brent crude 2006 range us$56 us$67 per barrel, range 2007 us$46 us$64. accord late reuters consensus survey, range 2006 us$63 us$72 per barrel, 2007 range us$53 us$75 per barrel. this indicate enormous degree uncertainty even among institution put lot effort forecast oil price. we take advice market, whose advice take instance? the average ‘consensus’ necessarily superior individual forecasts. some central bank simply look oil future prices, rather try predict impossible. but know, future curve shift continuously current price change. all tell u today’s price is, imply price next month basis risk-free interest rate and, storage costs. a sudden incident nigeria, iraq iran, new tropical storm system, example, suddenly change spot future prices. similar reason apply forward rate currency interest rate markets. these change almost continuously new information absorb market. the fras example change every time change exchange rate, expectation could lead change interest rates. a study show, even though forward rates, whether 2 bi review 82/2006 currency, commodity interest rates, suppose unbiased predictor future spot rates, nevertheless good predictors. this uncertain environment central bank conduct monetary policy. clearly, cannot change monetary policy daily basis. we take forward-looking, longer-term perspective basis ever-changing data events, news surprises. while rely market information, end make decision basis judgement. the collective view market help u make inform judgement possible. 3. should bank follow market set interest rates? so far i consider issue flow forward-looking data market bank. a i note earlier, strong case bank use information part data policy decisions. i think particularly controversial. a related, complicate issue, question whether bank follow market come set interest rates. in words, monetary policy simply set interest rate basis market expectations? today generally accept monetary policy sufficiently transparent market discount change monetary policy advance. if market correctly anticipate monetary policy actions, little reaction monetary policy announcements. one way achieve favourable outcome simply follow market expectations. however, effective communication, market expectation central bank action independent bank action signals. indeed, important dimension monetary policy influence market expectations. under circumstances, interest rate expectation form independently view market central bank actions. in words, signal change monetary policy stance, reflect current market rate ahead actual change policy stance. under conditions, although could appear follow market, fact lead it. blinder, book “the quiet revolution’, also warn central bank become respectful markets. he argue slavishly follow market could lead poor policy number reasons. firstly, problem herd behaviour, may may rational, speculative financial markets. this result overreaction stimulus whereas monetary policy maker need proceed caution prudence. secondly, speculative bubble fact life. a blind graphically put it, ‘central banker must steadfastly resist whimsy inoculate faddish behaviour often dominate markets. that may central banker much fun parties’. finally, argue market trader tend much short time horizon central bankers. this even case long-term bond traded, fact treat shorter-term instruments. the result follow market, monetary policy could land short time horizon prone overreaction. it important monetary policy maintain focus medium term. we see short term noise blind it. 4. communication bank market a i mention outset, increase transparency feature modern central banking. although transparency essential part inflation target framework, unique framework. it also case communication strategy central bank differ widely, imply single blueprint central bank communication. in many cases, nature communication determine institutional environment. i think safe say record transparency south african reserve bank improve significantly introduction inflation targeting. the adoption inflation target important step towards increase transparency include announcement clearly define override monetary policy objective - is, maintain cpix inflation within target range 6 3 per cent. other element improve transparency include detail monetary policy statement release mpc meeting, publication monetary policy review, monetary policy forum well numerous speak engagement undertake colleagues. of course transparency matter degree, area may feel fall short, evolve process. bi review 82/2006 3 transparency also take far also area i would regard spurious transparency. take example inflation forecast. in monetary policy review, publish graph recent inflation forecast assistance fan chart tool. in monetary policy statement take give idea inflation forecast meeting. we however publish exact number pertain point, although generally indicate peak end point. some analyst criticise bank publish every point along trajectory. i would argue case spurious transparency. it make difference policy decision outcome three year time 4,8 4,9 per cent. what focus overall general trajectory relationship target range. in event, inherently uncertain nature forecast, depict form fan chart illustrate uncertainties. there substantive difficult issue relate transparency. in publish inflation forecasts, question arise communicate path interest rate forecast conditioned. three different method use practice, problems. we adopt approach common number central banks, assume unchanged monetary policy stance forecast period. in so, commit advance particular interest rate path. at simplistic level, approach could tell u forecast target, stance tighten vice versa. it tell u forecast change interest rate changed, although different scenario different interest rate assumption run. it also tell u optimal interest rate path would keep inflation within target range forecast period. thus, interest rate may remain unchanged forecast period inflation keep within target range. nevertheless approach illustrate clearly rationale change interest rate leave unchanged. an alternative approach, adopt number central banks, look market forecast future interest rates. it point various analyst approach contain problem circularity. a note earlier, market rate set extent basis central bank expect do, nothing pin system, lead indeterminacy inflation. the third option, favour number academics, bank give forecast future path interest rates. the central bank new zealand norway follow route. the difficulty public understand path unconditional commitments, change fact change. unless fully understood, adverse impact monetary policy credibility. there practical problem approach. in particular, get committee eight people agree path interest rate next three years, sometimes exceedingly difficult enough reach agreement current move! it bear mind monetary policy new zealand make governor alone committee, reduce practical difficulty associate approach. even full path specified, also question whether monetary policy committee signal future move policy bias. here practice vary country country, ability signal effectively meet often determine nature decision-making process country. where responsibility rest committee decision-making consensus, case south africa, clear signal commitment meet become communication challenge. there time criticise “surprising” markets. it may well instance communication could clearer, also case market always fully appreciate conditionality signals. let give two examples. at june 2004 mpc meeting, interest rate leave unchanged, concern risk inflation outlook. at press conference follow meet i warn ‘party over’. this widely quote press take signal reach trough interest rate cycle. at next meeting, low interest rate 50 basis points, lead accusation mislead markets. there number significant change two meetings. these include improvement inflation expectation appreciation rand contribute low inflation forecast. two lesson come this. firstly, signal give unconditional commitment. these commitment conditional upon thing remain change particular anticipate direction. quite clearly, condition remain instance. the second relate lesson market lose sight fundamentals. instead 4 bi review 82/2006 focus bank say particular point time, keep track fundamental evolving. policy assess whether move justify basis new information. a recent illustration provide april year raise repo rate 50 basis points, take market surprise. however, tone statement issue end previous meet intentionally ‘hawkish’, order signal possible rate hike next meeting. the market recognise hawkish nature statement analyst pick this. yet increase come follow meeting, take market surprise. perhaps communicate clearly enough, perhaps market also listen intently enough. 5. recent economic development before ending, i would like highlight recent economic developments. in past week number data release relevance bank. unfortunately release contain much news, development underline risk inflation outlook highlight past mpc meetings. cpix inflation july 4,9 per cent, slightly 4,8 per cent previous month. the main driver food petrol prices. at levels, still well within inflation target range 6 3 per cent. of concern however broad-based rise producer price inflation measure 8,1 per cent july, high year-on-year rate increase since january 2003. of particular concern well 18,3 per cent year-on-year increase price agricultural goods. credit extension number show consumer still borrow strong pace clear indication demand credit affect recent change interest rates. we aware however likely lag effect seen. twelve-month growth bank loan advance private sector accelerate 23,3 per cent june 2006 24,6 per cent july. mortgage advance major contributor this. trade account data also indicate continue underlie strength domestic demand. south africa’s trade deficit narrow june widen r53,2 billion july. in july, export increase month-on-month 3,3 per cent import increase 6,6 per cent. it bad news however. growth real gross domestic product increase annualised rate 4,9 per cent second quarter year, compare revise rate 4,0 per cent first quarter. although real value add agricultural sector decline significantly, real value add mine sector grow 3 per cent, this follow three successive quarter negative growth sector. the manufacture sector, experience annualised growth 6,1 per cent show sign sustain resilience. the construction sector remain strong grow sector economy. 6. conclusion let conclude say communication bank market go ways. however, communication effective listen other. the bank recognise importance effective communication continue try improve this. we also guard excessive communication, however, much information could also result excessive noise confusion. transparency however mean always tell market monetary policy decision advance meetings. the essence transparency u react consistent manner response change economy impact state objective. thank much. bi review 82/2006 5 radovan jelasic: overall goal national bank serbia speech mr radovan jelasic, governor national bank serbia, business luncheon "dialogue critical economic stability progress", american chamber commerce, belgrade, 10 july 2006. * * * dear lady gentlemen, it pleasure welcome behalf national bank serbia start summer break period. i sure eventful time period summer break, enjoy every minute vacation! before i start answer question i ask focus speech today, i would like emphasize issue regard overall goal national bank serbia time come: 1. bring inflation single digit level without use exchange rate main anchor it go tough ride succeed, usual, despite fact room full people would able give dozen reason cannot happen (history, euroization, lack confidence, etc.). all reason reestablish dinar i heard, discuss answer before. therefore, i would like emphasize national bank serbia bring inflation rate go painless! just like region, traditional populism loud well: “lower economic growth”, “unreal exchange rate hurt exporters” … but instead try convince cannot happen serbia well, please help u advice regard tool need order make happen and, parallel that, hedge yourselves! 2. build efficient financial system the goal national bank serbia build efficient financial system that, addition stable capital base first class owners, also characterize a) low margin cheap services, b) high level public confidence, c) efficient intermediation. we come long way last five year far enough! we more, much improve efficiency financial system, need transparency financial service public education citizens. the ultimate goal financial sector restructure privatisation build efficient system! i problem say that, despite fact rest economy privatisation proclaim ultimate goal! but i never compare financial sector rest serbia, benchmark! 3. finish restructure national bank serbia national bank serbia reduce number employee almost 75% since october 5th, 2000 halve since i take position governor. despite fact average salary increase almost 30% last year, total amount (taking account employee salaries) remain same. and i convince still more! and let move issue i ask highlight! be monetary policy measure effective last two years? yes, without inflation rate would substantially high loan growth even explosive! ha central bank administrative tool stop completely monetary expansion credit growth? of course has. but want it? the answer decisively no! i problem admit i would prefer see low level euroization today, come already good track. a far accumulation new foreign commercial debt concern go challenge medium term! but challenges, i honestly hope, share financial community well, money! bi review 82/2006 1 there lot talks, include speculations, regard coordination monetary fiscal policies. let emphasize issue here: • i talk minister finance often enough coordination fine; • i judge work government base public statement simply impossible, base concrete numbers; • i agree several step government take area enterprise restructure fiscal policy, i hide and, whether i like not, government independent responsible national bank serbia parliament; • journalist master provoke quarrel government (minister finance) governor, i see institution could benefit it, national bank run seat parliament; • and yes, much burden monetary policy central bank i would love get help hand; • last least, i also aware inflation come happen “thanks tough fiscal stance government” remain high “due restrictive enough monetary policy”. but i care comments, results! however, i get annoy instead appreciation i hear accusation government representative fair part and, addition that, even criticize central bank hyperactive! recently i hear lot tenuous criticism national bank serbia regard bank privatisation. let set clear: i/we cause interruption saa talk eu, i contribute substantial increase usd eur yield serbia’s debt, i say serbia need new imf arrangement. these crucial reason may prompt bank come come serbia, reserve requirement short-term foreign borrow two years! i definitely communicate differently industry compare predecessors. i like one-on-one meet give oral promises; neither i suggest general manager need do! i problem admit event commercial bank national bank serbia could avoided. but transition underestimate role journalist love create headlines! last least, exchange rate. “more float le management” emphasize carry national bank since september last year. the event last day 2005 recent week proof need hedge foreign currency position – sooner better. the exchange rate even mention among 3 goal national bank serbia pursue! it take time enter eu, thereafter eurozone, alternative. the central bank allow excessive daily fluctuation either way, rate increasingly determine market! so fall “good old serbian” habit: gain depreciation are, say, normal extra profit automatically pocketed, case appreciation blame central bank! if gambling, cannot accuse casino lose money! i would like finish positive note experience day-to-day basis: rest economy close facility reduce number employees, financial sector hiring, open new branch grow fast. moreover, financial sector one serbia private sector make public one! although something i often question colleague central bank i rough time explain normal rest 2mn abnormal! so much introduction. i look forward answer questions! 2 bi review 82/2006 y v reddy: use technology financial sector - significance concert effort address dr y v reddy, governor reserve bank india, bank technology award function 2006, institute development research bank technology, hyderabad, 2 september 2006. * * * shri arvind sharma, director, idrbt, member govern council idrbt, fellow banker distinguish guests, it give immense pleasure friend bank fraternity. in fact, part annual pilgrimage institute development research bank technology (idrbt). at outset, i would like compliment govern council, faculty staff idrbt continue mission distinction. the foundation large-scale induction it bank sector provide recommendation committee head dr. c. rangarajan, 1984 1989. subsequently, 1994, reserve bank constitute committee 'technology upgradation bank sector'. the committee make number recommendation cover payment system include set autonomous centre development research bank technology. the idrbt create sequel. the institute establish operate indian financial network (infinet), perform research bank technology provide consultancy service apart provide educational train facility bank sector. in remark today, i would like highlight need concert effort enhance use technology financial sector ensure efficiency, stability, competition service common person. technology rbi i would like enumerate record technology-related initiative rbi. first, establishment mechanise cheque process system use magnetic ink character recognition (micr) technology india. these acknowledge world system stabilise well overall reject rate around 1% while, i understand, international rate around 2%. those operate systems, therefore, deserve complimented. second, technological infrastructure create idrbt since establishment infinet 1999. this aim share expensive it resource achieve economy scale. one notable achievement idrbt implementation public key infrastructure (pki)-based electronic data transfer high security levels. third, introduction real time gross settlement (rtgs) system. it result compliance core principle systemically important payment system bank international settlement (bis), basle also pave way risk-free, credit push-based fund transfer settle real time basis central bank money. we occasion compare rtgs system rtgs system place board payment settlement systems. it emerge indian rtgs system, 'y' topology, consider optimal choice topology also adopt several central banks, implement rtgs. our approach towards intra-day liquidity potential gridlock resolution follow international patterns. an evaluation various component rtgs system vis-à-vis critical evaluation parameter set bank international settlements, basle indicate close best parameters. the facility inter-bank fund settlement rtgs available today across 23,700 branch bank span 500 centre country. while reassure note transaction large aggregate value settle rtgs system, average daily settlement amount rs. 60,000 crore, still scope rout many systemically important payment rtgs. for purpose, enhance customer awareness user level would urgent imperative. it essential rbi, bank bi review 81/2006 1 large player market make concert effort regard ensure large-value customer payment across financial markets, systemic implications, flow rtgs, payment equity debt markets. once system achieve critical mass usage participants, tip point would reach possible financial regulator consider make rtgs prefer mode specify large-value transaction financial markets. fourth, creation electronic fund transfer systems. it necessary fund transaction settle real time basis. it is, therefore, important expand reach electronic payment mechanism small-value customer transaction across country. towards end, reserve bank implement electronic fund transfer (eft) system mid nineties, late upgrade special electronic fund transfer (seft) system 2003 enhance national electronic fund transfer (neft) system since november 2005. the neft system, improve version eft system, enhance security feature facilitate retail fund movement multiple daily settlements, enable customer receive fund within two hour settlement. today, neft facility cover 5000 branch 32 bank spread across 200 centres. the reserve bank take mission, expansion reach neft cover computerise / network branch bank outline payment system vision document. the plan provide neft facility initially rtgs customer-enabled branch thereafter, extend cover almost computerise branch bank across country. finally, major initiative, far fund movement concerned, cheque truncation. in order improve efficiency substantially reduce time take cheque processing, reserve bank initiate step introduce cheque truncation system (cts). a pilot project schedule commence national capital region delhi end year. over years, role reserve bank change tune increase level maturity market financial system whole. the role reserve bank future would catalyst change detail financial sector technology vision document publish 2005. in realise vision, need share effort towards set world class it system gain great significance. a first step, reserve bank has, idrbt, facilitate set national financial switch, provide opportunity financial sector. i would urge bank make extensive use facility. idrbt also revamp entire infinet structure consultation user make efficient tune international practices. perhaps, formal benchmarking function system global standard practice may do outcome place public domain. technology challenge bank sector the entire approach towards technology-based bank show significant improvement since initiation reform 1990s. the number public sector bank migrate (or process migration) core bank system (cbs), indication progress regard. the unique feature cbs concept branch-based bank give way bank-based bank treat constituent customer particular branch bank whole. today, 21 public sector bank embark use system number cbs-enabled branch exceed 14,000 14 bank 5000 cbs-branches year ago. some bank reportedly face teethe trouble area i trust every effort would make stabilise system satisfaction customers. i would urge assessment efficiency function cbs bank attempt facilitate necessary improvements. the commercial bank address various emerge challenge include arise large-scale it deployment. these include impact cbs, scientific risk management, good asset-liability management, ensure effective anti money launder measures, security concern relate implementation it banks. one issue, often get raise discussion technology implementation, cost entails. product smart cards, may require significant initial capital cost easily implement large customer base, hold promise future. 2 bi review 81/2006 let highlight critical factors, need adequately address deal it. prime amongst need ensure appropriate security integrity system. security it system effective weak link financial intermediaries, bank ensure security feature incorporate it system best breed. with ever-evolving information technology, security concern remain static system ongoing critical review efficacy security feature measure need instituted. integrity data process store it system ensure bank time adequate back up, include real time replication, extent possible, provide for. another major requirement relate disaster recovery management fail-safe business continuity plans. in today's world, customer expectation high ensure uninterrupted availability it resources, even event rather extreme contingency, assume significance. the bank community, therefore, need put place appropriate contingency plan test adequacy regular intervals. while reserve bank provide common system-wide communication infrastructure, ultimate objective bank develop communication network movement fund within bank entirely manage networks. this avoid excessive dependence infinet improve overall systemic efficiency. though bank already do so, scope progress regard others. there several co-operative bank system extend bank service also relatively large-scale operations. perhaps, essential use technology co-operative bank sector enhanced, appropriate, bring close level commercial banks. technology financial inclusion we highlight need financial inclusion involve provision bank service vast multitude population far exclude services. a far increase scope coverage financial inclusion concerned, challenge need effectively address include lack adequate infrastructure rural areas, relatively low volume transactions, comparatively high transaction costs, factor literacy level target customers. technology offer excellent tool effectively address challenges. lack infrastructure address variety innovative ways, leverage technology. some include use computer system require uninterrupted electric power supply, network use radio frequency non-conventional methods, centralisation process system lead low process costs, provision home-grown customise system low cost, multi-lingual atm develop iit, chennai - provide impetus towards great financial inclusion. in south africa, technology deploy widen financial inclusion introduction mzansi account, card-based, limited-service, affordable save account integrate merchant point-of-sale outlets, atm even post office outlets. in philippines, card-based retail money movement system great acclaim. in india, reserve bank, along idrbt, work use multi-application smart-card system serve bank account also function store electronic cash, data repository essential information relate card holder, built-in security feature biometric identification, also double entitlement identifier social security card. it gratify note nabard report pilot project smart card already launch sri visakha grameena bank andhra pradesh, one front-runner bank finance self help group (shgs). it expect enhance use rural-oriented technology, bank would able provide value addition service offer rural client expand outreach sustainable manner. bank could consider feasibility use smart card 'no frill accounts' help expand coverage bank service facilitate garner much-needed low-cost deposits. here again, approach share it resource would much commend itself. bi review 81/2006 3 technology government sector it would appropriate also outline certain aspect application technology government business since rbi banker central state governments. if scan technology initiative states, find large divergence technology absorption across states. while state like andhra pradesh, maharashtra, karnataka generally ahead others e-governance, begin happen state like madhya pradesh, uttar pradesh, bihar north east. a far central government receipt concerned, government's tax collection process undergo metamorphosis introduction online tax account system (oltas) direct taxes. enthuse success oltas, central board excise customs, consultation reserve bank, introduce easy (electronic account system excise service tax) project envisage comprehensive e-payment module utilise banks' corporate customers. the pilot project advance stage completion. acceptance government electronic challans, base format available web sites, would make process tax-payer friendly. it would also substantially reduce paper usage, provide straight through process obviate error arise reconciliation process, wrong data entry, etc. another significant initiative take sector reserve bank computerisation state treasury throughout country. after detail examination various aspects, step underway establishment electronic linkage amongst state treasury number 3022, agency banks, finance department state governments, office accountant general reserve bank india. this help speedy account receipt payment state government departments, apart serve road map achieve end-to-end connectivity amongst various account agency involved. it need note context use state-of-the-art technology within bank system asset, also pose challenge conventional banker government accountant due increase speed complexity transaction processing. the bank ensure transaction conduct agent government secure end-to-end retrievable point time. a successful example electronic import-licensing system directorate general foreign trade electronic payment facility integrate it system banks. i would like take opportunity mention recent conference state finance secretaries, finance secretary several state government express view technological base efficiency service render bank handle government business need improve significantly. relationship bank encompass both, lend social focus operate banker government, valuable quality service handle governments' transaction high standards, bank may able retain government business current levels. concert effort are, therefore, require state respective banker regard. technology market technology play significant role improve efficiency financial markets. the negotiate deal system (nds) function well. the introduction order match nd (nds-om), help secure good price discovery, transparency trading, report electronic bid auctions. the nds, implement since february 2002, provide platform screen-based trade government security member bank primary dealer facility strike on-line deal anonymously and, thus, experience efficient price discovery. the process involve report deal clear corporation india (ccil) ltd. generate settlement - gross security net fund leg. at end day, settlement information transmit rbi effect books. the ccil also act central counterparty trade guarantee delivery security well funds. we process fully integrate nd settlement rtgs. in order improve function corporate bond market, high level expert committee corporate bond securitisation (chairman: dr. r.h. patil) suggest various measure revitalise corporate bond market set trade report systems, trade platforms, auction platform clear & settlement systems. the trade report system suggest corporate bond line trade report compliance engine (trace) national association security dealer 4 bi review 81/2006 (nasd) us. such on-line real-time data dissemination help participant make efficient trade decision time, enable regulator obtain monitor information market trends. these recommendation examination agency concerned. conclude remark the basic objective deployment technology financial sector progressively move away paper-based transactions, include use currency notes, cheque challans, extent possible, switch electronic mean use rtgs neft electronic mode. it opportune today recognise valuable contribution path breaker field bank technology. the identification technology leader recognition form technology award pointer capable excel respective fields. the award today destination mark good begin - excite challenge era ahead u march towards technologically advance efficient, effective, progressive inclusive financial system. i wish success future endeavours. thank you. bi review 81/2006 5 panayotis thomopoulos: the greek economy outlook speech mr panayotis thomopoulos, deputy governor bank greece, cover bond conference, organise barclays international, athens, 1 september 2006. * * * lady gentlemen, i delight address meet devote issue grow importance financial community. expert speak subject conference i shall try introduce subject greece. it two year since successful conclusion athens olympics i glad observe greek economic performance since vindicate u remain optimist last decade. while two year ago many fear greek economy would slide protract period slow growth even recession spend olympics ended, cite spain precedent, see greek economy remain one strong eu. this performance, achieve context significant domestic fiscal adjustment eurozone’ slow growth recently, indicate greece dynamism reflect important change supply side. in rest speech i highlight main strength greek economy, risk face u necessary policy measure need avoid risk maximize benefit strengths. a i allude before, many fear demand-led expansion run-up olympics would follow significant slowdown even predict greece risk fall back vicious circle stagflation. indeed, 1980 1994, economic performance abysmal: gdp grow 0.7% annually inflation average 16% combine rise fiscal deficit, culminate 13% gdp 1993. consider significant initial disequilibria surprise 1990s believe greece would satisfy strict criterion euro area membership, even join euro area 2001 many doubt would able sustain long high rate gdp growth 4% p.a. experience 9 year 2004, compare 1.9% euro area whole. indeed, fear increase deterioration fiscal situation, associate olympic games’ overrun partly due sizeable additional expenditure security well budgetary relaxation call substantial fiscal adjustment, inevitable dampen effect growth. similarly, point turn-around rise trend net eu transfer relation gdp fall trend would also impact negatively growth. indeed, net transfer fell, 4.7% gdp 1995-1997, 2.1% gdp 2005, growth continue unabated. in addition, since 2004 greece, heavily dependent oil imports, suffer rapid rise energy price well appreciation euro, affect especially greece’s main manufacture export product –textiles, garments, shoe – lift quota confront strong competition emerge market asia country transition south-east europe. the fact greece avoid problem face countries, portugal, period excessive demand growth sign underlie improvement supply side. however, equally important restoration historical link greece country south-east europe, around black sea well egypt. for 2000 year large greek communities, case number hundred thousands, settle prosper countries. the communist regimes, revolution nationalism cause amicable relation wide neighbour suspended, many community disappear towards end 1940s 1950s: example, 1950s 250000 greek leave egypt. after 1990, historical force gravity re-established; nationalism, case eu countries, teach history books. a result, friendly relation neighbour country restored. greece key supporter bulgaria’s romania’s eu membership, eventually turkey’s, well south-eastern european countries. a little story weight history immigration greece last ten year thousand greeks, whose ancestor settle russia 1st 3rd century b.c. who, spite fact cut greece almost 800 years, speak greek preserve many greek traditions. bi review 81/2006 1 until almost end 1990s, greece big handicap: locate periphery europe without direct land connection main eu member surround country whose economic development stall 50 years. nowadays, geographical location become advantage, almost neighbour grow fast, much fast eu whole, soon two become eu members. greece offer country entrepreneurship, expertise capital well market product surplus labour. indeed, greek private sector respond quickly positively open region. greek firm individual speak language know culture establish large numbers. some 5000 greek firm set business country diverse activities, range small bakeries, restaurants, hotel chains, super-markets, food process plants, mines, cement factories, metallurgical aluminium factories, i.t. companies, include telecommunications, trading, ship service companies. likewise, attract low labour cost tax rates, many greek firm relocate plants, mainly textile, garment, shoe make plant well light industries, northern greece bulgaria, fyrom, albania, i.e. move 30 80 kilometre side border. this open establishment network greek firm neighbour countries, moreover grow rapidly, give new impetus greek economy - size market long 11 million greek 60 80 million consumer many include part turkey close greece. the economic interdependence greece neighbour reflect sizeable greek direct investment south-eastern european countries. greek among first two three foreign investor countries. the enlarge market give opportunity greek firm increase size establish different process plant different countries, accord cost advantage, result international competitiveness greatly enhanced. this development particularly noticeable bank sector, i shall refer below. contrary direction capital taking, labour migrate greece: number immigrant settle last 13 year estimate 1 million (mainly wide neighbourhood) raise population 11 million cause labour force increase 20%. for develop countries, probably represent large foreign worker inflow short space time. in total, whole region south-east europe become unify economic space use centuries, first antiquity, byzantine and, later, ottoman empire. it true greece locate in, orient towards region relatively high growth, include rapidly grow middle-eastern countries, whose government national long tradition friendship greece. the outlook country remain favourable indeed, since start decade import demand trade partner systematically exceed growth world trade. while significant, significant note 2005 greece increase market share export market first time decade retrenchment, associate decline textile production, track repeat good export performance year, export good increase 13½ percent first half year, exclude idiosyncratic item refine petroleum ships. a number indicator suggest development statistical artefact may indicate permanent improvement economic performance. the good export performance restrict country destination sectors, quite widespread. the open economic space south-east europe coincide sustain effort improve domestic economic performance underpin three factors. • first fix investment grow robustly: 7.3% annually since 1995, 10% private non-residential investment; compare 3.3% euro area whole. moreover, investment boom affect sectors: second half 1990s industry benefit mostly, fix investment rise 15% annually, whereas first half decade investment service sector, include tourism well construction sector, record high rate growth. • second, extensive privatisation liberalisation unleash entrepreneurial spirit lead creation competent new managerial class, progressively take rein business sector, which, recently, almost exclusively run family member owners. this development owe much grow interest foreign company buy take strategic position greek company follow greece’s decision join 2 bi review 81/2006 euro area. foreign firm recruit greek senior staff run businesses. out 200 big greek company large proportion fully partly own foreign company prefer buy exist greek firms, avoid heavy lengthy bureaucratic procedure set new company greece. the new managerial class promote restructure firm focus efficiency, result labour productivity grow 3% annually ten year 2005 compare 0.8% euro area 2.2% us, country mostly benefit i.t. boom. • third, although government sector still drag economy, progress towards fiscal consolidation tentative effort reduce state intervention simplify bureaucracy start bear fruits. the fact industrial production start grow protract period retrenchment another signal direction indicative newfound dynamism. greece traditionally service economy, relatively small manufacture sector. although greek manufacture firms, exception decline sector textiles, show healthy profitability – profit rate european counterparts– see new firm set dynamic sectors, contribution manufacture gdp continue much small rest eu. the service sector engine growth greece see encourage performance respect main export product, tourism, also many export-oriented service high value-added sector show buoyancy. again, last two year number tourist arrive greece grow fast world tourism, indicate positive image generate olympics produce tangible results. shipping, sector traditionally strong greek presence well recently contribute significantly greece’s export earn (about $15 billion). in effect, 15% world ship 20% world tanker own run greek world. more importantly, greek ship-owners use current propitious circumstance renew fleet, thus ensure significant future presence sector, greek thrive 3000 years. the success olympic game one reason behind favourable turn events. it help tourism, benefit expect along, even merchandise exports, well service sector reinforce image greece stable reliable partner. that positive side-effect much foreseen, focus promote tourism. nowadays, many foreign firm use greece gateway south-eastern european country partnership greek firm penetrate markets. thessaloniki, second big greek port expect play pivotal role economic integration southern-eastern european countries. the border bulgaria, landlocked fyrom 80 km thessaloniki respective capitals, sofia skopje, thessaloniki natural outlet mediterranean sea. likewise, southern province serbia part romania equally serve efficiently port thessaloniki, which, addition interest cultural life pleasant life style. the advantageous location thessaloniki become even evident completion plan partly finance eu north-south eu road railway axes. the renew optimism greek economy reflect many areas. i wish refer example construction housing. there widespread belief construction would main victim slowdown post-olympics period. there talk house bubble supply glut. indeed construction slowdown immediate aftermath olympics level house prices, since last year see renew dynamism sector, unexpected degree. in addition greeks, many foreigner past build secondary residence greek island mainland. total credit growth around 20% annually 30% credit household since 2001 one factor underpin strong private demand recent year fuel low euro area interest rates. i fully accept monitor development area far become alarmed. greece country still relatively low household debt-to-gdp ratio – 38% compare 56% euro area. the rapid credit expansion area reflect fundamental change greek economy underpin transformation fragment stagnant inward-looking bank sector dynamic modern bank sector strong international competitive presence. the lift foreign exchange control mid-1990s household credit restriction 2001 well privatisation merger large number small bank since 1997 create greek champion (up second half 1990s almost 2/3 greek bank control state moreover, badly run, compare 15% presently, manage professionals). bi review 81/2006 3 the big 5 bank 78% market share active modernise business greece also acquire set new bank south-eastern european countries, market share greek bank 20% average, high 33% fyrom low somewhat le 20% romania. in region greek bank employ around 16.000 employee subsidiary branches, thousand eu countries, us, australia, canada etc. the recent acquisition finansbank, fifth large private bank turkey nbg small turkish bank eurobank, well purchase egyptian bank bank piraeus, transform scenery greek bank sector, become international. the size greek bank increase disadvantage small size gradually remove bank position extend activity profitable line banking, e.g. private banking, consultancy m&a, investment banking, asset management etc. greek bank start enjoy economy scale scope. these factor reflect high profitability: this year return equity expect exceed 20%. at time, greek bank reinforce role vehicle facilitate trade good services, investment capital flow well migration country wide region. this lead intensive competition greek bank home market abroad, result high greek interest rate spread euro area countries’ bank loan considerably diminish benefit consumer. indeed, competition financial liberalization allow household good manage portfolio asset liability fast grow economy household would find preferable bring forward benefit expect high income future. there also stock adjustment issue; start low level indebtedness realize greece enter period interest rate much low risk diminished, well rise wealth, household find acceptable carry large stock debt. the flow borrow household adjust high level desire debt may high protract period. undoubtedly, regulator bank system concern know many thing improved. there need good consumer protection good education borrower risk bad financial choices. we forget experience greek last 15-20 year one fall interest rate first converge euro area’s average ecb relax monetary policy. now ecb undergo phase monetary policy tightening, experience rise interest rate may come shock many household greece. in spite this, 2002 2005, saw reduction ratio non-performing loans, reduction particularly steep case mortgage loan ratio drop 6.9 percent 3.6 percent period. a far bank greece concerned, supervisory role oblige u ask bank increase provisions, tighten credit standard general introduce efficient credit control mechanisms, include state-of-the-art risk management unit even non-performing-loans increase car still remain well 10%: today almost 14%. at time collaboration host supervisor south eastern european countries, bank greece monitor closely development home abroad. an area look whether immigrant greece become valuable bridge help trade greece home countries. there anecdotal evidence already happening. i like note greece always country immigration successfully absorb successive wave immigration throughout centuries. greek society always open foreigners: antiquity, orator isocrates (in 380 bc) define hellene share culture, definition speak greek, share common blood, i.e. greek ancestors. even oath alexander great (324 bc), state that: ”unlike narrow minded, i make distinction greek barbarians. the origin citizens, race born, concern me. i one criterion distinguish them. virtue. for me, good foreigner greek bad greek bad barbarian”. the word barbarian different mean to-day refer people speak language greek could understand, sound “bar-bar”. i believe greece see also fruit significant infrastructure investment take place last decade, partly finance eu, tentative structural reform enact period. there also deepen understand among population large, business community particular, greece embrace globalization last 4 bi review 81/2006 improve live standards. indeed, strike note globalization recently pass greece by. we much close economy economy similar size level development. apart location periphery western europe, result undue reliance state provide stimulus growth job creation correspond over-regulation economy, well lack intra-industry trade production basically orient cater home needs. i believe aberration greek history. greek embrace globalization long become fad. notice strong ship merchant traditions, prosper greek community establish world, greek scientist researcher thrive foreign university research centres. continue adjustment new international economic order one-way road greece. we must start admit greece cannot compete labour-intensive, low-wage sectors. rather try sustain industries, look activity develop future. we also realize public sector, already burden debt face pressure age society cannot continue act engine employment creation. but let’s note positive facts: greece posse enormous stock highly qualify scientist researchers, abroad. greek student study foreign university represent high percentage universities’ foreign student body unfortunately many remain abroad entice high earn good research facility greece. but recent year reflect rapidly grow live standard significant improvement urban amenity grow number greek return greece. greece also move country become service economy. we thus good start point thrive knowledge-based world economy. membership eurozone provide stable macroeconomic framework low interest rate inflation well legal certainty allow private business plan long-term growth. a change bear fruit gradual emergence greece source, instead destination, foreign direct investment, particularly toward neighbour countries. while time fear exodus jobs, see investment abroad confer multiple advantage greek firms. first all, enter new markets, learn lot demand there. while much demand fill locally, high-value add export greece play significant role. also, move labour-intensive part production process abroad allow parent firm survive prosper, safeguard high-end, mainly managerial research, job locate greece. it noteworthy outward investment, average amount half inward flows, concentrate sector greece enjoy comparative advantage, food beverages, finance, trade company construction, cement, even textiles. they form thus part greek firms’ strategy maintain enhance competitive position. contrary popular beliefs, outward greek investment flow direct exclusively low-cost countries. the uk u figure prominently among recipient greek fdi, four large foreign subsidiary greek firm 2005 located. this indicate flow use mainly enter foreign market acquire necessary know-how technological expertise. i find extremely encourage year see significant gross flow foreign direct investment, even final net amount may turn small. indeed, outward fdi flow half level inward flow recent years; result, greece stock investment abroad exceed 16 billion dollars, may well underestimate true amount take account complex statistical problem surround collection data fact many greek firm retain (without declaring) south-eastern european country export earn order finance investment instead borrow high interest rate local bank. it become clear greece actively support effort enhance stability international financial system provide guarantee cross-border investments. the inward investment flow show greece become advantageous place invest, also bring important benefits, know-how. outward flow see entry ticket foreign market way greek firm regain cost advantage. while much greece bode well future development, must shy away confront solve exist problems. there need government activism, redress mistake past. in addition, new environment bring new challenge need action. bureaucracy, despite progress last 10 years, still stifle entrepreneurial initiative; bi review 81/2006 5 simplify procedures, personnel good acquaint international practises, especially high echelons, le duplication work necessary order boost private activity also order reduce operational cost state. much say fiscal imbalance i would last downplay need fiscal consolidation. the accumulate public debt burden get rid soon possible. not consume large part tax revenues, also source uncertainty. small change interest rate impose heavy toll public finances, case change investors’ sentiment risk preferences. a similar argument make address linger problem social security systems. both explicit public debt contingent pension obligation form source uncertainty private sector, may reasonably fear revenue-enhancing tax measure future. put public finance order, plan government, achieve least balance budget reassure investor help promote investment country. while aim elimination fiscal deficit, macroeconomic objective reconcile microeconomic objective reduce tax burden economy, and, especially, continue alleviate tax entrepreneurship. this aim become even press face increase tax competition, especially neighbor country new member eu. you may notice regular advertisement trumpet country’s low tax rates. combat tax evasion provide significant revenues, even short-run, time improve efficiency level play field. the long-run solution efficient focus public sector absorb few resource deliver necessary services. i turn two particular area concern, perhaps interrelate ones, high level unemployment, inflation persistence. a black spot otherwise bright picture greek economy stubborn persistence unemployment. after almost ten year continuous robust growth, unemployment remain unacceptably high. unprecedentedly low fall interest rates, real nominal, play role encourage capital deepen substitution away labor. there also significant labor hoard start period various reasons. likewise, agricultural employment still represent 8% labour force, 4 time high eu average and, extent diminishes, outflow rural labour continue inflate total unemployment. still, one deny insufficient employment creation worth take time analyze reason that. first, let’s dispose erroneous arguments. trade globalization cannot blame situation. greece unusually close economy still one high unemployment rate europe. indeed, unemployment fallen, albeit slowly, last couple year greece start open international competition. by token look immigrant scapegoats. they perform job local would undertake. in cases, provide low-cost input help keep production greece, thus help better-remunerated greek workers. this much evident case agriculture production several crop would become uneconomic save abundant labor supply immigrants. instead look put blame outsider unemployment problem, good admit domestic policy main reason unacceptable situation. first, obviously mismatch demand specialize labour supply, call good professional orientation tertiary educational level. likewise regulatory regime, supposedly create safeguard jobs, discourage job creation lead firm try minimize labor input. we adapt economic system change fast overly-rigid labour relation together law encourage oligopolistic practice business sector, detrimental effect employment itself. there also need reduce wedge wage cost firm wage receive employees. this wedge one high europe due high social security contributions. it necessary reduce difference non-distortionary way. another issue concern lack competition rigidity pervade many product market greece. a i travel quite often abroad i often strike much dear good and, especially, service greece european country high wage levels. open foreign entrant international trade well lift entry barrier various professional job help induce great competition reduce power local oligopolies. a strengthen competition authority also useful tool, increase activity certainly welcome. 6 bi review 81/2006 to sum greece, eu countries, face domestic problem also challenge arise unprecedented rapid globalization. development far show greece respond successfully record second high growth rate, 4% average since 1996, euroarea twice high euroarea average. however, continuation successful record require sustain effort towards budget consolidation simplify bureaucracy. indeed, provide policy remain focus promote necessary structural reform disorderly upheaval international front, greek economy continue perform well. bi review 81/2006 7 mervyn king: through look glass – reform international institution text inaugural international distinguish lecture mr mervyn king, governor bank england, melbourne centre financial studies, melbourne, 21 december 2006. * * * 1. what globalisation mean? humpty dumpty say alice, “when i use word, mean i choose mean – neither less”. so let explain first i mean “globalisation”. in excellent book why globalization works, martin wolf remarks, “globalization hideous word obscure meaning, coin 1960s, come ever-greater vogue 1990s”. i think globalisation process increase international economic integration accompany political agreement rule game govern process. the rise china india trade power example increase integration. and accession china world trade organisation example application rule game. globalisation drive force many significant change economies. but far new phenomenon – old human race itself. the european settlement australia represent globalise force migration capital flow several centuries. to one poignant symbol globalisation australian war memorial hyde park corner london. in first half twentieth century – describe isaiah berlin “the bad century ever been” – thousand australian go fight side globe give life cause transcend national interests. one consequence globalisation impact change one part world life people part growing. in area diverse trade, energy, combat terrorism, climate change, economic consequence massive global imbalance capital flow poor rich countries, grow spillover decision one country life people others. in contrast horror two world war great depression, strain stress today’s world seem insurmountable. how best deal challenges? when movement people manchuria subsistence rural agriculture industrial employment influence industry flourish manchester melbourne, change attitude asset management beijing affect currency value hence live standard birmingham brisbane, interest nation states, recognise grow interdependence, make commitment won’t do. such commitment embody international institution – rule game. impressive office grand meet test whether international institution successful. the test whether member country ready make genuine commitment other. without institution lack real purpose. so subject talk today need rule game govern globalisation, institution necessary oversee rules. 2. be post-war settlement still relevant today? at end second world war, new global order put place unite states, britain allies. one primarily responsible, u secretary state dean acheson, describe time “present creation” new global order. a range new international institution create – unite nations, two bretton wood institution (the imf world bank), oeec implement marshall plan (and late become oecd) , nato, gatt (which subsequently succeed world trade organisation). those institution now, part, past 60th birthdays. and much heart-searching past year role governance. unless spirit original founder rekindled, real danger present institution wither vine leave u unstable fragile international environment. a martin wolf pointedly wrote, “to defend liberal world economy defend international monetary fund, world bank, world trade organisation specific institution. these must judge – reform bi review 126/2006 1 discard – merits”. my argument simple. exist institution design world radically different today. the cost close build new institution high. so must work exist institution make relevant today’s problems. unless hard defend open liberal international economic order bring benefit hundred million people around globe. the generic challenge face post-war institution find role relevant present circumstances, decide operational capability instrument role requires. hold meet issue communiqués enough. a central banker, i naturally focus imf, i shall today. but lesson general. it worth note scale challenge. the specific commitment make end second world war long relevant. the share experience great depression, protectionism two world war faded. and majority current nation state “present creation”. the world certainly change since 1945, nature change underpin case reform. the world today different creation post-war settlement two important respects. first, despite increase integration world economy, might appear reduce effect national policies, nation state fact flourish since 1945. the collapse ideology empire, triumph idea liberal market economy, accompany extraordinary expansion number country world. in 1946 few 80 countries. now 192 member un. much increase represent division empires, former soviet union, new states, well grow ethnic separation. most new country “present creation” see reason acquiesce governance arrangement make absence. and economic weight country change greatly since post-war international institution set up. in 1950, asian country account sixth world gdp measure purchase power parity. now account third. second, world economy different today imf, world bank, international economic institution set up. at end second world war, international monetary system build around fix exchange rate control capital flows. the rule game simple. country suppose balance current account. when “imbalances” arose, obligation correct them. in practice, however, obligation creditor debtor country prove symmetric. over time advantage capital flows, particularly private sector, become apparent, world without capital controls, possible maintain independent monetary policy allow exchange rate float. so bretton wood system eventually prove unsustainable, today advance industrial country float exchange rate free movement capital. private capital flow dwarf official flows. and “imbalances” apparently persist almost indefinitely. the u current account deficit, almost 7% gdp, 3% ever since 1999. australia run persistent current account deficit since 1973. accordingly, international institution shift focus attention current capital account flow fragility national balance sheets. those change mean that, time, post-war settlement become le relevant. but need international institution increased. our standard live now, ever, affect decision elsewhere. and many people already feel loser globalisation. the number worker world trade system double short period, inevitable consequence real wage unskilled industrialise world. government work hard explain principle comparative advantage mean people daily lives. in fact, people winner globalisation. china second large buyer australian exports. and australian term trade rise 40% since 2000, provide substantial boost growth rate real incomes. nothing could damage prospect develop develop country alike abandonment trade liberalisation. but protectionist sentiment abroad again, even high employment rate around world. in europe conceal cry “national champions”; latin america populism; unite state complaint unfair competition. but damage protectionism wreak clear – experience great depression enough ring alarm bells. if avoid maintain widespread support open international trade system, interest establish clear rule won’t area 2 bi review 126/2006 decision affect stability elsewhere. and commitment upheld, need international institutions. the role international institution throw sharp relief last week visit beijing new u secretary treasury, hank paulson, high-level team “strategic economic dialogue” chinese government. the issue discuss – chinese strategy economic development implication pace shift labour rural agriculture urban industry, save rate unite states, financial reform china, certainly dollar-renminbi exchange rate – purview several multilateral bodies, new imf multilateral consultation, bi-annual imfc meetings, bis, g7, g20, on. progress bilateral meet welcomed. indeed, exist multilateral forum may simply cumbersome inefficient useful dialogue occur. but many press economic concern cannot easily handle bilateral setting. for example, even infamous international “imbalances” long see bilateral phenomenon: large u trade deficit match large chinese trade surplus. follow rise oil price past two years, large current account imbalance find oil-producing countries. the combine trade surplus opec 2006 likely around $400 billion, compare surplus china $150 billion. the pattern trade imbalance exchange rate movement inherently multilateral one, real progress require dialogue multilateral setting. 3. what principle institutional design? change number nation state way interact mean reform multilateral institution needed. but piecemeal reform unlikely work. in view, five principle followed. first, create international institution need so. international institution focus area global governance need tackle problem collectively – whether trade, environment, large spillover effect change macroeconomic policy. second, ensure commitment country enter clear. the job institution support commitments. in many cases, like umpire, job uphold them. that possible player – country – clear agree rule game. without that, design pointless. third, provide institution necessary tool umpire commitment nation states. but, umpire accountable performance whole community cricket-playing nation international cricket council, staff management international institution accountable whole community nation state performance uphold rules. fourth, recognise start blank sheet paper. we must accept constraint history. exist institution institutional memory, talented staff much infrastructure need future. but say reform easy – far many vest interest case. fifth, avoid unnecessary duplication. because cost abolish institution high, number international group institution proliferate recent years. many tread others toes. a result, imf, world bank oecd, bruised. duplication role wasteful time, money focus. each institution one clear remit, focus it. of course, country play role one institution another incentive build role former expense latter. so member country limit battle turf. there example principle appear followed. the world trade organisation effective umpire countries’ commitment trade restriction come close. but example wto highlight importance, else, clear commitment nation state themselves. the failure country conclude multilateral trade round since wto form decade ago worrying. the doha round continue past expect completion date brave commentator would forecast eventual success. the fault lie wto. instead, reflect fact national government will make necessary commitments. bi review 126/2006 3 4. what principle mean imf? with principle mind, i want consider challenge reform imf. (a) do need imf? the apparent success central bank lead economist argue widespread adoption inflation target float exchange rate sufficient ensure smooth run international monetary system – regime professor andrew rise call ‘reverse bretton wood system’. there need international institution imf watch system. it certainly true important thing nation state minimise spillover effect others maintain domestic economic stability. and exactly australia, britain, country do recent period economic success, know “great stability”. but domestic stability sufficient eliminate spillover effects. the impact national macroeconomic policy decision transmit country important price world economy: real exchange rates; real interest rates, price important commodity like oil. change spend u household affect export demand rest world, directly indirectly movement dollar. change save government asia affect spend rest world movement real interest rates. change supply oil middle east affect income spend elsewhere movement oil prices. moreover, everyone float exchange rate inflation target, country try prevent adjustment real exchange rate exacerbate problem spillover effects. business every country conscious quickly plan disrupt unpredictable swing exchange rates, asset price commodity prices. when spillover sufficiently large widespread, country want engage multilateral set discus resolved. (b) what commitment needed? before collapse bretton wood system, specific commitment make country clear: fix exchange rate capital controls. in wake collapse bretton woods, member imf attempt re-define commitments. but exercise define practical commitment need focus primarily exchange rate rather little effect practice. two broad commitment particularly important. first, country make public commitment target macroeconomic policy – fiscal, monetary financial. that still allow country considerable discretion choice policy framework – example, whether adopt fix float exchange rate. second, policy framework must consistent across countries. policy try prevent change real exchange rate response change fundamentals, lead unsustainable build-up external debt, properly concern international community. (c) what tool needed? the main tool monitor commitment surveillance. the surveillance activity imf criticise pay insufficient attention spillover effect instead examine unnecessary detail microeconomic issues. for example, sharp rise oil price past two year pose risk economic stability many countries. but reference imf’s article iv report china role chinese demand may play push world oil prices. and report unite state year single electricity sector competition among auto manufacturer airline area warrant special examination imf staff. it would good microeconomic issue examine within oecd, and, turn, issue macroeconomic spillover global “imbalances” leave imf. but even imf surveillance well-focussed, analysis thailand’s exchange rate policy 1996, always carry sufficient weight influence countries’ policies. 4 bi review 126/2006 these short-comings must remedied two ways. first, focus imf surveillance spillover effect consistency macroeconomic policy frameworks. by spring meet imf washington april, shall know whether likely see result current review 1977 decision exchange rate surveillance. second, imf surveillance independent member countries. that allow clear message deliver whether country live commitments. a remit set annually. it play two roles: give imf clear mandate guide surveillance activity give shareholder yardstick hold imf staff accountable. great independence staff accompany great accountability. (d) what constraint history? the bretton wood conference imf establish attend government 44 countries. yet even fraught. it would vastly difficult agree complete new treaty 184 countries. the imf much infrastructure expertise need job i describe – annual budget $1 billion it. that make sense attempt reform imf inherit rather build new institution. but inherit governance structure imf institution complicate matters. the founder post-war settlement encumber several new international institution unwieldy full-time resident boards. and distribution vote right long reflect economic political weight member countries. the task agree new system enormously difficult. but fail, influence institution diminish further, possibly irreparably. reform imf surveillance vote right member country complement other. vote right area hard work many hour persuasion need country convince see big picture relinquish degree direct control imf return creation effective institution. hard work, perseverance dog determination characteristic year’s australian presidency g20 peter costello, ian macfarlane glenn stevens. their effort crucial progress make towards quota reform past year. it important australian legacy carry forward process quota reform completed. (e) be overlap institutions? unnecessary duplication waste time money. i already speak respective comparative advantage imf oecd. there also discussion role imf g7 respect exchange rate issues. over past three year – especially since boca raton g7 summit february 2004 – inability g7 deal major spillover effect world economy become evident. add new members, even will join, answer. more productive would use imf flexible forum bring relevant group country together handle issue arise. 5. conclusion the meet imf washington singapore year mark begin attempt define clearly role fund world economy. whether prove successful early tell. but challenge clear. globalisation increase dependence other. it long sufficient rely commitment make sixty year ago – world change much since then. it member country make multilateral trade system work. a joseph conrad write century ago great novel nostromo, “action consolatory. it enemy think friend flat illusions”. the frenetic activity international meet flat illusion stream communiqués add coherent set commitments. failure reform international institution condemn irrelevance obscurity. we point. if generation fails, work “present creation” undone. it duty re-create institutional framework inherited. bi review 126/2006 5 it easy. but case like alice tempt think that, “there’s use trying; one can’t believe impossible things”, remember queen’s reply: “why, sometimes i’ve believe many six impossible thing breakfast”. 6 bi review 126/2006 jean-claude trichet: interview ta nea, d tagesspiegel luxemburger wort interview mr jean-claude

can please describe current risk inflation europe? we have, eye govern council, i express 7 december press conference, several risks. one pass-through past increase price oil raw commodity yet materialise consumer prices. we also risk increase oil commodity price take account. we risk administer price indirect tax augment top already decided. and, fundamentally, also risk associate call “second round effects”, namely spiral wage unit labour cost reflect inflation fear feed inflation. until last risk materialise. it important materialise does, late hard get back price stability. how close second round effect mentioned? there sign risk might augment respect. it one reason last meet govern council special attention give this. it’s important keep unit labour cost, wage salary good order give rise “second round effects”. you appeal responsibility social partners. what would consider reasonable wage increase? social partner forget unemployment high level europe also different level productivity cost competitiveness various economy euro area member states. if want sustainable growth job creation high level responsibility essence. most analyst interpret late decision imply go interest rate hike next year, particular two more, euro interest rate reach level 4 percent. why believe come conclusion? we faithful mandate ensure price stability. i say press conference act firm timely manner ensure price stability warranted. everybody know necessary deliver price stability. we like crew ship. we know go, doubt objective: price stability. what one know whether tempest, whether sea calm, whether headwind tailwind. on everybody make mind. and different view market, different assumption necessary u order deliver price stability. but everybody know crew ship take necessary decision arrive destination. your comment last govern council interpret differently different people. be something actually aim for, clear signal? what market perfectly understand whatever necessary, without tie hand ex ante. the proof inflation expectation well anchored. opinion might differ overall environment, happen exactly vast european economy 315 million people, happen rest world, new chances, opportunity risk might appear. act firm timely manner ensure price stability warranted. the ship know goes. sometimes adjust course ship… that’s reason pre-commit medium term. the member govern council often describe belong different fractions. some “doves” others “hawks”. to fraction belong? bi review 126/2006 1 a president ecb i speak behalf govern council ecb. it oversimplification sum position various member govern council fashion. we profoundly unite govern council, decision make entity ecb govern council fraction it. each u work responsible stability complete euro area, none u represent particular interest, particular economy nation. moreover, i consider collegial wisdom fundamental, namely u incorporate wisdom view others reserve right change approach depend interaction. a president i warrantor govern council treaty mandate: price stability. what ecb good control money supply? the monetary pillar strategy important. a know cross check result economic analysis monetary analysis. we ample liquidity euro area. a example, rate growth outstanding loan non-financial corporation 12.9 percent last 12 months. this show credit presently abundant europe. what think call house bubble? do think one europe danger european economy? we look carefully euro area whole. there evidently bubble germany, whereas number country accumulation price increase last years, suggest close careful monitor warranted. i don’t diagnosis bubble euro area whole, see part euro area call close attention. so alert. be concern raise interest rate might stop main source growth, many see it, housing? by raise interest rates, last week, contribute decisively sustainability growth. if don’t ensure price stability growth sustainable. that clearly understood. we hamper growth! not all. on contrary, permit growth sustainable medium long run. the mandate ensure price stability time – give u treaty – condition sustainable growth job creation. be concern number household accumulate big debt past face serious problem pay back future interest rate hike decide last year? i would ask household feel interest rate high moment compare interest rate economy introduction euro! but household tend forget happen euro. and accumulate big debt last two three year may face difficulty service them. do golden rule suggest households, expose many dangers? if want growth job creation sustainable, thank price stability, interest rate move. borrower know interest rate go well down. greek citizen pay considerably high interest rate euro country citizens. why think happening? be competition work bank system? we govern council, include lucas papademos, vice-president, nicolas garganas, governor bank greece, call financial integration complete possible. in certain domain reasonably satisfied, others progress made. it clear retail bank progress must made. we see that, even currency monetary policy, difference level interest rates. but also take consideration interest rate incorporate credit risk loans. so one understand might remain differences. the competitiveness greek economy low. what measure would suggest improve it? in many respect whole euro area exactly characteristic receive recommendation greece itself: structural reform necessary. we need reform 2 bi review 126/2006 permit good service market flexible, function good fully integrate vast continental economy euro area. flexibility also need financial markets. financial integration complete important efficient function euro area. labour market improvement also take account want whole economy competitive. i would draw particular attention – i talk particularly greece, entire euro area - fiscal policy respect fully letter also spirit stability growth pact. mean good time one save money bad times. we also follow unit labour cost carefully. because unit labour cost one important indicator measure overall competitiveness. what comment rapid decrease german deficit level? it good german government express full commitment strictly fulfil stability growth pact. this resolute commitment positive germany europe whole. ha new government make difference? a know, issue currency preserve price stability all, sensitivity fully multi-partisan way. i would say good germany embark fiscal commitment. the progress make cost competitiveness last year also good. in germany, vat rise three percentage points. how harmful tax hike price stability euro zone? it decision take long time ago incorporate projection since then. it clear impact growth germany europe – see much exactly. there mainstream consideration little hump present last quarter year little bite slump first quarter next year. we see. but think affect german economy – therefore economy europe – profoundly numerous anymore. what structural reform necessary germany europe whole? for germany europe whole message same: actively continue implement structural reforms. the goal flexible, adapt environment change rapidly. it important germany, first economy europe. it important europe whole. and reform pay look ireland denmark, instance. doe size matter? be easy denmark? i don’t think so. there many example big country like canada australia. those flexible economy do well, prosperous lead job creation. i think it’s privilege country public opinion see clearly everybody good economy whole flexible. you name country make progress. could also specify euro zone country difficulty adapting? all country europe, amongst three big one germany, france italy le difficulty adapt. but let add something. we see lose do reforms. we could good off, could prosperity, growth, jobs. but would equally mistake think nothing achieve euro area. i give figure show i mean: since euro set up, 11.5 million job create euro area. now, would say many job create unite state period time? no idea. twice much? 7.2 million jobs! we create since set euro much job us! we recognise characteristic euro area good sometimes perceive even unemployment still much high. don’t misunderstand me: that say enough reforms. it say: we discouraged. we capacity implement reform pay off. bi review 126/2006 3 germany often dub “the sick man europe”. how accurate description nowadays? i always consider description wrong i think sentiment share colleague govern council, jürgen stark axel weber. germany go long period catching-up, overcome loss competitiveness, difficulty reunification – obvious reason unavoidable time. the productive sector germany do important job improve cost competitiveness last eight years. this provide basis number one exporter world. but germany, like europe, still lot term structural reforms. this position challenge china. can germany, europe even compete term cost china india? we economy 315 million people. it vast economy, slightly large term population size unite states. in order preserve high standard live employment permanently adapt. flexibility creativity key world change extremely rapidly. in late introductory statement, say monetary policy remain „accommodative“. some political commentator disagree say hurt recovery european economy. what say critics? i insist defend purchase power weak situation societies. it primarily hurt inflation. survey show fellow citizen strongly call upon u job. they ask le alertness central bank regard price stability. they ask alertness. they entirely satisfy present level inflation europe encourage u delver price stability. if would let inflation emerge interest young people, interest workers, interest least fortunate segment society, would also create obstacle sustainable growth job creation. i feel strongly this. the treaty well written. french presidential candidate segolène royal politician home country demand ecb subject political decisions. what comment? we independent decide political democracies. a know ecb apolitical institution work sake 315 million fellow citizen whatever sensitivities. the treaty maastricht create independent institution work sensitivities, without exceptions. and proud that. the people ask u job independently treaty sign government ratify parliament people europe directly, case france. it true create independent institution important decision. in france call change constitution fifth republic, change vote 25th june 1992 qualify majority (3/5) congress versailles. in recent months, several report corruption involve large european companies, instance siemens. how harmful case like that? we pay great attention fight money launder well terrorism financing. to extent criminal activity involved, i sure national authority necessary. the german bank system may change fundamentally landesbank berlin market purchase buyer. what think potential change? amongst structural reform financial integration completion single financial market single currency area. from standpoint number feature german bank system fit well yet. full open public segment bank sector would interest germany interest europe whole. but leave one example out, kind reform process call make headway germany all. i know fairly difficult. again i cannot help mention fact would superior interest everybody involve achieve reform. what kind time span mind? 4 bi review 126/2006 that responsible authorities. i go mention date. but ecb i say important step would be. growth u slow down. what need do achieve soft land instead hard landing? we follow carefully situation. our scenario scenario federal reserve system, soft slow down, presently observed. how harmful current dollar-euro ratio? do see value dollar rise next months? on euro-dollar relation i would confirm i already said: i sign myself, together member g7, communiqué singapore say particular: „excess volatility disorderly movement exchange rate undesirable economic growth.“ i also note declaration secretary paulson “a strong dollar clearly interest unite states.” how high allow euro go? i say anything more. these sentence speak themselves. how relationship m. jean-claude juncker, president eurogroup? it’s good. the responsibility jean-claude juncker president eurogroup extremely important. he within eurogroup huge domain minister finance appropriate discussion cooperation particular fiscal policy structural policy fundamental. he excellent president eurogroup. europe progress political union parallel way monetary union. we full fledge federation. it also clear constitutional treaty – would important improvement function present european institution – approved, even now, ratification finland, 16 country ratify constitution. that said, combination monetary union economic union – emu – i strongly trust viable credible – include stability growth pact government discus cooperate regard fiscal structural policies. a citizen i would call go forward achieve political union. a president ecb i repeat i consider emu highly credible stability growth pact. there lot controversy able join eu. do see kind controversy able join euro zone? these two completely different issues. the entry european union important decision. once european union, issue stake meet maastricht criteria. a favour strict implementation stability growth pact, favour rigorous implementation maastricht criteria. it’s interest – want enter euro area, euro area itself. the decision recently take european council proposal commission – approve slovenia member euro area - prove euro area close shop. i'm confident progressive enlargement euro area, - fully respect treaty provisions. so, long respect maastricht criteria, limit number euro member countries? no. and know decision make process inside ecb prepare adapt remain efficient, whatever number participant euro area is. after eight, rather – european citizen – five years, would say euro accept the european currency? undoubtedly, yes. the people europe ask u job. they want price stable. achieve that, also best growth job creation. the message clear come every country. we faithful treaty, mandate, people europe. a independent institution accountable people europe. it true country still sentiment price go inflation indicator telling. we share opinion. but case message crystal clear: continue job outmost dedication. bi review 126/2006 5 but common people still doubt accuracy price statistics. that perception nothing euro, course. we full confidence price statistic produce national level process european level correct. the methodology use state art. the ecb still young institution. in area see room improvement? the success euro success

turkey "dollarization: consequence policy options", istanbul, 13-15 december 2006. * * * it pleasure honor participate conference central bank turkey. in first place, pleasure conference central bank time evident monetary policy turkey succeed gradually bring inflation control. inflation around single digit range, give experience country – include israel – struggle subdue inflation, reasonable expect sustain consistent monetary policy, continuation supportive fiscal policy, turkey join inflation target country achieve low single digit inflation. all far cry situation one memorable visit country, february 19, 2001, day spectacular foreign exchange crisis lead shift flexible exchange rate regime begin inflation target approach monetary policy. the turkish economy come long way since then, credit belong central bank successive turkish government – minister senior civil servant – demonstrate ability maintain fiscal discipline continue reform transform economy bring close potential. of course, imf make important contribution success process, i happy member fund fund team, i opportunity work closely turkish authorities. second, honor governor bank israel take part conference important topic dollarization, topic interest central bank turkey, also u bank israel, many central bank economy around world. i start discuss issue full dollarization economy, replacement national currency foreign currency, process take place recent year el salvador ecuador. i go discus must main topic conference – partial dollarization, respect asset liability economy, respect also medium exchange unit account transactions. i. full dollarization during 1990s many economy struggle control stabilize inflation. many use peg exchange rate bring inflation triple digit levels. it power impossible trinity – combination peg exchange rate, free capital movements, monetary policy dedicate domestic goal – become clear, series financial crisis erupted. further, financial crisis decade unfolded, also become evident impossible trinity amend say combination peg exchange rate, free capital movements, macroeconomic policy – monetary policy – dedicate domestic goal possible. the resultant trilemma point three possible directions: one attempt control international capital flows, solution good reason reject countries1; second move flexible exchange rate – though necessarily one totally free-floating; third strengthen exchange rate peg, either adopt currency board, get rid exchange rate entirely, adopt foreign currency, full dollarization. the major benefit third solution see time – emphasize particularly then-colleague michael deppler imf – country adopt solution would 1 among reason capital control tend to: cut development financial sector country global economy; cut economy benefit international trade assets; frequently ineffective source corruption. however, country capital controls, weak macroeconomic framework, vulnerable financial system, need strengthen macroeconomic system financial system liberalize. bi review 126/2006 1 rapidly see benefit enhance credibility monetary policy low interest rates. when one consider instance case turkey, high real interest rate late 1990s run-up crisis create massive fiscal problem2, benefit low interest rate obvious. those benefit see case bulgaria adopt currency board solution, step short full dollarization, see also full dollarization case el salvador ecuador early year decade. they see case country joining, slat join, emu. the benefit instant credibility expect observe also rapid decline inflation rate. that benefit immediately obtain high inflation countries, price continue rise double digit rate nearly three year case ecuador, result extreme real devaluation currency crisis precede dollarization. evidently, balassa-samuelson effect would continue operate – operate strongly – even country adopt currency another country, effect also visible currency board case baltic countries. more generally, adherence currency board full dollarization expect strengthen overall macroeconomic discipline, belief government commit policy would choice maintain fiscal discipline. part reason belief authority would understand macroeconomic effect fail maintain exchange rate peg – one entire financial structure economy dependent – would disastrous. unfortunately, theory withstand unfold argentine crisis. it true collapse long-established relatively long believed-in currency peg extremely expensive argentina. but clear good way deep crisis argentina find end 2001. more generally, use game theory evaluate beneficial effect impose large cost policymakers break commitment – case argentina 1990s – necessary take account expect cost break commitment circumstance arise policymakers nonetheless decide do. the cost even fully credible full dollarization policy also clear: exchange rate long available adjustment mechanism: adjustment could otherwise make allow exchange rate change – natural adjustment mechanism macroeconomic shocks, foreign domestic – transfer domestic price wages. and generally mean painful prolong adjustment. all raise question cost benefit membership monetary union, issue great future importance turkey, one i conclude presentation. ii. partial dollarization in situation partial dollarization, least two currency used, differ extents, perform different function money – unit account, medium exchange, store value.3 for instance, common domestic money use legal tender, foreign currency use unit account transactions, store value – either directly, via various indexation arrangements. in countries, two currency may circulate serve medium exchange different transaction – domestic currency small transactions, foreign currency large transactions, instance real estate. the term "dollarization" generally refer asset liability use within economy, either borrow hold abroad, although impact exchange rate change domestic economy may quite similar two cases. 2 the emphasis imf program primary surplus budget – is, non-interest surplus – extent deflect attention depth turkey's fiscal problem time. 3 in section i draw paper present book edit adriano armas, alain ize, eduardo levy yeyati, financial dollarization: the policy agenda, international monetary fund, 2006. 2 bi review 126/2006 typically partial dollarization result period economic instability past, generally period high inflation. in circumstances, economic agent want hold safe assets4, economic political system produce them. that do allow bank system offer foreign currency, exchange-rate-linked, accounts; bank system turn want lend similar form. dollarization typically long life, generally survive long period instability give rise phenomenon. it useful distinguish four type dollarization: (i) asset dollarization; (ii) liability dollarization; (iii) medium exchange dollarization foreign currency use transactions; (iv) unit account dollarization, future payment index exchange rate. the last sometimes call "real" dollarization. asset liability dollarization the key question arise whether different type partial dollarization contribute financial vulnerability instability, whether circumstance would desirable le dollarization, so, achieved. we start asset liability dollarization. consider first impact bank system operate two currencies, side balance sheet. it common financial crisis 1990s discover bank think hedge foreign currency liability (or foreign-currency denominate liabilities) lend dollars, fact hedged, non-exporting borrower able repay dollar-denominated loans. indeed, even bank think net long position foreign-exchange denominate assets, sometimes discover deep devaluation devastate balance sheets. thus unless lender cautious evaluate borrowers, partial dollarization severely increase vulnerability bank financial system exchange rate changes. these exchange rate change could drive foreign developments, practice often drive domestically generate shocks, frequently cause fiscal problems. that say: asset liability dollarization make financial system, thus economy, vulnerable exchange rate shocks. there discussion literature whether dollarization help create financial depth. the empirical answer seem uncertain. but one take account economic agent seek safe asset find them, capital control never totally watertight, answer must dollarization help preserve large domestic financial system would otherwise exist. for otherwise much financial system would move offshore. can monetary policy effective heavily dollarized economy? in one write equation exchange, mv = py, seem monetary policy get leverage price normal quantity theory mechanisms. but three qualification answer. first, clear relevant m is, whether central bank fully control m. if domestic foreign currency close substitute term matter equation exchange, central bank may effective control m. second, heavily dollarized economies, fiscal policy likely problematic, make difficult monetary policy avoid difficulty associate fiscal dominance. third, question determine interest rate highly dollarized economy. if capital account open, rate return dollarized asset liability economy likely significantly affect foreign interest rates, reduce leverage monetary policy aggregate demand. to extent exchange rate flexible, may leeway foreign domestic interest rates, give monetary policy leverage. although i far distinguish dollarization exchange-rate link asset liabilities, potentially important difference. so long asset liability exchange-rate linked, payable domestic currency, central bank still technically capacity serve lender last resort domestic currency, even without hold massive reserves. but 4 the literature us concept minimum variance portfolio economy, include significant share foreign-currency foreign-currency denominate assets. bi review 126/2006 3 mean impact exchange rate significant financial crisis likely large economy extensive dollarization. empirical work show monetary policy heavily dollarized economy tend aim smooth exchange rate. this surprise give economic agent economy vulnerable exchange rate changes, monetary-policy maker typically also concern stability financial system. in regard, often suggested, correctly, reserve requirement foreign currency liability large domestic currency liabilities, especial care need take evaluate risk associate foreign currency assets. however, also case difficult become hold foreign-currency asset domestic bank system, asset likely hold outside bank system, quite possibly abroad – words, action limit extent dollarization may well contribute capital flight. why simply fix exchange rate? we already discuss issue, head full dollarization. it done, small economies, one – candidate entry emu – know ultimately exit fix exchange rate arrangement. but also dangerous course action country might one day find change exchange rate. there evidence provision price-indexed financial asset help reduce extent dollarization. that make considerable sense, since underlie issue asset-holders increase safety portfolios. generally country suffer high inflation, empirically mean also unstable inflation, provide range assets, include price- foreign-exchange index assets. but extensive price level indexation, like dollarization exchange-rate indexation, may also complicate response economy shocks. medium exchange dollarization i discus issue detail, except note use foreign exchange make large payment may tax- medium-of-exchange related. "real" indexation – unit account dollarization long country return price stability, even disappearance almost asset liability dollarization, country may still find domestic price specify dollars. this currently situation israel. during course nineties, financial dollarization decline dramatically israel. for present decade average inflation rate around two percent. nonetheless, house apartment rentals, fee services, include lawyer accountants, quote dollars. these fundamentally non-traded goods. this mean exchange rate change israel, price import change, fee gradually price level, way economies, also local-currency price significant part price index react also immediately. house account 20 percent cpi. empirical estimate show exchange rate change fee domestic price level within matter months, pass-through coefficient one-third. because exchange rate volatile relative good prices, month-to-month inflation israel also relatively volatile. this complicate monetary policy. we inflation targeters, inflation target 1-3 percent. but give volatility oil price exchange rate, find difficult stay within range. just last two months, result fall price oil weaken dollar, price level fell 1.5 percentage points. that ensure well target inflation range year, inflation likely end year zero. that major problem give economy grow fast, would course prefer within target range. a is, adopt flexible inflation target approach, aim return within inflation range horizon one year. this approach seem gain considerable credibility. further, rapid pass-through exchange rate inflation sometimes make monetary policy easy – change interest rate exchange rate react rapidly, transmission mechanism monetary policy fast. so tight exchange rate-inflation link 4 bi review 126/2006 problem, sometimes benefit. but average, inflation rate react rapidly every external shock move exchange rate. we would prefer slow pass-through exchange rate prices, inflation rate could stable. and fact remain economy continue pay price, term inflation volatility, period high inflation bring control twenty year ago: inflation consequences, among dollarization, long-lasting effects. iii. what do? give dollarization complicate economic management, contribute uncertainty ensure continuation, natural want get rid phenomenon. that certainly worthwhile goal dollarization extensive. at time, fundamentally stable economy, good reason prevent people hold asset want enter contract want. the first thing reduce level dollarization get macroeconomic framework shape. that mean particular put fiscal policy sustainable track. and also mean develop monetary policy framework. for open economy framework one inflation targeting, exchange rate flexibility. a macroeconomic situation stabilizes, turkey, extent dollarization – particularly asset liability dollarization – expect start declining. for long time seem extent asset liability dollarization impervious improve economic performance. that certainly impression one look latin american developments, instance bolivia stabilize hyperinflation mid-1980s, bank system continue 80 percent dollarized present century. now however several example country dedollarized successfully asset liability sides, include israel, poland, mexico, egypt, turkey. and sign decline dollarization evident latin american country seem dollarization impossible reverse. could legal restriction dollarization speed process dedollarization? effectively implemented, could. but route try precondition macroeconomic stability place. and restriction likely difficult enforce. this may especially case unit account dollarization, people likely find way contract prefer unit despite law. over long run, normal condition restored, possible permit freedom individual institution operate financial asset liability prefer. just case price level indexation, macroeconomic environment stabilized, index foreign currency instrument introduce without destabilize macroeconomy. iv. euroization emu if dollarization, include full dollarization, avoided, join emu? this question turkey ask itself, sooner one hopes, rather later. the answer join emu far-reaching step implement currency board, even decide use foreign currency. for membership emu involve sign host restriction policy, least fiscal policy, design prevent type crisis make full dollarization potentially problematic. further, membership eu facilitate adjustment mechanism – include totally free trade, full capital mobility, considerable labor mobility5 – frequently absent country dollarizes unilaterally. and emu member say determine monetary policy. there still remain fundamental fact country join emu give exchange rate adjustment mechanism. country flexible wage price adjust good 5 the extent labor mobility major issue turkey join eu, case bulgaria romania. bi review 126/2006 5 le flexibility, present performance turkey likely advantage regard. to set problem perspective, need remember state unite state also give exchange rate adjustment mechanism, manage adjust shock quite well. but point discuss topic next central bank turkey conference – make best benefit join eu emu – i would like conclude thank host invitation hospitality, wish turkey every success continue impressive economic development. thank you. 6 bi review 126/2006 savenaca narube:

academic year, university rome “la sapienza”, economic faculty, rome, 9 november 2006. * * * 1. education development italy set path rapid development second world war keep quarter-century. a substantial part country’s disadvantage respect high level economic welfare make good. although mark sometimes acute social tension distributive conflicts, growth benefit several domestic external factor make extremely large productivity gains. increase resources, largely underutilized agricultural sector, employ sector high output per worker, complete transition industrial economy. this unprecedented rapid sustain growth accompany progressive rise educational level population fit nicely state technological knowledge. since 1990s inrush emerge economy international market advent new information communication technologies, biotechnology thin material technology radically alter characteristic global economic development. they create new hierarchies, revolutionize production process and, especially advance countries, thoroughly modify characteristic labour input demand firms. the ample strand economic literature investigate connection education development gain new vigour. broadly speaking, level education carry decisive weight explain process economic growth two fundamental angles. one concern improvement knowledge apply production: human capital formation fuel efficiency production drive remuneration labour factor production. this engine growth become still important phase characterize rapid technical progress. in 1960s edmund phelps observe acquisition advance knowledge essential condition innovation adapt new technologies. the endowment human capital assume crucial value transcend benefit first instance: promote generation diffusion new idea impart impetus technical progress; improve earn prospect and, close virtuous circle, increase incentive investment human capital. a primary source accumulation type capital, educational system produce major externality help raise growth prospect entire economy. this one interest insight “new” theory endogenous growth. accord estimates, social return education high private returns; is, exceed extra benefit enjoy individual good education. but externality - come second angle - limit sphere production narrow sense; also affect social context contribute economic growth way well. this aspect analyze mainly connection develop countries, course apply advance society too. for time economic think - alone - underscore property efficiency market economy cannot consider ignore “social capital”, define body institutions, social norm trust reciprocity formal informal network relation foster collective action resource create welfare. at aggregate level social capital, distinct human capital, nevertheless connected, factor human, social economic development. it system share value guarantee sense responsibility commitment enter party conclude contract. these value constitute trait national

mid-1990s, annual increase labour productivity italy one percentage point le average oecd countries. this underlie cause present crisis affect country’s growth competitiveness. the rapid rise employment foster recent year wage moderation, regularization many immigrant worker labour market reform produce natural, expected, slowdown rate productivity growth. on top this, however, overall efficiency economy deteriorated, evidence recent decline total factor productivity, instance industrialize world. the situation render even worry demographic scenario next decades. accord current projections, despite take account large migratory flows, working-age population set decrease dramatically, act brake potential growth italian economy. only substantial increase labour market participation return productivity growth reverse trends. raise population’s average level education improve quality prerequisite achievement objectives. although significant progress make past decade, labour market participation rate italy still well european average, particularly among women, young people old age groups. a high level education tend narrow gaps. in oecd countries, average rate employment university-educated men age 25 64 15 percentage point high peer lower-secondary-school qualification; women, difference 30 points. the fact people high level education likely work reflect increase propensity participate labour market and, case adults, small risk unemployment. the bank italy’s economic research department estimate that, thing equal, italy probability participate labour market increase 2.4 percentage point every year school attendance. in south, figure rise 3.2 points, reflect great relative scarcity skilled workers. all highlight important contribution towards overcome country’s geographical dualism could make policy raise educational level south. a high level education also best way minimize risk fragment career path job loss, become press past spread fixed-term employment contracts. the high professional qualification, great incentive firm invest stable last employment great likelihood worker find another job quickly present one unsatisfactory threaten adverse events. high level education bring gain productivity. the relationship gauge roughly link educational qualification earnings, personal return education. in majority oecd countries, people qualification equivalent specialist university degree earn least 50 per cent worker secondary school diploma. the wage differential worker diploma worker low secondary school certificate range 15 30 per cent. in italy individuals’ return education low oecd average; nonetheless, return give investment education, even take associate cost fully account, much high alternative investments. 2 bi review 125/2006 a poor level education affect evolution productivity inability exploit opportunity offer rapid technical progress. it recently, late italy elsewhere, organization production begin benefit extensive use information technology, good train essential. among highly develop countries, italy stand anomalous static model specialization, predominant industry mark medium low level human-capital. it model consistent relatively small endowment highly skilled manpower. in new technological competitive environment drag economy down, prevent penetrate today’s dynamic innovative branch expose fierce competition emerge countries. another crucial condition overcome static model presence managerial skill capable reshape production processes, exploit technologies, reallocate resources. the widespread availability skill achieve high level education; inevitably accompany great contestability firms’ ownership. 3. what kind education? in course twentieth century italy’s school university sustain nation’s economic growth civil progress. they become le elite progressively open society large. give education million previously exclude citizen reduce inequality time make difficult attain high standard achievement. over decades, national school university reform measure respond partially emerge need bring grow student population high level education, essential today give transformation labour market advance countries. the education deficit remain worrisome, italy’s lateness commence mass education unfavourable demographic dynamics. notwithstanding significant gain young people’s level educational attainment, 2005 37.5 per cent italian age 25 64 upper secondary diplomas, nearly 8 percentage point oecd average. and gap share university graduate wide still: scarcely 12 per cent italy, half oecd average. because fast age italian population, share young people one low anywhere world. the consequence gain make young generation limit impact average level educational attainment. too many adolescent still abandon studies, stay school hard time learn peer rest europe. in 2004 76 every 100 young people graduation age get upper secondary diplomas, one low percentage among advance countries. the oecd’s periodic survey find end compulsory school italian youngster rank near bottom mathematical achievement, fall year behind student elsewhere. perhaps come surprise, consider decline number mathematics physic student universities. nor result discipline provide much consolation. the share italian student whose read comprehension inadequate significantly high european average. these unsatisfactory average result compound significant regional disparities, disadvantage student south italy, great variability school school. the dispersion achievement test result 15-year-olds among high oecd countries. even context overwhelmingly public school system, level education income student’s family remain decisive. if quality school differentiate informational transparency lacking, “educated” parent able guide child best class capable teachers. our problem stem shortage public resource allocate school system. indeed, italy’s spend primary secondary education high per student oecd average, high teacher salary due high teacher/student ratios. italy 9.4 teacher every 100 student secondary school 9.2 elementary schools, oecd average 7.4 6.1 european average 8.5 6.8. the high ratio italy depend part social policy choices, widespread use tutor special student local provision educational service small geographically scatter communities. even take factor account, however, disparity country remain substantial, reflect among bi review 125/2006 3 thing fragmentation subject studied, difference translate good academic results. organizational shortcoming poor motivation staff significant factors. the magnitude effect produce economic growth increase average educational level vary type instruction promoted. the effective enhance occupational mobility worker and, all, spread new ideas. in unite state broad diffusion basic knowledge fit well acceleration technical progress, help increase america’s lead growth country continental europe. technical vocational school highly specialize course long-established roots, notably germany, sustain economic social development since turn twentieth century. they arise age definition skill much narrowly circumscribe stable now, base relatively fix work procedure standard knowledge. today widely perceive need extensive revision mission schools, great need knowledge adapt technological context whose boundary good deal le well define constantly shifting. without deny important role technical vocational school still play economic system, school could orient learn general skill aptitudes, also encourage student proceed high level education. this lead u brief discussion universities. in italy proportion people age 25 34 university degree still average main industrial countries, despite significant increase recent year follow university reform 2002. the university drop-out rate 60 per cent, nearly twice average lead countries. the proportion graduate go earn postgraduate qualification small, italy fourth bottom rank oecd countries. the bulk recent increase number graduate consist student short course. in last two year matriculants converge law political social sciences. more generally, international standard study course italian university student appear bias towards humanity social science away technical scientific subjects. part difference due fact that, contrast italy, shorter-course university degree country mainly technical subjects. but another part explanation find high rent enjoy professions, distort families’ choices, firms’ insufficient demand high technical scientific qualifications. few public resource allocate high education italy many advance countries. this flip side large volume resource allocate primary secondary education. the basic political choice privilege early education detriment investment advance knowledge. this far-sighted choice world innovation key growth. the public resource allocate high education italy appear even small compare make available anglo-saxon university systems, despite great many private institutions. the manner intervene different, however: unite states, example, mainly form direct finance deserve student family scholarship personal loans; italy, rest continental europe, bulk fund serve finance universities. 4. look ahead by nobody italy doubt urgent need revive economic growth. the present lively cyclical upturn certainly sufficient trigger rapid solution structural defect italy’s productive system. for reason i try set here, education one important aspect reform strategy aim alter context system operates. in modern economy public sector organize regulate market, produce public good correct externalities. in case education, principle need apply take account sector’s specific feature complexity. 4 bi review 125/2006 an effective education policy must reconcile excellence fair distribution opportunity go learn desire level. these two objective conflict, provide public sphere seek create equal opportunity choose operational option allow market play part select excellence. scholastic success depend significantly condition pupils’ families. from point view italy appear socially almost immobile. the probability earn degree depend quality precede education, sometimes inadequate, italy today, family’s socio-economic background play major role. too little change respect since don milani raise question forty year ago, albeit another context, light experience child school barbiana. give young people opportunity succeed learning, provide apply themselves, key increase efficiency fairness field education. both objective pursue variety complementary ways. in primary secondary education may worth increase competition schools, public private, method finance reward best school transfer resource directly family order give choice. the information guide family choice school appear insufficient. in addition prospect obtain diploma value everybody, offer uniform assessment criterion permit inform choices. it necessary eliminate perverse incentive family school collude low teach standards, especially finance continue depend exclusively number student enrolled. the first step towards develop comprehensive assessment system already incorporate italian legislation deserve follow others, least permit good inform guidance public action govern reform school system. somewhat similar consideration apply universities, essential institution economy wish retain place among advance countries. in recent year important change make italian university system. for first time assessment make quality research. notwithstanding measurement problem involved, could shortly use guide public finance individual universities. it important work do turn miss opportunity. transparency public access assessment process help improve comparison university permit good inform choice students, especially le access channel provide great wealth information. it hop first series measure stimulate competition among universities, increase incentive raise standard research instruction selection university teachers. in school high education, explicit recognition merit avoid mortification talented, provide accompany measure support deserve poor students. the recognition merit guarantee equity absence undoubtedly mean society le fair accentuate discrimination cause difference start conditions; time society poor waste resources. i convince succeed renew unity intent alone bring advance italian education, unity provide foundation

arabian monetary agency bank operate kingdom, namely, "banker" program. i would like take opportunity thank participate bank institute bank support effort organize execute ambitious program aim meet grow need bank sector qualify job-seekers saudi youth. a know, bank sector witness past year accelerate development due economic growth see kingdom saudi arabia. these development pose great challenge bank financial institution expedite provision diversification financial service meet increase need domestic market. the development financial institution must, undoubtedly, parallel development human resources. this, turn, require plan train qualify cadre enable financial institution undertake important role serve national economy. since inception, sama support bank develop human resource establish institute banking, contribute train qualify large number national cadre financial service sector. the institute continue professionally exercise role make effort cope development financial bank sector provide information solution diverse educational program consistent individual bank needs. the institute's program cover important bank fields, treasury, investment credit, contribute effectively develop qualify national cadres. thus, saudization bank sector exceed 85 percent end first half 2006. dear audience, these developments, diversify expand service provide saudi market, give rise substantial challenge financial institutions. one important challenge provide sufficient number qualify human resource meet need institutions. despite employment effort make bank cope expansion, though 4,246 employee appoint first half 2006, total need institution still satisfied. hence, sama promptly exert expeditious effort search solution challenges. to end, instruct institute bank study situation propose practical solution help bank bridge gap short long terms. the "banker" program come solution complementary study program arrange educational institutions, parallel banks' direct effort attract employ national cadres. we gather today celebrate open first course integrate program, hopefully provide financial institution need human resources, offer good job opportunity youth homeland. in conclusion, i reiterate thank contribute accomplish "banker" program, i hope continue successfully achieve objective established. thank listening. bi review 125/2006 1 caleb m fundanga:

bernanke: the chinese economy – progress challenge remark mr ben s bernanke, chairman board governor u federal reserve system, chinese academy social sciences, beijing, 15 december 2006. * * * the emergence china global economic power one important development recent decades. for past twenty years, chinese economy achieve growth rate average nearly 10 percent per year, result quintuple output per person. in overall size, china's economy today rank fourth large world term gross domestic product (gdp) current exchange rate second large adjustment make difference domestic purchase power national currencies. this strong economic performance result improve live standard chinese people. by estimates, 200 million chinese bring poverty since reform begin 1978.1 moreover, 2004 life expectancy birth china reach seventy-one years, infant mortality rate fall 26 per 1,000 live births, literacy rate age fifteen reach 90 percent.2 these remarkable accomplishments. nonetheless, measure china remain develop nation.3 in particular, although life urban center typical modern, affluent society, average household income consumption remain quite low rural inland areas. thus, china face double challenge sustain high stable overall rate economic growth stimulate economic development part country share le fully economic boom. in remark today, i would like offer think china continue prosper promote economic welfare people. economic progress: market productivity economist agree important determinant live standard country average level productivity, output per worker. on score well, china's record recent decade excellent. between 1978, open door policy reform began, 1989, output per employ person china grow vigorously, estimate average rate 6-1/2 percent per year. however, 1990 2005, productivity grow even impressive rate 9 percent per year.4 many factor contribute strong productivity performance, include high rate capital investment, increase openness trade, strengthen educational system.5 however, view, single important cause ongoing expansion productivity china moved, gradually steadily, away central plan toward great reliance markets. in 1978, almost price china determine market, production control direct state. since then, government reduce direct intervention economy scale back state-owned enterprises, process allow scope market forces. by 1999, accord one estimate, 95 percent retail business, together 80 percent trade agricultural commodity producer goods, conduct market-determined prices.6 1 bergsten others ( 2006), p. 3. 2 world bank (2006). 3 for example, accord 2005 data international monetary fund's world economic outlook database, china's per caput gdp one-sixth unite state purchasing-power-parity basis one twenty-fifth unite state current exchange rates. 4 productivity growth rate calculate federal reserve board staff use chinese data output employment. productivity difficult measure, figure treat approximate. a new method survey employment introduce 1990, result break series year. 5 see, example, chapter 2 bergsten others (2006) discussion china grow rapidly. 6 lardy (2002), p. 25. bi review 124/2006 1 substantial experience show modern economies, include early stage development, complex manage effectively centralize basis. price set free competitive market serve several critical functions, among aggregate disparate information supply demand condition relative scarcity specific good services; direct resource productive uses; provide incentive engage cost reduction, innovation, entrepreneurial activities. a free market labor particularly critical sustain economic development. china make substantial progress area past decades, notably reduce barrier movement worker among regions, sectors, firm allow great flexibility determination employment wages.7 indeed, ongoing movement worker relatively low-productivity, low-wage job agriculture higher-productivity, higher-wage job manufacture service significant source chinese economic growth. the decline share population rural areas, 80 percent 1970 le 60 percent 2005, indicate scale movement labor agriculture recent decades. despite shifts, difference labor productivity among sector remain large. for example, 2005, estimate output per worker agriculture relate sector $800, whereas industry manufacturing, utilities, mining, output per worker $5,900, seven time much.8 moreover, considerable portion china's labor force (specifically, agriculture inefficient state-owned enterprises) remain underutilized. thus, substantial additional gain productivity economy whole might realize reallocation labor force productive grow sectors. in particular, small- medium-sized enterprise emerge engine job creation china - unite state - even promote innovation help create dynamic diversify economy. the government support process reallocate labor productive us continue reduce barrier labor mobility, help worker obtain education train need productive new occupations, encourage entrepreneurship small-business development. a significant reallocation labor among sector been, improvement productivity recent year result increase efficiency within major sector rather reallocation resource sectors. here again, market competition play vital role. in particular, open economy international trade investment, accelerate since china's accession world trade organization 2001, do much harness market force service country's development. exposure competition global marketplace force chinese producer - alone partnership foreign firm - increase efficiency improve quality output. notably, globally-engaged firm (or affiliates) operate china help foster productivity growth country introduce new technology managerial techniques, well enhance domestic competition. although expansion market-based portion economy yield impressive results, gain could achieve allow still great scope market forces. the energy sector present one opportunity. a know, china's appetite energy grow rapidly: china's consumption oil rise 50 percent since 2000, international energy agency estimate chinese oil usage increase 400,000 barrel per day 2006, represent nearly half year's growth world oil demand. this rapid expansion energy use reflect overall economic growth relatively energy-intensive pattern development. great use market price energy sector, include elimination remain price control fuel liberalization electricity prices, would support cleaner, sustainable economic growth promote more-efficient use energy household firm encourage development new energy supplies.9 7 brook (2004) provide detail labor market development china recent years. 8 calculation use current exchange rate base output employment data national bureau statistic china chinese state statistical office; data chinese national source obtain ceic database. 9 the adverse effect poor household eliminate price control fuel would best deal direct cash grants. 2 bi review 124/2006 significant benefit could also obtain allow large role market force guide investment decisions. china's economic growth owe much extraordinary share gdp devote investment new capital, factories, equipment, office buildings, partly finance large amount business saving.10 however, rapid pace investment growth raise concern whether new capital deploy productive ways. in particular, analyst question whether china get adequate return investment. for example, 1990 2001, fix investment share gdp china average 33 percent, economy grow annual rate 10 percent. between 2001 2005, fix investment's share gdp rise 40 percent, economy's average growth rate remain same, suggest low return recent investment. comparison also draw rapid development phase asian countries, south korea japan. average annual growth 9 10 percent south korea 1982-91 period japan 1955-70 period; country relevant year investment's share gdp 30 percent, low china today. in chinese industries, heavy investment continue even sign excess capacity begin appear - another possible indication capital misallocation. an example steel industry, excess capacity appear triple 2002 2005 reach 115 million metric tons.11 allow competitive financial market play large role allocation capital would likely increase return investment reduce risk uneconomic investment could exacerbate problem nonperforming loan contribute future financial instability. base investment decision market signal also take good account cost input complementary capital, labor (relatively abundant china) energy (relatively scarce).12 china take initial step toward great reliance market determine allocation investment - example, authorize begin liberalize stock market. china also strengthen bank system improve supervision, confront enormous problem nonperforming loans, allow domestic institution partner foreign banks, increase use market-based criterion bank lending. these trend positive; however, great deal remain done, include broaden range financial instrument available saver borrowers; take step ensure credit evaluation extension base sound economic criteria; increase competition bank finance; improve credit availability consumer small firms; remove remain control interest rates; eliminate use quantitative administrative measure influence amount composition capital investment. finally, capital market require appropriate institutional foundation function effectively: well-defined property right (including intellectual property rights), transparent account standards, good corporate governance, effective supervisory oversight bank markets, consistent enforcement contracts, rule allow orderly bankruptcy proceed unprofitable firm help support efficient investment. china make progress develop critical institutions, continue focus area would provide large economic benefit long run. macroeconomic policy move microeconomics macroeconomics, i believe china could benefit improve tool manage economy - notably, monetary fiscal policies. effective use macroeconomic policy tool help achieve low stable inflation increase economic stability moderate effect growth temporary fluctuation global domestic demand. stable economic condition reduce important source risk consequently promote innovation growth. a central banker, i focus remark development monetary policy.13 10 world bank researcher conclude business save finance majority business investment china (kuijs, 2005). some question (shan, 2006). for discussion issue involve debate, see hoffman kuijs (2006). 11 base production capacity data provide national bureau statistics. 12 market-based allocation capital take account environmental external effects, unless additional mechanism tradable pollution permit employed. 13 goodfriend prasad (2006) provide good description bank financial system china issue regard implementation monetary policy. bi review 124/2006 3 the people's bank china (pboc), nation's central bank, capable well-respected around world. however, monetary policy work well extent financial market sufficiently develop allow monetary authorities' interest-rate decision affect economic activity reasonably predictable way. the development reliable "monetary transmission mechanism" thus another reason reform strengthen china's bank financial markets. the interest-sensitive borrow investment decision are, monetary policy affect investment aggregate demand without need quantitative controls. moreover, fund allocate market principles, project expect risk-adjusted return high relevant market rate interest undertaken. thus, example, central bank raise interest rates, market ensure result slow investment bear least promise projects, without need official make judgments. the effectiveness monetary policy would also enhance great flexibility exchange rate. to maintain current close link renminbi (rmb) dollar presence capital inflow (arising china's trade surplus foreign purchase rmb-denominated assets), pboc must intervene exchange market buy dollar rmb. increase domestic money supply result unless central bank offset effect purchase money supply sell bond investors, primarily commercial banks, exchange rmb - procedure commonly refer "sterilization." if dollar purchase central bank routinely sterilized, money supply might increase desired, possibly lead overheat economy inflation. to date pboc largely successful sterilization operations, continue use strategy eventually encounter problems. if exchange rate domestic interest rate maintain near current levels, incentive capital inflow - thus need continue intervention sterilization - remain undiminished. accordingly, value outstanding sterilization bond continue grow rapidly. these bond could substitute asset might hold bank private investors, potentially interfere growth development private financial markets. further, perception rmb undervalue (a point i return) fuel additional capital inflows, investor expect earn capital gain rmb ultimately appreciates. however, speculative inflow increase need exchange-market intervention sterilization. in long term, continue growth modernization chinese economy require substantial loosen current restriction flow financial capital country. however, fluctuation value rmb remain limit within narrow range, permit substantial capital mobility would almost entirely eliminate pboc's capacity use monetary policy stabilize domestic economy, excess chinese dollar interest rates, example, would trigger large capital inflows. further appreciation rmb, combine wide trade band ultimate goal market-determined exchange rate, would allow effective independent monetary policy thereby help enhance china's future growth stability. from institutional perspective, china may find - many country do - grant great autonomy central bank, insulate degree short-term political concerns, increase ability ensure price stability support stable growth. of course, central bank must remain accountable government long term. trade, capital flows, transition domestically-led growth a central component china's development strategy openness trade capital inflows. for example, value good export import currently equal two-thirds china's gdp, high level country china's geographic size. china's accession world trade organization (wto) particularly effective stimulate trade: since join wto 2001, china see dollar value export grow average rate 30 percent per year, compare annual growth 12-1/2 percent five year gain wto membership. china currently account 7-1/2 percent world exports, 1-1/2 percent 1985. about half china's trade so-called process trade; is, component material import (mostly asian countries), process assembly do china, finish product re-exported. much economic research show openness trade promote 4 bi review 124/2006 growth.14 trade support growth classical principle comparative advantage, also effect trade intensity market competition, transfer technology knowledge, factors. china also prove successful attract capital inflows, particularly foreign direct investment (fdi). the flow fdi china increase $2 billion 1986 $72 billion 2005, make country third large recipient fdi world, unite kingdom unite states.15 fdi benefit china's development bring new technologies, products, business methods.16 the flow foreign investment chinese security also increase significantly, reach $22 billion 2005. a know, china today run substantial trade current account surpluses. these external surplus cause part china's remarkably high save rate.17 because china's national save rate even high rate domestic investment, country excess fund lend global capital market; follow balance-of-payments account china's net lend abroad (or acquisition foreign assets) equal country's current account surplus. a large portion lend finance foreigners' purchase chinese net export (the trade surplus). high household save correspond low level consumption china contribute trade surplus depress demand import force domestic firm look abroad markets. together large trade current account deficit unite states, chinese external surplus contribute current pattern global imbalances, many economist policymakers argue unsustainable long run. the chinese leadership recognize importance encourage import achieve great balance china's international trade, recently include objective five-year plan 2006-2010. in view, would china's achieve small external balance contribute global financial stability, would also china's economic interest. although china's extensive participation global trade financial system invaluable country's development, ultimate purpose economic growth improve live standard home. today, half china's gdp devote investment produce net export rest world, thus remain half available consumption, include government consumption. in particular, household consumption china last year 38 percent gdp, 45 percent 2001. in comparison, household consumption 60 percent gdp india 2004, accord recent available data. china's low share consumption gdp is, course, counterpart high national save rate. policy aim increase household consumption would clearly benefit chinese people, notably improve standard live allow fruit economic development share widely. such policies, reduce save increase imports, would also serve reduce china's current account trade surpluses.18 put great reliance domestic demand rather net export drive growth would also decrease china's vulnerability fluctuation global demand. how china direct great share output domestic consumption? again, increase flexibility exchange rate could help. a chinese trade surplus continue widen, many analyst conclude rmb undervalued.19 indeed, situation likely worsen recently; rmb's link dollar, trade-weighted effective real exchange rate 14 see, example, sachs warner (1995), frankel romer (1999), wacziarg (2001). 15 in 2005, unite kingdom surpass china unite state large recipient fdi world. in 2004, china rank second unite states. 16 for discussion relationship fdi economic growth china, see zebregs (2002). 17 china's national save rate 41 percent 2003 47 percent 2005, accord imf figures. a 2003, late date detail data available, household account 42 percent domestic saving, firm (including state-owned enterprises) government account 36 percent 22 percent domestic saving, respectively (national bureau statistic china, 2006). 18 see lardy (2006), example, careful discussion need reorientation chinese growth toward consumption. 19 see, example, goldstein (2004) anderson (2006). dunaway others (2006) provide useful analysis sensitivity chinese equilibrium real exchange rate alternative approach assumption commonly used. bi review 124/2006 5 fall 10 percent past five years.20 allow rmb strengthen would make import consumer good (as well capital goods) china le expensive. great scope market force determine value rmb would also reduce important distortion chinese economy, namely, effective subsidy undervalue currency provide chinese firm focus export rather produce domestic market. a decrease effective subsidy would induce firm gear production toward home market, benefit domestic consumer firms. reduce implicit subsidy export could increase long-term financial stability well: if china invest heavily export industry whose economic viability depend undervaluation exchange rate, future appreciation rmb could lead excess capacity industries, result low return increase nonperforming loans. although flexibility exchange rate would helpful, direct probably effective way reduce external surplus increase welfare chinese household take measure reduce domestic save relative domestic investment.21 why domestic save high present? the high save rate households, even poor households, likely reflect relatively thin "social safety net" china. for example, 14 percent population cover health insurance, pension plan (which, case, replace 20 percent pre-retirement earnings) apply 16 percent economically active population.22 combine expenditure central government local government education, health, pension relief, social security amount 4 percent gdp, low country similar income levels. in absence strong social safety net, chinese household save high rate protect risk unexpected medical expense poverty old age. a sustain program expand social service potential reduce save raise live standard china and, time, moderate china's external surpluses. in particular, increase government spend health, education, type social service would raise household consumption government consumption, thus reduce national saving. a one mean help fund increase social expenditures, state-owned enterprise could require pay large dividend government, measure i understand currently consideration. financial reform increase access household mortgages, private insurance, form consumer finance would also support high rate consumption. a i noted, chinese leadership make reduce trade current account surplus important policy objective. further, recognize achieve goal would greatly facilitate increase consumption social safety net, government institute propose various reduction tax increase social spending. the government also announce effort raise live standard rural inland areas. obviously, early judge success initiatives. however, effort constructive deserve support. conclusion a i discuss today, china make remarkable economic progress since reform begin 1978. great use markets, together expand trade capital flows, help increase growth output productivity, turn increase live standard significantly. a still-greater reliance markets, particularly allocate capital investment, would contribute continuation strong economic growth. further development macroeconomic policy tool would also support healthy growth keep inflation low increase economic stability. china also face significant risk imbalances. the principal risk arise likelihood capital allocate efficiently possible, result undervalue exchange rate capital market that, despite positive steps, remain distort underdeveloped. misallocated capital pay high possible returns, lead potentially slow growth future financial stress. in addition, monetary policy may constrain lack reliable monetary 20 the estimate federal reserve board staff period november 2001 november 2006. 21 kuijs (2006) document source composition save investment china. 22 bergsten others (2006), p.28. 6 bi review 124/2006 transmission mechanism relative inflexibility exchange rate, inhibit central bank's ability keep inflation low stabilize economy. the principal imbalance lie composition chinese gdp, heavily tilt toward investment net export away domestic consumption government provision social services. a good balance would improve welfare chinese people (by increase consumption social services) would increase global financial stability (by reduce china's current account trade surpluses). the chinese government undertake reduce imbalance take measure expand domestic demand, especially household consumption, i hope effort successful. china's development open global economy also benefit unite state many ways. china second-largest source u.s. imports; import boost u.s. real income allow u.s. household purchase consumption good u.s. firm purchase intermediate input low cost. china also grow market investment export u.s. firms. since china join wto, u.s. export china doubled. a china

global imbalances, i discuss mean china reduce contribution imbalance encourage domestic consumption. the unite state must also part, particular increase rate national save avoid protectionism. with

blattner: global trend financial market infrastructure significance financial stability introductory remark mr niklaus blattner, vice-chairman govern board swiss national bank, end-of-year medium news conference, zurich, 14 december 2006. * * * development bank financial market subject extensive daily medium analysis commentary. by contrast, financial market infrastructures, i.e. stock exchanges, payment security settlement systems, rarely make headlines. i decide shift focus today concentrate financial market infrastructures. in particular, i wish highlight interest global trend ass trend impact stability financial system. internationalisation financial market infrastructure traditionally, financial market infrastructure strong national focus. this make sense long financial market also strong domestic focus. however, deregulation liberalisation financial market associate increase cross-border financial flow result widen gap financial market financial market infrastructures, latter remain constrain within national bounds. more internationalisation financial market infrastructure become inevitable order avoid loss competitiveness due inefficiencies. this process open market infrastructure still continue today. we differentiate different type internationalisation. first, direct access infrastructure use reserve exclusively domestic participant grant frequently foreign participant well. swiss interbank clearing, example, admit participant abroad since late 1990s. second, consolidation infrastructure full swing, especially europe. in cases, consolidation take place merger formerly independent systems. for example, euroclear group integrate formerly independent central security depository netherlands, belgium, france uk. in instances, consolidation take le direct form. national infrastructure may, example, set mutual link facilitate trade, i.e. settlement cross-border transactions. the internationalisation stock market also make possible trade increase number stock several different trade platforms. and finally, also witness emergence completely new infrastructure adopt international – case even global – focus outset. a classic example continuous link settlement (cls) system, design settlement foreign exchange transaction start operation four year ago. it settle transaction many 15 currencies. but open trade centre settlement channels, traditionally domestic focus, impact financial stability? on one hand, obvious adjustment financial market infrastructure special feature global financial market may contribute reduce risk relate settlement cross-border transactions. for example, risk associate traditional foreign exchange transaction settlement (herstatt risk) largely eliminate cls. on hand, grow interconnection internationalisation infrastructure result new kind transmission channel (often cross-border), credit liquidity problem individual market participant spread participants. in new environment, operational problem experience within individual financial market infrastructure also spread much rapidly large number players. a work group currently deal precisely issues. it set committee payment settlement system (cpss) bank international settlement (bis) one participant snb. what already clear advantage internationalisation clearly outweigh drawback far. any threat financial stability would counter modification systems’ architecture, applicable rule oversight. bi review 123/2006 1 tentative adjustment market development while financial market infrastructure internationalise quite rapidly, repeatedly lag behind deregulation financial markets. in today’s environment, possible innovative financial product gain popularity quickly achieve enormous trade volume shortly introduction. a recent example rapid growth market credit derivatives. while trade volume credit derivative absolutely explode last decade, efficiency transaction confirmation settlement process long time leave much desired. a consequence, backlog concluded, yet unconfirmed transaction grow steadily. this development result high risks, since failure confirm transaction jeopardise enforceability, i.e. possibility net transactions. this, turn, lead financial intermediary incorrectly measure control market counterparty risks. in aforementioned example relate credit derivatives, u federal reserve lead bank supervisor intervene year ago oblige market participant rapidly reduce confirmation backlog promote introduction efficient cross-sector procedures. market participant focus exclusively lucrative trade aspect future innovations, must also speed development convince solution process new transactions. otherwise, financial stability jeopardised. financial market infrastructure bank increasingly share role differentiate traditional financial market infrastructure bank – straightforward 20 year ago – become increasingly difficult. on one hand, major international banks, particular, provide service one would normally allocate financial market infrastructures. for instance, customer base large possible conclude settle trade order outside stock exchange. the hold true settlement payment transactions: large bank, payment settle directly systems. these ‘in-house systems’ compete actual interbank payment system, especially banks’ customer bank themselves. on hand, operator financial market infrastructure expand core business banks. for example, number central security depository participant provide loan liquidity facilities. although do primarily facilitate settlement security transactions, line demarcation traditional financial intermediation become increasingly blurred. also, grant remote access establish efficient connection individual central security depositories, offer serious competition traditional custodians. technological progress drive force behind blur role financial market infrastructure banks. technology enable large bank break operational field infrastructure operator without much additional expenditure. indeed, virtually oblige so, order utilise it platform full capacity run efficiently. on demand side, small financial institution also benefit. a outsource back office function large bank specialise institutions, good focus core business. the infrastructure operators, turn, find situation hardly anyone will pay traditional transaction service take commodity character. consequently, diversify provide service generate high add value. those infrastructure operator organise profit-oriented public companies, particular, likely intensify competition bank future. this development confront regulator new challenges. many supervisory oversight authority still pursue institution-based approach. in words, apply different criterion functions, depend whether function exercise bank, one hand, stock exchange central security depository, other. furthermore, bank financial market infrastructure mostly supervise oversee different authorities. the apply switzerland. this bring risk regulatory difference deliberately exploited. the question whether financial market regulation need focus function rather institution limit regulatory arbitrage would examined. regulation would base legal status institution function actually exercised. 2 bi review 123/2006 conclusion the picture i give development field financial market infrastructure mean complete. other development mention tendency nowadays attach great significance measure relate contingency plan crisis management, grow movement towards organise financial market infrastructure profit-oriented public company observe many countries. in europe, particular, pressure consolidate strongly fragment infrastructure environment. this dynamic development challenge operator financial market infrastructure particular. the decision-makers swiss financial market infrastructure – swx swiss exchange, si group telekurs group – also decide want position strategically. this easy task consider stakeholder often pursue differ interests. in addition, various potential conflicts, example objective exploit economy scale much possible – might possible cross-border cooperation – objective maintain independence. bi review 123/2006 3 bi review 123/2006 1 nil bernstein: the role pension sector economy speech mr nil bernstein, chairman board governor national bank denmark, labour-market pension conference 2006, copenhagen, 26 october 2006. * * * 1. introduction thank invite present danmark nationalbank's view role pension sector economy. some perhaps ask danmark nationalbank know pension sector? isn't bite like ask woman football? the women-and-football metaphor own. it take article sector's membership magazine forsikring (insurance) 2002, danmark nationalbank danish economic council voice critical stance nominal interest-rate guarantee pension sector. in article point danmark nationalbank chairmanship ("wise men") economic council comprehensive understand pension system partial analyses. that naturally one way view it, i reject outright. however, even though pension sector core area danmark nationalbank, several interfaces. before i elaborate areas, i would like present perspective pension sector denmark. 2. perspective pension sector the classical danish encyclopaedia, salmonsen, 1923, says: "it formerly believe human life subject valuation consequently could insured. maintenance allowances, particularly life annuities, entirely different matter. unlike life assurance policies, annuity put price human life, therefore sale annuity deem unethical." today, life insurance life annuity integral part pension companies' activities, pension sector important element economy – business deem unethical. the sector's transaction major implication individual citizen, popularity pension save scheme among wage earner self-employed, also due volume asset managed. only 15 year ago, danes' total pension save (via pension companies) amount kr. 350 billion, equivalent 40 per cent gdp. the pension prospect large group 2 bi review 123/2006 population consist solely state retirement pension atp (labour market supplementary pension), plus private savings, e.g. home equity. why change today? why pension long government responsibility? back 1960s 1970s, predominant (but universal) view pension time take current output. the great share allocate pensioners, small share leave labour force years, make sense society save pensions. the spend power labour force senior citizen case adjust current consumption potential via fiscal policy. naturally, nation's economic strength, thus ability provide decent pensions, depend wealth: apparent wealth depend save private rather public sector. against background widespread belief pension preferably base "pay go" principle, i.e. generation finance pension previous generation via taxation. this also allow certain degree wealth redistribution affluent le affluent member society. this approach pension finance also confirm experience social pension fund. the latter conceive 1970 counter-cyclical instrument. for long fund receive contribution major policy issues, concrete proposal supplementary pension finance social pension fund ever tabled. instead, fund's revenue use finance e.g. house allowances. in term communication, impossible task balance overall economic interest design supplementary pension senior citizens' expectation disbursement fund. after year decide discontinue payment fund. and balance payments. the deficit constant barrier activities, bad year even send 4 per cent annual output abroad interest external debt. on hand, mean external asset rather debt, would able spend produced. this explain politician begin view pension save mean increase total save society, without consider would happen pension matured. it indeed balance-of-payments concern lead government 1987 enter "joint declaration" two side industry concern introduction labour-market pension via collective agreements. four year later, declaration implement actual collective agreement danish federation trade union danish employers' confederation introduce compulsory pension contributions. there several reason pension privately based. in opinion, decisive factor tax burden denmark, mid-1980s reach level around 50 per cent. there broad political consensus increase taxation would lead unsustainable imbalance society. it could also claim pension system base individual contribution robust development eu increasingly mobile workforce, although i aware argument put forward. so, almost universally acknowledge need increase save economy wage earners' wish pension line income grow accustom to, arise mixture become danish pension system. in many way serve u well, certainly help solve problem insufficient save economy. in fact, multi-pillar pension system danish system often single international context good benchmark counter demographic challenge face come decade population ages. our pension system base three pillars: firstly, state retirement pension atp; secondly, compulsory labour-market pensions; finally, private pensions, include capital pensions. to add equity home summer cottages, well savings. the system also base three finance pillars: finance via taxes, compulsory save voluntary savings. consequently, individual citizen's risk relation size future pension disbursement diversified, make system robust. bi review 123/2006 3 pension save boom throughout 1990s new millennium. it start collective bargain 1991, two side industry agree 0.9 per cent wage pay pension scheme. wage earner pay one third, employer pay two thirds. since see continuous increase pension contribution connection subsequent collective bargaining. today, pension contribution many wage earner constitute 10 per cent basic wages, labour-market pension fund – i.e. exclude atp, ld pension special pension fund – manage asset approximately kr. 1,300 billion, equivalent almost 85 per cent gdp. a chart 1 shows, figure almost quadruple 15 years. for comparison, deposit danish bank double period. the prevalence build labour-market pension scheme also mean people pension save besides state retirement pension atp. in 2002, 85 per cent wage earner work full time contribute labour-market pension scheme. for entire labour force, figure approximately 75 per cent. 4 bi review 123/2006 the percentage wage pay pension scheme vary considerably, however, chart shows, increasing. this good news individual citizen, look forward money spend retirement, also danish society. in long term, demographic trends, i.e. rise number retire people proportion labour force, mean disbursement pension fund gradually catch probably exceed payment pension funds. view isolation, strengthen government finance since pension contribution tax-deductible pension disbursement taxed. we thus see swell balance sheet, asset manage pension company merely defer tax, trend towards positive net disbursement entail gradual realisation government's tax asset. on hand, trend increase spend power ratio production output today's level. whether lead actual balance-of-payments problem remain seen. but imagine situation succeed increase pension savings, pension mainly base current tax revenue! 3. a safe secure currency system section 1 danmark nationalbank act 1936 state that: low inflation precondition safe secure currency system. since 1982, denmark pursue target low stable inflation via fixed-exchange-rate policy. consequently, maintain stable exchange rate one danmark nationalbank's principal responsibilities. the fixed-exchange-rate policy cornerstone denmark's economic policy. danmark nationalbank declare objective keep krone stable vis-à-vis euro. danmark nationalbank two exchange-rate instrument disposal. these intervention use foreign-exchange reserve, short-term interest rate. the foreign-exchange reserve use manage small fluctuation supply demand danish kroner, interest rate use connection imbalance sustain nature. a player international capital markets, pension company may influence exchange rate purchase sell securities. it therefore important danmark nationalbank keep abreast development within sector. in connection major portfolio restructure sometimes see large inflow outflow currency. if danmark nationalbank act situation, result could inappropriate exchange-rate fluctuations. on average, capital import kr. 10 billion strengthen danish currency kr. 0.12 per 100 euro. our analysis show pension sector's trade foreign security contribute explain change exchange rate krone. it interest note significance sector exchange rate appear increase recent years. bi review 123/2006 5 our analysis also show portfolio investment euro area great impact exchange rate krone equivalent portfolio investment rest world. this indicate market participant le incline hedge exchange rate investment euro area due denmark's fixed-exchange-rate policy vis-à-vis euro. portfolio restructure pension company problematic. it natural element free movement capital, precondition well-functioning capital market. fortunately, danmark nationalbank competent employee monitor day-to-day fluctuation foreign-exchange market therefore ready act krone strengthen weaken much. we also appreciate credibility enjoy denmark's fixed-exchange-rate policy – nationally internationally. let take opportunity explode myth. the fact danish economy fundamentally sound, decline government debt save surplus, problematic relation maintain fixed-exchange-rate policy. any exchange-rate fluctuation arise portfolio restructure short-term nature. the opposite situation – i.e. weak economy – might constitute problem, however. 4. macroeconomic development – debtor creditor nation danmark nationalbank cannot take full credit faith denmark's fixed-exchange-rate policy. part explanation 1980s denmark manage get fiscal policy control, slowly, obstacle path, structural current-account deficit turn surplus. sustainable fiscal policy clear distribution responsibility relation economic policy make easy central bank meet objectives. in denmark, distribution responsibility explicitly formulated: monetary policy aim ensure stable exchange rate vis-à-vis euro, specifically danish need stabilise cyclical fluctuation handle via fiscal policy. a regard favourable development balance payments, obvious pension sector also play role, primarily increase savings. a i already mentioned, increase pension save via e.g. labour-market pension scheme influence economic development denmark recent years. while economic debate previously focus lack savings, current-account deficit government deficits, save surplus. one driver development increase pension savings. 6 bi review 123/2006 however, forget net save would hardly positive real interest rate tax also – case – positive, thus create incentive save. the fixed-exchange-rate policy play vital role since help keep inflation bay. whether overall save real term increase compulsory pension contribution introduce naturally depend whether contribution replace savings. calculation ministry economic business affair indicate increase pension contribution full impact total savings. this mean save supplant high pension savings. the trend towards increase save mean end 2005 denmark become net creditor vis-à-vis country first time since world war ii. 5. pension company financial stability at danmark nationalbank define financial stability state exists: in words, focus function financial system – smooth provision money society. the pension sector part financial system influence financial stability denmark. bi review 123/2006 7 unlike banks, pension company indirect impact financial stability, however. pension company characterise long-term obligation cannot terminate overnight. this mean risk "run" – i.e. situation policyholder simultaneously seek redeem save short notice – virtually non-existent. let emphasise financial stability cannot merely define lack "runs". this essential precondition, sufficient itself. a i already said, focus function financial system, respect confidence paramount importance. it essential pension saver trust pension companies, i.e. feel confident money pay-out time. the best way ensure asset pension company fluctuate step liability economic assumption change. "traffic lights" today, pension company focus risk management risk hedge 5-10 year ago. the danish financial supervisory authority prepare risk scenario – know traffic light – "snapshots" use test robustness pension company negative market development. the principle behind traffic light visualise pension companies' investment insurance risk pension company time react change risk scenario late. this undoubtedly help make danish pension sector robust financial insurance risks. this also necessary increasingly globalise world external shock also reflect danish economy. the introduction new, complex financial product make great demand pension sector, also authorities. it important board management pension company understand underlie risk relation give investment liability. otherwise may nasty shock one day. a case point failure ltcm 1998. long-term capital management large u hedge fund specialise build large gear position across several markets, finance via loan numerous u european financial institutions. ltcm seek exploit imperfection market. the success strategy depend number assumption concern underlie market correlation volatilities. however, nobel prize winner myron scholes robert merton board thing could go wrong! nevertheless, did. the underlie assumption prove valid face turbulent market conditions, 1998 ltcm fold lose 4.6 billion dollar le four months. danish pension company scarcely likely make equally risky investments, case illustrate seem risky beforehand may subsequently prove so. however, stress test traffic light downside. under turbulent market condition see autumn 2001, pension company compel undertake major portfolio restructure time order observe danish financial supervisory authority's traffic lights. this entail risk exacerbate negative spiral. and player fall market never obtain best price assets. the solution naturally abolish traffic lights, seek avoid situation may inappropriate. more specifically, mean company must adjust reserve match risks. the responsibility sector the growth danish pension asset make demand sector term accountability relation investment behaviour, well product range marketing. both commercial pension company labour-market pension fund increasingly encourage customer choose market-rate products, i.e. product return directly 8 bi review 123/2006 link development financial markets. in way large part investment risk transfer individual policyholder. an argument often use pension company sell "market products" return typically high traditional pension savings. that may well case, usually "free lunch". high expect return invariably involve great risk. if customer understand accept correlation, problem. the problem arise case advertise "clever" market make customer opt product understand relate risk! it therefore important pension company aware responsibility advisors. we cannot say sure interest rate share price develop future. the pension company may entertain certain expectations, no-one know actually happen. so seem like sound advice ex ante may prove ex post. the apply advice base taxation aspects. no-one know tax system look like 20-30 years' time relation structure individual incomes. the pension sector crisis wake plummet share price 2000-2002 obviously give many company rather shock. fall share price combine low interest rate rise life expectancy potent cocktail. one challenge sector therefore avoid similar situation future. many company opt solution base individual products, i.e. policyholder bear risks. this remarkable development. to put bluntly, insurance company seek avoid sell insurance – insurance relation market developments, relation life expectancy (i think great prevalence annuity pension policies). in area company surely ought comparative edge term pension save compare rest financial sector. 6. conclusion i speak pension sector unify sector, mean case. overall, divide two subsectors almost size: labour-market pension funds, own customers, commercial pension companies, typically part large financial group. the commercial pension company compete customer le way financial enterprises, i.e. basically seek convince customer offer best product relation price. the labour-market pension fund live quiet life. in many cases, member choice pension fund; lay collective agreement. when analyse market share life pension sector, make sense consider part sector policyholder enterprise real choice provider. base approach, five large pension company account approximately 90 per cent market end-2005, term gross premium total balance sheet. bi review 123/2006 9 competition good thing! turn cost pension companies, danish financial supervisory authority state 2005 report market development life-insurance company professional pension fund average cost pension scheme base collective agreement low market-oriented companies. this interest observation since competition increase efficiency thus drive cost down. i sure market-based company list number good reason explain case, i go detail. i merely point that, unlike returns, cost often predict relatively great certainty basis historical observations. empirical study thus show cost characterise considerable degree persistence. in plain language, mean company high cost today also likely high cost tomorrow. the apply company low costs. over work life, even small difference cost ratio amount several hundred thousand krone save individual policyholder time retirement. this emphasis importance focus costs, also need transparency customer see pay pay for. * * * today pension sector important part danish economy, indication change future. a large wartime generation retires, life expectancy population increases, denmark see number structural changes, need well-functioning pension sector obvious. it therefore positive pension sector increase focus risk management risk hedging, grow number dane save retirement. nil bernstein: recent economic financial development denmark speech mr nil bernstein, chairman board governor national bank denmark, annual meet danish banker association, copenhagen, 6 december 2006. * * * thank invite speak annual meet danish banker association. the danish economy still booming, sign slowdown near future. the upswing start mid-2003 gain momentum since then. originally underpin income-tax cuts, upswing gradually reinforce remarkable growth international economy. in picture, europe generally lag behind rest world, economic growth seem recede usa, activity increase among important trade partner europe. the danish upswing bring unemployment low level since oil crisis 1970s. in contrast previous upswings, balance payment still strong government surplus rest sound structural foundation. however, complete picture danish economy also include risks. the global imbalance still significant, enormous u current-account deficit dominant feature. overall, imbalance still generally expect redress time. the u economy slow due recede house market. the risk abrupt adjustment cannot rule out, though. however, danger signal regard danish economy come within. the future course depend denmark's ability tackle situation. for long time low inflation moderate wage increase order day denmark, like many countries. this phenomenon among thing result grow recognition favourable economic effect low inflation. low unemployment combine continue robust growth demand danish good entail risk pressure labour market lead high inflation. it well-known cause unemployment rise late stage. although consider likely course events, risk detrimental overheat economy growing. against background danmark nationalbank recommend – continue recommend – measure dampen overall increase demand order ensure sustain favourable economic development denmark. danmark nationalbank note government adopt wait-and-see approach. a stated, labour market pivotal issue year come. the number people group high participation rate declining, set limit labour-force growth. all indicator point large unchanged employment, contrast precede years’ increase 70,000 since 2003 upswing began. the labour shortage dampen continue upswing. in 2006, wage increase gain momentum, domestic price pressure build gradually. it uncertain much adjustment process ultimately impact inflation. the house market attract high attention, rightly so. we witness strong increase real property prices, especially great copenhagen area. the recent indicator point continued, moderate, price increases. some expensive area show sign slightly recede prices, case price property first put sale late reduced. the low interest rate principal driver growth house prices. in 1998 fixed-rate loan account 80 per cent households' total borrow bank mortgage-credit institutes. this share shrink 40 per cent. so half outstanding loan adjustable-rate outright variable-rate loans, expect expensive borrower service loan 2007 due increase short-term interest rate last year. bi review 122/2006 1 take account household also interest income, net interest expense tax increase kr. 2 billion, 0.3 per cent consumption. interest rate strong impact activity via effect time decision regard consumption investment. despite high interest rates, real interest rate tax still low – barely 1 per cent cases. the level interest rate therefore still expansionary effect danish economy. the economic upswing also reflect financial system. the banks' balance sheet grow strongly. at time, profit record-high, labour short supply, wage increase case large bonus payments. the banks’ lend grow 20 per cent year-on-year. the breakdown business lend lend household follow familiar pattern. lend household enter stage first consumption-driven upswing, show double-digit growth rate since 2004. the bank strongly penetrate market home finance mortgage loans. in addition, risk appetite many household increase – support market effort number banks. business lend gather steam late upswing business enterprise invest internal source finance support. business lend reach double-digit growth rate end 2004, growth reach 20 per cent year-on year. the high rate growth lend average banks. there considerable dispersion. for bank lend increase 50 per cent year-on-year. the strong growth lend clearly reflect composition banks' balance sheets. the difference banks’ lend deposit increase considerably recent years. total lend exceed total deposit three-digit billion krone amount. so bank become increasingly dependent financial market raise money-market loan bank issue security nationally internationally. the individual bank also find important maintain access source financing. these source sensitive traditional deposit change market condition assessment individual bank's financial performance. this could make bank vulnerable. the minster economic business affair finalise bill enable bank issue cover bond equal foot mortgage credit institutes. you may ask necessary change danish system finance real property via mortgage-credit institutes. the danish mortgage credit system well-functioning stable system, give owner real property access finance capital-market terms, transparent cost structure. let blunt. this change impose us, positive elements. it increase competition danish financial institutions, give access operate term condition foreign credit institutions. it also bear mind amendment entail radical change danish home finance overnight. many adjustment already take place last couple years. here, i mind "mortgage loans" launch bank great success. see perspective, cover bond issue bank promote financial stability stable source finance mortgage loans, thereby cover large deposit deficit satisfactory manner. when cover bond legislation amended, danmark nationalbank prefer simple, robust model. the bank call abolition current restriction redemption profile maturities. we support wish, propose threshold house loan reduce 70 per cent property value. this would also make easy institute comply requirement loan base cover bond must never exceed 80 per cent collateral value entire duration loan. if entail degree tightening, entirely unintentional. in connection work cover bonds, two committee set deal balance principle "joint funding", respectively. danmark nationalbank's position danish balance principle could adapt make flexible bring line modern risk-management principles. in connection important new balance principle provide degree security exist system. joint fund important issue many present here. market condition dictate issuance bond favourable price require large volumes. at time, wish danish banker association "that throughout customer relationship customer perceive 2 bi review 122/2006 bank creditor loan thereby customer's banker, even though bank fact administer loan behalf fund company". i understand important individual bank decision make locally counter. however, i quite sure extent would require change fundamental legal principles. bank already act intermediary behalf legal entity investment associations, insurance companies, etc. ultimately ministry justice ass whether request met. it danmark nationalbank's assessment danish bank system currently robust . profit extremely good, buff large, albeit declining. for bank overall, buff relation statutory minimum capital requirement last three year fall 7.5 4 per cent lend guarantees. the regulation danish bank sector undergo major change current years. the account rule change loan write basis objective value assessment. provision long make basis prudent account principle. in 2007, new capital-adequacy rule come force, solvency ratio credit institution calculate basis risk weight good match actual risk portfolio. the statutory capital requirement low actual terms, fluctuate more. i would like emphasise amendment account rule capital-adequacy rule mean legislation degree previously provide reserve credit institutions. this responsibility large extent transfer board managements, important establish adequate buff determine solvency ratio individual credit institution. finally, i would like say danmark nationalbank please note good performance financial sector, reflect sound danish economy. on behalf danmark nationalbank, i would like thank fine cooperation. bi review 122/2006 3 john hurley:

target2 securities. this aim provision eurosystem settlement facility central bank money euro-denominated security transactions. discussion bank security community initiative ongoing. oversight the oversight payment system core central bank function. in carry task, central bank seek minimize systemic risk, risk failure payment system participant could result participant unable meet obligations, lead potentially disastrous chain reaction failures. minimize systemic risk payment settlement system objective itself. it also precondition achieve financial stability efficient conduct monetary policy. these, turn, necessary integrity euro major global currency. our oversight role enshrine domestic european legislation. domestically legal basis central bank act 1997. in broad european context, one basic task european system central bank (of bank member) "to promote smooth operation payment systems". the eurosystem empower "to ensure efficient sound clear payment system within community countries". bi review 122/2006 1 back early 1990s, central bank focus large-value net system safety concern evident. gradually, however, focus oversight extended, vary degree different countries, to: • real-time gross settlement systems, • retail payment systems, • payment instrument payment cards, direct debit credit transfers, • third-party service providers, • central counterparties, • security clear settlement systems. the extensive range activity subject oversight reflect potential impact financial stability link smooth conduct monetary policy. central bank organise operational role payment system conflict oversight role. the bank currently directly oversee irish real-time gross settlement system, iris, two retail payment system concern paper electronic clearing. in so, apply provision central bank act, 1997 require payment system operate state approved, rule vetted, central bank. in approve payment system's rules, must regard "...proper orderly regulation payment system concern competition payment systems...". in assess soundness domestic payment systems, use reference internationally recognise principle develop committee payment settlement system central bank g10 countries. in addition direct arrangements, central bank involve number co-operative oversight roles. thus, relation target system, interlink eu euro-denominated real time gross settlement systems, participate eurosystem's oversight arrangements. the central bank continue oversight role relation target2, successor exist target system, due come stream november 2007. in addition oversight payment systems, 1997 act make bank responsible oversight security settlement systems. however, apart ntma's settlement system exchequer notes, ireland actually domestic security settlement infrastructure. trade irish government bond settle belgium-based euroclear bank, trade irish equity settle crest locate uk. because this, make arrangement whereby co-operate national bank belgium relation oversight euroclear bank, term memorandum understanding. discussion on-going uk's financial service authority relation similar memorandum understand oversight crest. these arrangement illustrate increasingly cross-border nature payment settlement activity require co-operation among central bank overseers. in view, central bank successfully meet challenges, see example i've mention show variety, flexibility co-operative nature arrangement central bank involved. a i've already mentioned, role payment system oversight expand recent years, eurosystem become increasingly involve oversight payment instrument debit cards, credit card cheque payment networks. a consequence, central bank also become active area. naturally, intensity oversight commensurate perceive potential systemic impact instruments. i hope summary central bank's payment system role go way towards explain field. in order reach wide audience intention publish, come year, detail report work area payment system oversight. our oversight role - covering, does, payment system payment instrument - lead naturally interest issue cover today, sepa national payment implementation programme. 2 bi review 122/2006 sepa move single euro payment area (or sepa) initiative, aim advance european integration put place competitive innovative euro-area retail payment market bring high service levels, efficient product cheap alternative make payments. the origin sepa lie introduction euro 1999. although wholesale - interbank - payment cater target, citizen participate country comparable facility make cross-border, non-cash, low cost, retail payment euro, even though share common banknote coin euro cash changeover take place 2002. even now, national retail payment market remain essentially isolate euro-area member states, level efficiency service vary one euro-area member state another. a result, cross-border retail payment euro slow le efficient comparable payment make within one country. this payment system rules, procedures, standard technical system vary country country. therefore, good service trade freely across euro area, underlie payment still hamper national border arrangements, completion 'internal market' degree frustrated. the sepa project aim ensure consumer throughout euro area, whether individual citizen corporate entities, available common retail payment instruments. in principle, end process 2010, euro-area bank customer able use one payment account one set standardize instruments. this simplify payment world result sepa major benefit make cross-border payments. when sepa project completed, euro area payment will, effect, become domestic current differentiation national cross-border payment disappear. competition enhanced, since consumer use payment services, make cross-border payments, able choose payment service provider throughout euro area, regardless might located. this foster innovation provision payment services. it also forget sepa bring benefit associate real modernisation payment functionality throughout euro area. thus, acknowledge sepa undoubtedly involve large-scale investment bank industry, longer-run, open euro area payment market competition mean industry share benefit project. one topical debate sepa arena relate payment card - particular debit card - become sepa-compliant. in regard, eurosystem recently issue progress report view development "sepa cards". the challenge area ensure successful transition integrate market time preserve efficiency low cost level characterise exist national payment card schemes. sepa migration lead deterioration condition cardholder merchants. this area closely monitor eurosystem subject discussion involved. while strong support eurosystem eu commission sepa, remain primarily market-driven project. the role eurosystem (of bank part) relation sepa catalyst, facilitator, leave implementation private sector. however, eurosystem work actively epc - european payment council - market participant ensure necessary plan preparatory work carry coordinate way. since formation 2002, epc act european bank industry's decision-making co-ordination body sepa, make significant progress towards make project reality, create solid foundation upon built. in practical terms, epc body responsible define rules, procedure standard apply new sepa-compliant payment instrument bank use develop competitive product offer customers. a body primary responsibility implementation sepa ireland, i'd like take opportunity commend ipso speedy preparation irish national sepa migration plan, agree sign chief executive ipso member bank december last year; ireland fact one first country complete national sepa migration plan. bi review 122/2006 3 it essential sepa implementation migration process include necessary degree engagement interest parties. in regard, i please see sepa stakeholder forum establish ipso already hold two meetings, government departments, public utilities, direct debit originator business organisation represented. this development central bank much encourages, i hope forum, conference like one, play significant role increase public awareness sepa next couple years. i also strongly support focus communication that, i understand, plan 2007. the european bank industry cannot, however, operate vacuum. sepa major european objective every sense, public authority support sepa therefore vital. a eurosystem, sepa firmly root eu commission policy, strongly support promote institutions. the eu commission see sepa part european integration process, facilitate initiative provide common eu legal environment via propose payment service directive. strong support sepa project also express recently eu council minister economic affair finance, ecofin council. national payment implementation programme finally i'd like turn national payment implementation programme. in undertake programme work, ipso state intention develop future payment infrastructure ireland would see world class payment environment 'which deliver efficiency sector economy, inclusive sector society, share benefit universally". the central bank fully share objective stand ready assist, way can, effort involve deliver goal strategy. rapid progress implement programme would much enhance efficiency whole payment area impact positively competitiveness entire irish economy. the importance develop ireland's payment system infrastructure recognise high level; well ipso member banks, various government departments, central bank financial regulator involve early stage. it encourage note extensive consultation many groups. the involvement broad constituency possible undoubtedly best way achieve successful outcome. the development ireland's payment system infrastructure - particularly area retail payment much influence external factors, principally drive sepa project. there significant common grind sepa national payment implementation programme, focus much electronic payments. both initiative suggest little future cheque payment instrument, certainly context make cross-border payments. cheque characterise expensive relatively inefficient, central bank eurosystem concur view. indeed, sepa 4th progress report, eurosystem go far state "cheques...will...ultimately disappear become clear user mean payment provide good service. by 1 january 2008, expect national bank community euro area put place strategy promote use alternative electronic mean payment..." "by end 2010...the use cheques...is expect follow clear downward trend...". to ensure national payment initiative achieve full potential, irish bank must offer electronic payment method are: • safe efficient; • easy use; • accessible all, • expensive exist national instruments. the public authority also important role play ensure success programme promoting, respect payment business, use electronic mean payments. 4 bi review 122/2006 conclusion to conclude, i hope i able clarify role central bank payment area. i reiterate stand ready assist ipso, irish bank community others involve way possible deliver sepa national payment implementation programme. i would like thank attention, also would like extend participant afternoon's 'breakout sessions' best wish successful outcome deliberations. bi review 122/2006 5 jens thomsen: brief overview danish economy statement mr jens thomsen, member board governor national bank denmark, meet danish economic council, copenhagen, 5 december 2006. * * * development 2006 reflect extraordinarily high demand danish economy. the growth demand continue 2007, forecast gdp growth fall approximately 2 per cent, leave rest demand cover net imports. this indicate danish economy close capacity limit. high wage increase also expected. if growth demand danish good exceed productivity growth, pressure labour market increase, unless supply labour expanded. this labour requirement hardly meet domestically, difficult judge far sufficient resource provide abroad. it state line danmark nationalbank even economy become flexible still considerable risk overheating. such overheat will, stated, lead significantly high wage increases, thereby extend period low growth. on basis danmark nationalbank recommend demand curtailed. the economic council also recommend tighten fiscal policy. bi review 122/2006 1 nout wellink: goal strategy basel committee remark dr nout wellink, president netherlands bank chairman basel committee bank supervision, high level meet implementation basel ii asia other regional supervisory priorities, hong kong, 11 december 2006. * * * i. introduction thank much opportunity address important meet implementation basel ii asia regional supervisory priorities. i would like thank hong kong monetary authority host event, congratulate fsi emeap put together impressive conference program. hong kong dynamic city rapidly grow region, i think good place discus change take place bank supervision. what i would like morning talk briefly goal basel committee, outline strategy work program committee place achieve goals, provide conclude thoughts. ii. goal committee a new chairman basel committee, i think appropriate time step back consider broad goal strategy committee. i would like start share today committee’s objective i see them. in view, committee three broad objectives. one, provide forum dialogue information exchange among supervisors. two, promote improvement bank risk management practice framework bank supervision. and three, promote mechanism pragmatic implementation principle develop committee. turn first objective, core goal committee always provide forum dialogue information exchange. this help promote supervisory co-operation, great consistency, level play field increasingly global bank industry. information share dialogue also much broad aim, however. that provide committee context perspective need develop policy practice effectively promote robust bank financial system. the second objective committee perhaps visible broad community. with insight gain information share development risk management, supervision financial markets, committee promote improvement areas. in regard, committee seek develop promote proportionate response issue identify use range tools. this may include undertake fundamental research, prepare range-of-practice papers, necessary develop new policy guidance. third, know, policy guidance develop promote basel committee base consensus rather formal international legal agreements. an important objective committee therefore promote credible, practical flexible mechanism achieve effective policy implementation wide range countries. the successful implementation international policy require process mechanism engage non-committee supervisors, sector industry throughout lifecycle initiative. with objective mind, i would like discus committee’s strategy work towards achieve goals. iii. the committee’s strategy work program the committee’s strategy four interrelate reinforce elements. the first element strategy maintain strong capital foundation. that strong foundation enhance basel ii framework, many country process implementing. secondly, committee reinforce strong capital foundation promote infrastructure need sound supervision. thirdly, committee develop policy response proportionate flexible. bi review 122/2006 1 fourthly, committee deepen expand outreach non-committee supervisors, sectors, industry. strong capital foundation it come big surprise implementation basel ii framework one high priority current work program. integrate effective approach supervision, incentive bank improve risk management measurement, risk-based capital requirement fundamental objective basel ii. by definition, don’t know next economic financial shock come from. our focus, therefore, important role capital key shock-absorber individual banks, bank system generally, matter next shock entails. the implementation basel ii reflect reality simple risk measures, embody basel i are, large complex bank organisations, long meaningful. a strong capital foundation require risk-sensitive capital framework flexible adapt innovation. moreover, promote improvement bank risk management supervisory practices, enhance transparency market discipline. the three pillar basel ii develop goal mind. i would also like emphasise choice individual country make respect time implementation basel ii, menu option available basel ii, consider development bank supervisory systems, financial markets. this lead next point – importance support infrastructure. other support infrastructure for risk management supervision effective efficient, sufficient sound capital framework. the second element committee’s strategy get basic support infrastructure place. the development core principle effective bank supervision, committee’s liaison international account bodies, committee’s work cross-sectoral body joint forum example effort promote fundamental infrastructure need sound bank system effective supervision. build foundation effective supervision promote prudence integrity financial account integral part committee’s current work. a sound system account provision underpin integrity risk measures, capital adequacy meaningful market discipline. moreover, many would know well, enough focus attention implication policy bank traditional line various financial sector become le clear. it therefore important understand implication market development supervisory change non-bank financial institution financial market generally. supervision sophisticate model approaches. rather understand risk bank face promote good management risks. use appropriately, advance model approach help bank refine sharpen ability measure, monitor control risk. use inappropriately however, without understand limitation assumption build models, cost may great benefits. in respect, i view infrastructure support capital foundation vitally important. an initiative committee begin work so-called “definition capital”. over past decade witness significant advance way bank manage economic capital, well development new innovative capital instruments. the definition capital topic highlight importance support legal account infrastructure, need understand market dynamic within across jurisdictions. at stage, committee’s work area focus stocktaking issues. proportionate policy flexible framework the third element committee’s strategy promote proportionate policy responses, develop flexible policy frameworks. the committee promote range supervisory method advocate proportionality supervisory approaches. the supervisory tool may include good 2 bi review 122/2006 regulation, supervisory guidance, range-of-practice papers. in addition, cases, industry-led solution may best approach. to respond accelerate pace financial innovation globalisation need flexible frameworks. both core principle basel ii example global standard develop local application. both initiative flexible responsive innovation. for example, basel ii provide menu option suit institution range complexity. moreover, advance approach base model approach develop advance bank – allow regulatory bank model develop together. over past ten years, observe significant change international capital flows, great reliance market fund many jurisdictions, bank become active buyer seller complex financial instruments. in light central role bank play provide liquidity, i believe liquidity risk management area would appropriate committee exploratory work. i believe much gain share information supervisory approach assess liquidity, bank tool manage liquidity, particularly stress scenarios. in cases, i expect committee’s response proportionate risk identified, policy tool committee employ design achieve maximum benefit least cost. i also expect committee consult widely process develop view issue deliberate possible responses. proactive outreach this bring fourth element committee’s strategy, engage proactive outreach. this encompass outreach non-committee countries, industry sectors. the committee’s dialogue non-committee member country extremely important element strategy. this stem need promote development sound supervisory practice develop market accommodate grow importance sophistication non-committee member banks, supervisor markets. in addition, critical address home-host coordination issue arise growth cross-border banking. these trends, result need dialogue, quite clear look grow change financial landscape increase trend towards market liberalisation asian region. a indication importance committee place outreach strategy, october meet merida committee agree establishment international liaison group (ilg). this group replace core principle liaison group, completion revise core principle complete mandate. the new ilg report directly committee, allow broad supervisory dialogue range issues. the ilg provide platform non-member country contribute new committee initiative early process, develop new proposals. the ilg also initiate work stream issue interest broad supervisory community. i also highlight important relationship committee fsi, provide outstanding program train event tool supervisor around globe. member committee secretariat actively involve fsi event since founding, see key element outreach dialogue wide supervisory community. by engage dialogue range level - within supervisory community, industry, representative sectors, also interest party - committee aim identify address important risk issues. this process filter issue may lead committee consider new initiative time time. however, case exchange information idea give topic, make transparent industry range practice see rapidly develop area, may important outcomes. iv. conclude think i would like conclude summarise main theme talk. the committee’s goal are, view, provide forum information sharing, promote improvement risk management bi review 122/2006 3 bank supervision, promote mechanism facilitate consistent local implementation global policy principles. the committee multi-faceted strategy achieve goals, develop within context development international bank financial markets. the strategy work program committee place build around cornerstone strong capital framework. this support fundamental infrastructure, include strong accounting; core principle effective bank supervision cross sector collaboration. proportionality flexibility overarch theme permeate policy work. finally, committee’s strategy proactive outreach dialogue critical long-run success work undertake today. thank you. 4 bi review 122/2006 stanley fischer: the openness israel’s economy global economy importance israel’s join oecd address professor stanley fischer, governor bank israel, globe business conference 2006, tel-aviv, 11 december 2006. * * * the subject address today openness israel’s economy global economy, i focus importance israel’s join oecd. a. the state economy first, i would like briefly review state economy, picture quite rosy one. the economy recover rapidly war north, even fast think first. national account data indicate 1.4 percent decline (in annual terms) gdp third quarter. the impact hostility gdp weak assess previously, appear rate growth 2006 4.8 percent, slightly high initial post-war forecast. our forecast 2007 still indicate healthy growth 4 percent. this assessment immediately hostilities, i surprise revise upwards future. furthermore, recent unemployment data point reduction rate unemployment third quarter 8.3 percent, compare 8.9 percent third quarter 2005, alongside rise rate participation labor force 2006. the nominal-financial side complete picture strong economy. inflation low, financial market function well, include foreign currency market, reflect global development also large inflow foreign investment israel impressive surplus balance payment current account (expected reach 4.7 percent gdp 2007). at point i would like refer fact currently inflation low limit target range. at outset i must state obvious: external shock significant impact inflation, effect strong immediate. why i say this? you remember first half year rate inflation previous twelve month upper limit range, 3.5 percent. now, cumulative drop 1.5 percent september october, rate fall low limit. the bank israel’s approach try bring rate back gradually within range, possible midpoint range, one year forward horizon. the underlie reason approach avoid cause inflation volatility sharp change interest rate. take follow situation hypothetical example: bank israel act keep inflation next twelve month close midpoint target, i.e., 2 percent year. but let u say next ten month roll twelve-month inflation rate low limit range drop index 1.5 percent september october mention above. we may see twelve-month retrospective inflation rate within target two month drop calculation. we could act differently reduce interest rate drastically bring inflation back within target much quickly, could create unstable process overshoot opposite direction, inflation exceed target. it therefore worthwhile react every shock occurs, preferable persist policy gradually revert inflation target within year. b. the openness economy now main topic today, openness israel’s economy global economy. this important issue economic openness new reality affect us, may internalize areas. this conference, others like it, take pride many important participant abroad, provide one indication new reality live. israel one first country realize small economy cannot grow without open participate global economy. a early 1960s set path liberalization international trade. but program expose economy abroad mid-1980s bi review 121/2006 1 liberalization foreign currency market capital flow initiate bank israel 1990s significant aspect process. it open economy global economy, create framework macroeconomic policy operate accord norm accept advance economies, base budget inflation targeting. this provide infrastructure enable economy achieve sustain growth, provide policymakers know face challenge place them. this even case general consensus matter fiscal discipline. we sometimes speak change economic policy, change essential development last fifteen years. we must however recognize one important fact: growth derive increase private sector, israel private sector main successful, innovative creative. it private sector day day prof ability compete world. israel’s economy open world, reflect various ways: 1. in current decade (2000–06) share export gdp reach average 40 percent. 2. in period share import gdp reach average 41 percent. 3. foreign investment israel reach $ 17 billion january–october 2006, all-time peak. 4. israelis’ investment abroad january–november 2006 reach $ 21 billion, $ 12 billion direct investments. 5. israel second place (after us) term number company list trade nasdaq. what require economy open competition around world? there still area ought improve, i refer aspect microeconomic sphere. in context i would like mention do business report world bank, grade country accord ease business them. israel list 26 175, bad all. but look different component go grading, see good certain aspect (investor protection, obtain credit, international trade, open close business), score badly others (obtaining licenses, enforce contract register assets). it important take step improve area order contribute good business environment. we generally relate area important foreign investors. but important investor israel’s economy, domestic foreign. every israeli investor choice invest abroad. if improve atmosphere surround investment israel, likely lose domestic investment israeli investors’. c. the oecd the subject openness israel’s economy bring question israel’s join oecd. what oecd? it organization 30 country commit democracy market economy, among advance economies. among member us, japan, canada, australia, european countries. the oecd cooperate 70 countries, activity encompass wide range fields, macroeconomics, finance, foreign trade, investment capital flows, taxation, education, quality environment, science innovation, energy market, social policy, market structure (with emphasis competition), companies’ organizational structure, transparency. the oecd deal creation rule conduct sphere objective promote international agreement necessary global economy. most work oecd perform intergovernmental teams, thus report base information provide member governments. in oecd forum country exchange information knowledge, devise method confront economic problems, identify formulate standard appropriate conduct relevant economic areas, develop way improve coordination cooperation 2 bi review 121/2006 them. representative member country operate within framework 200 specialist committee various policy areas. why important israel join oecd? membership would offer follow advantages: 1. it would promote israel’s position important world economic forums, would strengthen economic ties. 2. it would enable u “in know” relatively early stage formulation standard sphere economic policy, adapt policy standards, even contribute experience. 3. it would help u promote economic reforms. 4. it would also help improve israel’s rat international financial markets. what israel’s current position vis-à-vis oecd? israel’s economy open, per caput gdp high, degree economic openness good, even excellent certain fields, r&d. all give israel stand potential member oecd. moreover, since 1996 israel participate various format committee oecd, mainly role observer. the oecd currently process make decision number new member accept organization, expansion implemented, standard require new members. these decision expect take shortly conference minister may 2007. acceptance new member country require consensus among member countries. professional specialist government, bank israel relevant body contact oecd regard israel’s acceptance full member, hope consensus among exist member question membership. it important israel’s membership oecd remain high agenda various entity involve matter, progress make area need special attention. this significant stage integration israel open, modern economy global economy. i hope make it. thank you. bi review 121/2006 3 ardian fullani: bank albania – progress 2006 speech mr ardian fullani, governor bank albania, “round table target inflation 2”, tirana, 8 december 2006. * * * lady gentlemen, i want conclude round table thank contributions. we really happy come tirana discuss monetary policy strategy bank albania. this round table inflation target excellent follow-up open forum. at open forum last year december globally discuss many precondition inflation targeting. during two day round table, yesterday today, go far deep complex issues. these issue need solve bank albania put fully fletched inflation target regime place. at round table discuss progress bank albania make 2006. one discuss topic econometric model forecasting. the bank albania us reliable analytical framework provide information useful monetary policy decision making. under inflation target information would need expect inflation development future. a lay central bank law, primary objective bank albania achieve maintain price stability albania. for keep price stable need able forecast development price future. our current econometric model provide u information future developments. our internal study show bank albania able make reliable forecasts. we also discuss consequence situation consumer price index increases, let u say, 3% annual basis. this may instance happen due high electricity prices, high oil prices. these energy price main share daily expenditures. therefore, main share total basket consumer price “average” albanian household. however, focus discussion analysis impact albanian macro-economy. high price lead low purchase power. household buy le case price increase, condition unchanged household income. then, many household albania start consume less, albanian economic growth suffer. the albanian production slow due overall low demand good services. this process take time. but, anyhow, economist agree strong increase price bad economy. a high inflation, another way say strong increase prices, harm economic growth. the bank albania aim average increase consumer price index 3%. the bank albania set interest rate keep expect price increase 3% plus minus 1 percentage point. it build macro-econometric model channel transmit monetary policy albanian economy. the main purpose model analyze reaction prices, private consumption business investment on, reaction change may take place. we call change analytical term “shocks” economy. our macro-econometric model promising. very promising. but build econometric model need statistics. albania statistics, need good statistics. for year come, bank albania want improve statistical framework. the bank albania need good statistics, i said. with “better” statistic i mean “more” statistics, “reliable” statistic “user-friendly” statistics. we need measure macro-economic development economy better. and need keep track developments. our albanian history still short. we time series 15 years. in time logically long time series. our time series need become timely available fully understandable. inside bank albania work statistics. in year 2007 bank albania improve database monetary financial statistics, balance payment bi review 121/2006 1 statistics. but, statistic depend upon national statistical office, instat. we also depend institution provide u relevant information. next broaden deepen statistical framework bank albania improve upon communication public. we discuss round table transparency bank albania. we conclude significant progress achieved. but next transparency, bank albania want improve upon information provide public. the bank albania aim make monetary policy understandable everybody. we know already money matters. the money possess, buy, economy grow. the economy grows, people share. poverty reduced. but monetary policy? we know high wage low price beneficial personal pockets. the high wages, low prices, buy. but albanian economy whole, flipside. this flipside inflation. more spend lead high price medium long term. and high prices, i also say “higher inflation”, damage albanian economic growth. for reason bank albania safeguard price stability. our main task keep price stable. in order so, set main interest rate. the bank albania want communicate good monetary policy issues. it want explain monetary financial benefit micro macro level. it want explain good aim inflation rate 3%. the communication strategy bank albania explain work monetary policy issue tasks, all. the understand public need good conduct inflation targeting. credibility gained. a say before, solid statistical framework also indispensable. reliable statistic tell u past present. on basis this, bank albania use econometric model forecast future. the bank albania conduct monetary policy, target inflation better, case good forecasts. we stress preconditions. but fulfillment precondition inflation target depend also others albanian economy. under inflation targeting, monetary policy aim precise inflation target medium term. the bank albania reach target case interest rate set affect deposits, credits, private consumption business investment, gdp, like develop market economy. only case monetary policy effective. therefore, precondition put full fletched inflation target place meet only bank albania. they depend upon development albanian economy, depend upon provision statistic instat others, depend upon understand public. they also depend upon key player like ministry finance depend upon efficient work financial markets. other precondition inflation target partly meet bank albania. the full implementation inflation target therefore take place only conditionally. one compare situation tailor suit special occasion. let make comparison. one find good tailor ask make suit special occasion. all measure taken, length arm length legs. the suitable material found. one need appropriate fabric, appropriate color. upon precondition (1) good tailor (2) precise measure (3) suitable materials, tailor start tailor suit. but, still guarantee suit fit perfect. or, may happen look appeal tailor-shop, day special occasion. for instance, temperature may fall need additional coat, even different fabric. or, environment special occasion may make look overdressed. you try make perfect, environment lag behind. factor could influence make look different wish look new suit. conclusion: the suit suitable, better, suit (yet) suitable. for reason try tailor suit regularly. all precondition inflation target need check re-assessed regular basis. 2 bi review 121/2006 at round table discuss econometric modeling, statistic communication, also legal framework, internal governance bank albania arrange agreement ministry finance instat. during year draft new bank law. this law increase customer protection, set legal grind credit information registry, introduce new rule risk administration, bring confidence bank system well. with assistance imf legal department revise agreement ministry finance. these agreement standardize emphasize role bank albania fiscal agent. moreover agreement aim create cooperative partnership environment. we remain commit increase cooperation major governmental agency ease proper understand monetary policy process, implication need harmonize coordinate policies. conclude i would like underline carefully evaluate degree precondition meet shift fully fledge inflation target medium run. such strategy increase effectiveness monetary policy albania consolidate price stability contribute sustainable economic growth. we re-assess precondition regularly type meet foreign professionals. in meantime establish professional dialog among central bank, instat, ministry finance government institutions. once more, lady gentlemen, i thank much contributions. i wish safe return back home countries. bi review 121/2006 3 bi review 121/2006 1

[see slide 11] the broad-based strengthen profitability drive lend growth, compensate erosion lend margin result intense competition. non-interest source income also contribute bottom-line. at time, cost-containment continue loan impairment charge decline further. solvency ratio euro area lcbgs remain comfortable despite decline slightly first half 2006, due rise risk-weighted assets. from financial stability perspective, encourage institution low capital ratio past also improve first six month 2006. the assessment credit risk become complicate recourse crt markets. for instance, impact potential turn credit cycle bank might mute early downturns, albeit necessarily part financial system since risk disappear. other risk face bank sector mainly relate interest rate risks, flat yield curve environment limit bank return core business. there concern could encourage seek risky venture effort boost profits, result increase operational counterparty risk grow exposure unregulated financial institutions. notwithstanding risk identified, market analyst expect profitability euro area lcbgs likely strengthen short term, underpin favourable economic outlook benign credit conditions.

continue war cease hostilities. monnet london time, utmost encourage french government continue war. de gaulle already settle london. monnet propose british government something dramatic galvanize french government. the proposal create close union england france. the union would common currency, would form custom union national would common citizenship rights. winston churchill hesitated, nonetheless forward proposal government discuss. to surprise, government receive proposal enthusiastically approve 14 july 1940. charles de gaulle likewise become historic figure next day speech make bbc. de gaulle like federal tone monnet's text, pragmatist understand need must steer devil drives. the reaction france one astonishment. it quite simply possible put roof wall house built. it was, however, hop would give french prime minister extra time. but be. petain come power begin negotiate armistice germany. france lost. national sovereignty raison d'etat problem monnet discuss need european integration several occasion war. he idealistic federalist, practical man. at league nation monnet disappoint organization's failure act practice. he convince mutual dependence nation fact life rampant nationalism main cause war. monnet convince political stability economic prosperity europe call creation common free trade area. but enough away custom duties, since union necessary area too. his list include currency, prices, industrial agricultural production communications. monnet stress could peace europe, state continue structure around sort national sovereignty lead politics privilege economic protectionism. if state europe cut other, would necessary amass huge armies. and long would back war. bi review 120/2006 3 coincidentally, summer 1944 paasikivi discuss fate small countries. his read history make pessimist: "states act raison d'etat, i.e. interest state. it frightful, blood-red". he go on: "to date system devise would constrain raison d'etat protect country them." where monnet speak nationalism national sovereignty, paasikivi write raison d'etat. ultimately, talk thing. paasikivi saw key issue limit raison d'etat, whereas monnet saw basic problem limit national sovereignty. paasikivi's start point lot small country, think go this: "solving problem limit raison d'etat relationship morality issue that, although primarily affect future small countries, ultimately also determine future large country whole mankind." history make paasikivi pessimistic, also cautious. when monnet accuse over-optimistic connection numerous initiatives, always replied: "i optimist, i determined". for part, schuman summarize think unpublished memoirs: "the harsh lesson history teach me, man border area, i wary hasty improvisation over-ambitious projects, also teach objective judgment, found mature reflection base actual fact override interest mankind, lead u new even revolutionary endeavors, remain steadfast persevere them." the birth great idea the path cautious foreign minister alsace-lorraine, robert schuman, bold man action, jean monnet, cross post-war years. in february 1950 monnet go two-week cross-country ski trip alps. although guide mark ski route, monnet blaze conceptual trail lead pioneer think put paper evening. by time return proposal ready: france take initiative set coal steel union. this would resolve difficult dispute management coal steel normalize relation france germany. another statesman also best idea ski jogging, president paasikivi, namely urho kekkonen.1 in march 1950, monnet begin indirectly convey idea schuman eventually end april present complete plan. on may day schuman send message monnet: "i've read proposal. i'll make own". the core schuman's initiative member state would agree pool national sovereignty area coal steel umbrella community. the community run high authority (the forerunner european commission) would independent member countries' governments. the community would set basis treaty ratify parliament member countries. schuman think important make-up high authority ensure balance small large countries. schuman's initiative enthusiastically welcome public. the reaction political world mixed. it clear many issue germany adenauer. the christian democrat support plan unreservedly. the opposition social democrat party conference it. only one young little-known member parliament speak strongly support plan. his name willy brandt. it easy ride france. the centre, schuman represented, socialist support plan. the communist it, gaullists, since approve transfer

"an intelligent charm guest finland" several week late finnish foreign trade association try find speaker meeting. heikki brotherus, press counselor embassy paris, know schuman, since meet quaker functions. and schuman leave government, brotherus think would ideal candidate. the leadership foreign trade association delighted. but difficulty began. brotherus receive letter mr tarjanne, permanent secretary foreign ministry, accuse arbitrary conduct. brotherus respond charge writing. everyone know affair, except ambassador, johan helo. but many thing deal embassy paris time. helo appoint ambassador new wave war one so-called six.2 helo's relation foreign minister difficult, paasikivi protect helo right end period office. accord brotherus, foreign minister even go far ask french ambassador helsinki cancel schuman's plan visit finland. paasikivi state diary foreign minister, törngren, say 24 march, connection weekly visit, foreign trade association want make big event schuman's visit, government interest organize dinner reception devote particular attention schuman. despite awkwardness arrangements, schuman come finland visit april, three month leave government. schuman's visit give enormous coverage press. in presentation schuman stress war begin precisely six states. "by defuse hotbed war, do something really fundamental peace europe," stated. the government fact organize dinner devote particular attention schuman, unless one count supper invitation social affair minister, vaino leskinen, helsinki community hall, schuman meet trade union people. president paasikivi was, however, present schuman's presentation also audience him. paasikivi write diary pleasant impression schuman make him. schuman believe antagonism france germany would gradually remove coal steel community would step towards this. paasikivi go on: "i explain 2 the six name give opposition

visit week later. accord pravda, schuman's visit undeniably connect discussions, right-wing socialist launched, step trade finland soviet union. so leskinen escape criticism. the article put together stefan smirnov, great expert finland. jean monnet never meet paasikivi. however, october 1962 connection president kekkonen's visit france newspaper helsingin sanomat write one-column news-in-brief item kekkonen's meet "father europe". the item say president visit carré's house outside paris. louis carré distinguish parisian gallery-owner prominent admirer alvar aalto, finnish architect. aalto

talk english, although newspaper report content. president kekkonen visit france, time, upon invitation president charles de gaulle. this time de gaulle monnet deep disagreement european issues. president de gaulle consider national sovereignty untouchable monnet consider limitation key european integration. monnet believe independent european institution corner-stone europe, de gaulle was,

trichet, president european central bank, economic monetary affair committee european parliament, brussels, 20 december 2006. * * * madame la présidente, madame et monsieur le membres de la commission économique et monétaire, je réjouis de paraître devant votre commission aujourd’hui et de poursuivre ainsi notre dialogue régulier. je commencerai mon intervention par une évaluation de la situation économique et monétaire. anschließend möchte ich auf zwei themen näher eingehen: erstens, auf den zusammenhang zwischen produktivität, potentialwachstum geldpolitik. zweitens, auf da geldmengenwachstum verschiedenen abgrenzungen und dessen einfluss auf da preisgeschehen. economic monetary issue at time previous appearance european parliament october, i describe data available serve confirm assessment economic growth euro area become broadly base increasingly support domestic demand. in addition, cross-check economic monetary analysis underline existence upside risk price stability medium long term. in order contain upside risk price stability preserve firm anchor longer-term inflation expectations, 7 december govern council ecb decide increase key ecb interest rate 25 basis points. let explain assessment underlie decision outlook economy risk price stability. start economic analysis, main indicator economic activity become available past month confirm govern council’s assessment economic activity continue expand robustly, albeit moderate somewhat strong rate see first half year. accord eurostat’s first estimate, quarter-on-quarter growth rate real gdp euro area third quarter 2006 0.5%, drive mainly domestic demand. this confirm anticipate broaden recovery point increasingly self-sustaining nature economic expansion euro area. this assessment also line available information fourth quarter. look ahead next year, condition remain place euro area economy grow solidly rate around potential, volatility quarterly growth rate likely emerge around turn year account impact change indirect tax large euro area country. overall, global growth become geographically balance remain robust, provide support euro area exports. investment expect remain dynamic, benefit extend period favourable finance conditions, balance sheet restructuring, accumulate ongoing strong earnings, gain business efficiency. consumption also strengthen time employment condition continue improve. this outlook economic development reflect new eurosystem staff macroeconomic projection (2.5 % 2.9 % 2006, 1.7 % 2.7 % 2007, 1.8 % 2.8 % 2008) also line recent forecast make international organisations. the risk surround outlook sustain economic growth close potential lie downside relate mainly possibility renew increase oil prices, fear rise protectionist pressures, concern possible disorderly development owe global imbalances. turn price developments, annual hicp inflation rise 1.9% november 2006, 1.6% october. the low annual hicp inflation rate record previous month mainly reflect significant decline crude oil price august onwards, well base effects. while outlook energy price remain uncertain, overall inflation rate likely increase early 2007 hover around 2% course year 2008, also reflect impact high indirect taxes. the eurosystem staff projection point rate inflation 2.1 % 2.3 % 2006, 1.5 % 2.5 % 2007 1.3 % 2.5 % 2008. bi review 126/2006 1 this outlook price development remain subject upside risks, stem particular strong expect pass-through previous oil price increases, well possibility renew oil price increase additional increase administer price indirect tax beyond announce decide thus far. more fundamentally, give favourable momentum real gdp growth observe past quarter positive sign labour markets, wage development could strong currently expected. turn development monetary aggregate credit, annual m3 growth unchanged 8.5% october, remain close high rate observe since introduction euro. increase interest rate exert influence monetary development recent months, although yet mainly trigger shift among component m3 rather constrain expansion m3 itself. take appropriate medium longer-term perspective, late development consistent continuation persistent upward trend underlie rate monetary expansion, identify ecb’s monetary analysis since mid-2004. furthermore, follow several year robust monetary growth, liquidity situation euro area ample plausible measures. continue strong monetary credit growth environment ample liquidity point upside risk price stability medium long term. monetary development therefore continue require careful monitoring, particularly background improve economic condition continue strong property market development many part euro area. to sum up, annual inflation rate project hover around 2% come two years, risk outlook remain upside. in addition, give ongoing strength monetary credit growth environment ample liquidity, cross-check outcome economic analysis monetary analysis support assessment upside risk price stability prevail medium long term. a i say december 7, decision increase key ecb interest rate 25 basis point 7 december contribute ensure medium longer-term inflation expectation euro area remain solidly anchor level consistent price stability, prerequisite monetary policy make ongoing contribution towards support sustainable economic growth job creation euro area. indeed, act firm timely manner ensure price stability medium term warranted. the govern council therefore monitor closely development risk price stability medium term materialise. a regard fiscal policy, commission’s autumn forecast point improve fiscal balances, partly attribute progress structural consolidation, high economic growth revenue windfall play important role. moreover, number country fiscal imbalances, adjustment effort still fall short need meet respective medium-term objective timely manner. it therefore crucial forthcoming update stability programme make sufficient headway towards safe budgetary position country concerned. for country paramount pro-cyclical policy avoid current economic upswing. productivity, growth potential monetary policy over last fifteen year euro area witness almost steady deceleration growth rate labour productivity. this deceleration explain underlie developments, welcome, whereas others le favourable. first, effect welcome progress labour market reform wage moderation last decade. although seldom stress public discourses, measure contribute remarkable results. over last eight year (the period single monetary policy place), employment rise 9.2 percentage point unemployment rate decline 1.9 percentage points. let also stress i compare 8 year euro set 8 year euro, create 11.73 million job euro 2.65 million job euro. second, le welcome, decline productivity partly result capital investment keep pace job creation. the still exist rigidity product labour market impair effective competition flexibility, generally presence regulatory restraint business, prevent firm invest strongly adoption new information communication technologies, could effective tool reduce cost improve productivity. ultimately, growth rate actively work population pace technological progress implement production process critical determinant growth rate 2 bi review 126/2006 potential output. it extremely important, especially juncture, strengthen reform aim increase employment, foster competition product market create environment favourable development implementation new concept technologies. all individual need opportunity get appropriate training. in knowledge economy wealth prosperity european citizen depend education, train skill extent skill flourish flexible economy open innovation change. there sometimes call upon central bank expansionary monetary policy incentive increase productivity. i shall make two point this. first, monetary policy cannot enhance trend growth rate productivity potential output. a loose monetary policy would create high inflation inject volatility economy. on contrary, monetary policy gear deliver low stable inflation contribute create favourable macroeconomic environment employment creation investment decisions. price stability reduce interest rate premia, thus cost capital, allow wage price-setters focus productivity, cost competitive factors, rather waste resource protect uncertainty future inflation. second, negative productivity development i discuss drag economic activity, also put significant temporary upward pressure

development fifties, rapid industrialisation country development basic heavy industry guide industrial trade policy first (1951-56) second (1956-61) five-year plans. 'import substitution' recognise appropriate strategy rapid industrialisation. export pessimism permeate policy stance throughout early decade planning. this think base four premises, consider appropriate time. first, believe industrialisation proceed way increase production would bi review 126/2006 1 reflect large export earnings. secondly, argue give large domestic market, export need engine growth. thirdly, growth external demand india's product likely inelastic traditional nature exports. finally, know prebisch-singer argument primary commodity export face secular deterioration term trade. accordingly, export regard residual, vent-for-surplus occasion surplus available. the inward look industrialisation strategy first three plan result high rate industrial growth. however, sign strain balance payment clearly visible second plan (see table 1 attach trend india's current account). a import demand surge account development heavy industries, current account deficit (cad) second plan surge 2.3 per cent gdp. the difficulty finance fast grow import stagnant export put considerable strain reserve import cover reserve (or foreign currency assets) plunge barely two months’ terminal year second plan. in third plan, improve export performance slowdown import demand lead improvement cad time finance requirement meet step official assistance. the third plan reflect first sign rethink policy strategy dedicate ‘self sustain growth’, require ‘domestic save progressively meet demand investment balance payment gap bridge over’. while envisage normal capital flow continue, set early indication concept self reliance foresee steady reduction reliance special foreign aid programme dispense period time. a liberal view self reliance evolve third plan shift stress 'import substitution' policy emphasis 'efficient substitution imports'. however, reality, end 1970s, export primarily regard source foreign exchange rather efficient mean resource allocation. though devaluation 1966 bring fore problem associate overvalue exchange rate, bring immediate desire improvement balance payment position. in fact, cad-gdp ratio widen 2.0 per cent annual plan (1966-69). unlike export pessimism early plans, fourth plan (1969-74) visualise aggressive approach export growth achieve self reliance. a consequence, trade policy become primary instrument achieve dynamic concept self reliance prevalent early decades. however, fifth plan (1974-79) self reliance recognise explicit objective. in fifth plan, invisibles surface important element current account policy attention tourism shipping. discover remittance indian worker new source meet grow finance needs, period witness new confidence external sector prepare grind work take exchange rate regime base basket arrangement initiate since 1975. the fact remain phase till 1970s represent era dominance external assistance finance instrument balance payments.

review past recent efforts, current perception outcome noted. i mention national policy directions, follow by, i would call, new realities. i conclude lecture issue need address day ahead. review effort it useful recall rural bank traditionally monopoly money lenders, till colonial government enact co-operative society act 1904 view make co-operatives premier institution disbursement credit. the process three-tier structure bi review 126/2006 1 commence 1915. government also provide agricultural loan usually call takkavi loans, since discontinued. the rbi act vest unique responsibility rural credit central bank. all india rural credit survey (1951) rbi opine co-operatives "utter failure" provide rural credit, add vital role agriculture credit. the imperial bank nationalise sbi, visualise vehicle rural banking. a rural credit survey 1966 also conclude ineffectiveness co-operatives stress importance succeeding. many state government legislate registration regulation money lender little emphasis implementation. nationalisation bank 1969 give boost expansion bank bank rural areas. the reserve bank hive part role agricultural credit separate national level institution, viz, agriculture refinance development corporation (ardc) 1975. soon thereafter, legislation enact create regional rural banks, participation central state government nationalise banks, network spread

simultaneously, direct credit form priority sector lend continue administer interest rate regime lasted. during reform period, capital infuse rrbs nabard. while priority sector lend continued,

interest rate major segment farmers. in brief, vigorous determine effort towards expansion rural credit, especially rural banking. current perception outcome the litmus test effort outcome, perhaps even important, perception outcomes. these sum follows. first, non-institutional credit still continue far rural area agriculture sector concerned. second, credit-deposit ratio show despite intermediation banks, ratio continue low rural area. third, all-in cost credit banks, factor timeliness, transaction-costs, access, etc, appear high agriculture relative private corporate sector even

also appear high. seventh, co-operative credit system is, parts, dormant comment three-tier structure help finance bureaucracy rather benefit farmers. similarly, many part country, rrbs le active though others expanding. eighth, significant growth rural credit recent years, medium-term sustainability contingent upon growth agriculture improvement institutional settings. in brief, perception outcome vigorous vary effort expand reach rural banking, seem le expected. perhaps time ask questions. first strategies, term institution strategic directions, flaw along? have run idea regard? be think rural credit fall behind emerge reality economy? be need distinguish cause effect also symptom disease? be lack credit availability want commercial viability agriculture constrain credit-flow, complex combination both? while may able answer many question satisfactorily, i submit need keep ask right questions. new policy direction answer complex question relate rural credit may find recent policy directions. the national development council approve week ago "an approach 11th five year plan" contain extensive reference future policy directions. some extract document may order. on objective challenge "one major challenge 11th plan reverse deceleration agricultural growth 3.2% observe 1980 1996-97 trend average around 2.0% subsequently". "to reverse tend, corrective policy must focus small marginal farmer continue deserve special attention, also middle large farmer suffer productivity stagnation arise variety constraints". "a second green revolution urgently need raise growth rate agricultural gdp around 4%". on finance development "the 11th plan must ensure policy sufficiently flexible support development micro finance. interest rate micro finance sector significantly high bank sector reflect much high cost business. it important remember micro-finance institution charge rate much low rate charge money lenders". bi review 126/2006 3 on agriculture sector policy "the failure organise credit system extend credit lead excessive dependence informal source usually exorbitant interest rates. this root farmer distress reflect excessive indebtedness". "there evidence farm debt increase much fast farm income large issue overhang debt stock, distinct credit flow, even agenda except state governments. admittedly, limit extent bank expect play purely social role today’s competitive environment. however, conservative approach settle debt turn bad, due contingency poor weather prices, even prudential bank serf show bank balance sheet good are, prevent profitable new lending. there several suggestions, range stabilisation fund run centre automatic write-off specify conditions, set state stand professional debt commission examine individual debt (including non-institutional sources) case-by-case basis one time settlement. the 11th plan examine detail impediment stand way social developmental bank suggest innovation improve access speed one-time settlement maintain credit discipline financial prudence". "as farmer adopt new untried technology, increase input intensities, also face large risks." "these relate issue risk management largely non-plan area need address 11th plan. this ideally do concentrate innovation design could help expand insurance manner financially viable without excessive subsidy." it also useful extract statement prime minister dr. manmohan singh, subject meet national development council 9th december 2006. "the 11th plan must give top priority redress weakness agricultural sector. growth agricultural sector le 2% per annum since middle 1990s. with half rural population still dependent income cannot expect inclusive growth revitalise agriculture. it important recognise problem distributional, good farmer well small farmer landless face hardships. though weak group clearly face difficulty need special attention, agriculture whole crisis. we should, therefore, focus achieve high productivity income farmer crop non-crop agriculture." "the approach paper call corrective action several dimension agriculture. water critical input agriculture need re-examine aspect water economy. we spend enough irrigation utilise efficiently." "in addition investment irrigation, must take step conserve water promote artificial recharge rain feed areas." "other issue agriculture agenda identify approach paper relate need focus research specific crops, farm system dry land farm practices, improve extension work close knowledge deficit affect farm productivity; good seed inputs; enhance facility credit, include revamp co-operative credit system; initiative support agricultural diversification effective market solutions; complete unfinished agenda land reform etc". the four deficit before conclude section, i would like invite attention land-mark observation make prime minister address 2nd agriculture summit october 18, 2006, wherein develop four deficit theme. "when review agricultural situation, clear four deficit need bridge. these four deficit (i) public investment credit deficit; (ii) infrastructure deficit; (iii) market economy deficit; (iv) knowledge deficit. take together responsible development deficit agrarian rural economy." 4 bi review 126/2006 "however, need think credit front. while financial system credit need farmers, need raise questions. what farmer need – low rate interest reliable access credit reasonable rates? be exist institutional framework adequate meet requirement farmer diverse lot? do need create new institutional structure shgs, micro finance institutions, etc, provide improve reliable access credit? or need bring money lender form regulation? it necessary find answer question near future." new reality it useful recognise unprecedented structural change fast-growing domestic economy rapidly-integrating global economy. these throw may call new reality meet (a) without lose sight large population currently dependent agriculture; (b) medium-term trend towards low share gdp generation agriculture. thus, short-term action may warrant sensitive aspiration expectation rural areas, medium longer-term strategy take account may term new realities, though old reality great relevance future. there recognition approach paper 11th five year plan, detail reference early speech. kindly let elaborate theme here: first, continuum agricultural non-agricultural activities, term inputs, outputs, supply chains, etc, emerging, highly-commercialised globalise agriculture. second, spectrum financial service deposit taking, lending, insurance, pension, mutual finds, etc, exist several financial intermediary need complement compete even rural areas. bank bank part emerge large whole financial institution activities. third, clear trend towards rural–urban continuum economic linkage process integration need facilitate interest growth equity. hence, segmentation public policy procedure should, best, exception rule. fourth, distinction productive non-productive consumption end, become blur case, consumption smoothen essential. the cash flow risk management become relevant relative ensure monitor end use funds. fifth, today’s technology provide immense opportunity financial intermediary reach large section population, ass price risk better, minimise transaction costs. naturally, would need considerable business re-engineering. finally, dramatic change demand food article supply relate input need constitute basic element new approach. these aspect new approach comprehensively succinctly bring paper colleague dr. rakesh mohan, title " agricultural credit india: status, issue future agenda. (rbi bulletin, november 2004). i want repeat here. issue the new policy direction ndc prime minister clearly indicate criticality improve credit system rightly position one four deficit need address

chairman govern board swiss national bank chairman board director bank international settlements, occasion conference “seventy year after: the final collapse gold standard september 1936”, university zurich, 15 december 2006. these remark prepare help mathias zurlinden, economic analysis unit, swiss national bank. * * * i please honour open conference final collapse gold standard september 1936. this event, 70 year ago, mark one key date history swiss national bank. from middle nineteenth century, gold play pivotal role switzerland's monetary regime. it central, foundation international monetary system anchor swiss franc. and more, people take grant gold-based system would prevail. a hundred year later, second world war, role begin fade, although gold parity franc continue exist 2000. when swiss national bank created, 1907, international gold standard stand potent symbol world characterise free market free movement capital labour. in memorable word keynes “the inhabitant london could secure forthwith, wish it, cheap comfortable mean transit country climate without passport formality, could despatch servant neighbour office bank supply precious metal might seem convenient, could proceed abroad foreign quarters, …, bear coin wealth upon person …. but, important all, regard state affair normal, certain, permanent, except direction improvement, deviation aberrant, scandalous, avoidable.”1when keynes write word 1919, first world war destroy old economic order. the international monetary system shambles, international trade disrupted, social political unrest make hard achieve progress economic issues. at begin war, switzerland, like countries, suspend convertibility currency. such suspension, wartime emergency, line gold standard thinking, long convertibility resume emergency passed. after end war, however, misalignment price level make necessary leave flexible exchange rate place time being. later, switzerland one country restore pre-war parity. in 1924, snb move exchange rate towards goal, finally achieve end year. thus switzerland part gold-exchange standard constitute international monetary system 1925 1931. in 1929, legislation adopt prepare grind return pure gold standard, convertibility note gold coins. while pure standard never actually come about, demonstrate switzerland regard gold natural foundation monetary regime. the gold standard great depression in 1929, outset worldwide economic downturn lead great depression, dominant view swiss government, certainly snb, depression unavoidable. a downturn must run course good time returned, inevitably would. but depression worsened, hands-off policy kind become increasingly difficult pursue. by 1931, situation switzerland aggravate decision large number country come gold. the british suspension convertibility summer 1931 follow country empire scandinavian states. then, 1933, unite state allow dollar float, stabilise one year late vastly low rate. 1 john maynard keynes, "the economic consequence peace", harcourt brace jovanovich, 1920 (reprinted penguin books, 1988). bi review 124/2006 1 with swiss franc greatly overvalue key currencies, option either deflation devaluation. a swiss late realised, would good follow british example. in 1931 1933, however, option see appropriate response. the snb saw britain’s suspension convertibility 1931 regrettable step could last. empirical evidence show britain others fare good devalue currency routinely dismiss argument structure swiss economy different, since highly dependent imports. it seem snb swiss government gold stable element turbulent world, way restore competitiveness swiss economy, therefore, reduce domestic cost prices. a turn out, advocate deflation miscalculate several accounts. for one, foresee deflation would make little progress come years. deflation policy strongly oppose labour special interest groups. back threat referendum, undermine willingness government parliament take uncompromising stance. a consequence, state interventionism rise, self regulation market hamper rigid price cost structure protract depression. at time, appear advocate deflation policy overestimate inflationary consequence devaluation country devalue. the snb repeatedly warn inflationary effect devaluation, yet price increase uk u moderate – world war two – neither country regain pre-depression cpi levels. a result, swiss franc remain overvalue right 1936, extent overvaluation change little throughout period. from modern-day perspective, may appear surprise market largely consider swiss government capable stay course, despite difficulties. most indicator suggest credibility switzerland’s commitment gold standard still intact 1933. it gold stock rise – modestly first 1929 1930, dramatically 1931, many currency come pressure come gold. between 1933 1935 stock decrease significantly still considerably large time devaluation september 1936 1931. the movement forward premium foreign exchange market suggest interpretation. the premium british pound swiss franc modest even time belgium force devalue 1935, well spring summer 1936. thus likelihood devaluation swiss franc see relatively small. nineteen thirty-six the devaluation, come september 1936, widely regard switzerland externally impose step. to many, come shock, since course many year federal council snb constantly emphasise view devaluation remedy. the decision devalue 30 percent take early afternoon september 26, saturday, shortly devaluation french franc. this follow next day radio address nation, give president confederation order reassure swiss people. his famous sentence, "one franc remain one franc," intend boost public's confidence value money. in follow week, monday wednesday, respectively, two chamber parliament endorse decision federal government. after heat debate parliamentary groups, vote issue large along party lines. it interest note policy reversal explain public. the trigger, course, french devaluation. attention draw number consequence french decision. first, devaluation french franc blow export industry tourism. second, unchanged swiss franc parity would increase risk speculative attacks. although gold reserve regard sufficiently large hold time, could assume speculation swiss franc would begin right away. it better, therefore, use gold reserve struggle probability could won. the authority concede policy precede year succeed restore competitiveness economy vis-à-vis country already devalued. finally, point tripartite agreement american, british french government open way new begin cooperative international framework. surprisingly, perhaps, argument put forward crucial one early statements. however, rapidly become clear hope place tripartite agreement might excessive. 2 bi review 124/2006 with devaluation swiss franc, switzerland’s monetary authority renege fundamental commitment. but way monetary standard remain unchanged. the currency continue gold-backed, gold parity continue essential. the operate procedure change and, contrast country period, relationship government central bank alter expense central bank. thus, devaluation see painful setback switzerland's monetary history, dawn new era. fix exchange rates, course, carry bretton wood system post-world war ii world. and although bretton wood differ many way interwar gold-exchange standard, central banker 1930s would adapt without major difficulty world 1960s. the collapse bretton wood system subsequent move flexible exchange rate 1973 far important event snb’s 100-year history devaluation 1936. indeed, crisis international monetary system early 1970s essentially transform snb’s task scope action. switzerland gain full control money supply, price stability become primary objective monetary policy legal framework snb gradually amend accordingly. beyond gold standard a i say outset, role gold fade years. but gold afterlife long cease relevant form conduct monetary policy. first foremost, legal link swiss franc gold continue exist recently. the constitutional change sever link take effect 2000, followed, within year, correspond change relevant law. the new law long include obligation part snb redeem banknote gold – obligation – practice – suspend decades. moreover, abolish minimum gold coverage banknote circulation gold parity swiss franc. with changes, gold finally become normal marketable asset snb. in may 2000, snb begin sell part gold stock. about 50 percent gold own snb sold. i emphasise snb continue hold gold monetary reserve, legal relic gold standard era long immobilize gold stock decades. a second aspect afterlife gold standard presence discussion domestic international monetary standards. in 1970s 1980s, inflation high exchange rate volatile, small vocal group endorse gold standard alternative paper standard post-bretton wood era. judge practice, lose side. there appear widespread consensus – among economist central banker – gold standard generate positive thing cannot provide means. for one, gold standard drawback fix exchange rates. that is, monetary policy cannot use achieve domestic goal parity vulnerable speculative attacks. also, gold standard disadvantage commodity standard. in words, system expensive maintain, also allow supply demand condition commodity question affect general price level. some advocate gold standard propose gold standard international system promote tool solve domestic problems. in particular, argue link gold, provide credible anchor, would keep inflation control. this argument valid far goes, ignore fact gold standard credibility problems. if country tie currency gold, also untie currency gold. this happen 1930s. the market know form expectation accordingly. for reason, country prefer go ways. in recent years, many adopt clear mandate central bank specify price stability primary goal. they try achieve goal form inflation target – implicit explicit. result good far, although attribute improve policy making. some argue globalisation move towards competitive market reduce inflationary pressures, thus make inflation target easy reach. but whatever reasons, result recent year encouraging. i believe long continues, central bank succeed keep inflation control, appeal gold standard remain limited. but i illusion commodity money discuss alternative central bank fail achieve goal inflation rise high levels. bi review 124/2006 3 in concluding, let re-emphasise fact devaluation franc major event monetary history. but although devaluation consider great importance, see herald end gold-backed system. it take 40 year – many difficulty – flexible exchange rate regard feasible option, 60 year gold parity franc removed. today 1936 devaluation remain vivid memory general public. the swiss like remember currency devalue since creation 1850. with without gold standard, history swiss national bank mark continuous search stable anchor. in order protect purchase power money price competitiveness country largely dependent exports, monetary stability override target snb policy throughout one hundred year history. of course, see modern-day perspective, mistake make decision take late – 1936 devaluation see example – fact still use set coin introduce 1850, franc created, show switzerland, thank prudent policy, succeed avoid monetary disorder plague many european country since nineteenth century. 4 bi review 124/2006 durmuş yilmaz: dollarization – consequence policy option speech mr durmuş yilmaz, governor central bank republic turkey, conference “dollarization”, istanbul, 14 december 2006. * * * distinguish governors, academician guests, i would like welcome conference entitle “dollarization: consequence policy options”. i would also like thank share precious knowledge experience us. a conference one activity organize context 75th anniversary central bank turkey, give honor give start it. before continue speech, i would like comment motif lie behind topic conference. although never hyperinflation, we, turkey, experience high chronic inflation past almost 30 year 2001. live long year chronic inflation lead huge loss credibility national currency, important u institution responsible issue banknote maintain stability money. in sense, appropriate indeed discus dollarization depth, i believe. give wide range issue relate dollarization limit time available, i make brief remark concept dollarization general touch upon turkish experience particular. dear guests, dollarization evolve one noteworthy feature globalization last two decades. the integration international financial system, removal restriction capital mobility increase trade volume contribute evolution dollarization. although phenomenon different economy long time, word “dollarization” become well-known term 90’s. in period, number country give foreign currency legal tender status increase official dollarization widely discuss issue. alternatively, unofficial dollarization expand even become pervasive phenomenon wide range countries. the number country ratio foreign exchange deposit total deposit high 30 percent increase 7 1990 46 year 20001. similarly unofficial dollarization turkey also evolve decade. in sense, i focus unofficial dollarization rest speech. distinguish guests, in general, dollarization occur circumstance resident lose confidence currency. the evidence country also show dollarization process advance certain stages. at first stage, domestic currency lose function store value, call “asset substitution”. follow basic level, dollarization take form “currency substitution” refer domestic currency’s loss function unit account mean payment. apart this, dollarization take form like “liability dollarization”, “payments dollarization”, “real dollarization” “financial dollarization”. among these, particularly financial dollarization, describe combination asset liability dollarization, gain grind recent year many emerge countries, include turkey. i cite follow factors, i go examine two main groups, influential dollarization: namely macroeconomic instability market imperfections. in context macroeconomic instability, inflation important issue considered: dollarization rational response economic agent inflation uncertainty reduce confidence domestic currency. in regard, dollarization technically explain high expect volatility inflation-relative real exchange rate portfolio approach. 1 de nicolo, g.; honohan, p.; ize, a. (2003); “dollarization bank system: good bad?”; imf work paper; wp/03/146. bi review 124/2006 1 also, issue high fragile public debt structure along high budget deficit considerable impact dollarization. in case “time inconsistency”, government create inflation order decrease real burden debt, risk premium debt denominate domestic currency tend rises. in essence, push government borrow foreign currencies, hence give rise dollarization. in respect, “original sin” specific term, first coin eichengreen hausmann2 1999; mean country without fully develop financial market oblige borrow foreign currency since borrow national currency long maturity almost impossible. the main factor behind dollarization relate market imperfections. market distortions, fix exchange rate regime accompany high inflation, low institutional quality, poorly develop domestic financial markets, currency-blind financial regulation safety net foreign currency deposit insurance evaluate framework. due imperfections, moral hazard problem arise turn result large demand foreign currency. a studies3 showed, low quality legal political institution lack legal protection domestic creditor provide incentive dollarization. dear guests, now, question care dollarization. before anything else, increase country’s vulnerability shocks. let also mention vulnerability two major sector economy: one arise dollarization private sector one dollarized public debt dynamics. begin private sector, dollarized financial system companies’ balance sheet obviously expose solvency risks, due currency mismatch problem. keep mind risk financial real sector interrelated, bank lend foreign currency firms, earn revenue domestic currency, also indirectly affected. in cases, whole economy become vulnerable shock due amplify risk result dollarization. a recent strand literature country case asian meltdown 1997 2000-2001 bank crisis turkey, emphasize importance vulnerability bring dollarization. moreover, firm adjust price frequently dollarized economic environment depreciation national currency perceive permanent. thus, dollarization lead high pas effect exchange rate price via deteriorate price behaviour firms. ultimately, public sector’s point view, issue debt sustainability highly influence dollarization. in fact, public sector expose problem similar non-trading firm indebted foreign currency4. there doubt dollarized debt adversely affect government’s solvency asset domestic currency. in sense, give high level dollarization, fluctuation real exchange rate might turn apparently sustainable fiscal situation unsustainable one. furthermore, public sector insolvency immediately lead bank sector insolvency domestic bank system hold large claim government. dear guests, before continue turkish experience, i add dollarization deserve special attention central banker’s perspective. a know, choice exchange rate regime critical importance central bank. the empirical find show economy serious balance sheet mismatches, policy maker prefer fix control exchange rate regimes5.. 2 eichengreen, b.; hausmann, r.

(2004); "liability dollarization bank balance sheet channel"; journal international economics; vol. 64(2), p. 247-275. 2 bi review 124/2006 on hand, flexible exchange rate regime provide room monetary policy enable respond external shock freely. it also find use cross-country data bank sector volatile exchange rate reduce share foreign currency denominate loan deposits6, thus contribute prevent dollarization. however, even flexible exchange rate regime choose de jure, dollarization high pas effect exchange rate inflation may cause “fear floating”, thus monetary authority put pressure intervene fluctuation exchange rate costs. in case, policy maker leave big trade monetary policy independence balance sheet mismatches7. obviously, one single commonly accept solution countries. nevertheless, country experience recent year show u tendency choose flexible exchange rate regime assumption vulnerability regard mismatch problem accurately hedged. subsequently, dollarization affect monetary policy increase volatility money demand. thus, traditional transmission monetary policy would work properly central bank direct control foreign currency assets. accordingly, kevin cowan colleague8 mention study, dollarization limit capacity central bank conduct stabilize monetary policy short run large extent limit ability monetary authority gain credibility long run. distinguish guests, have give brief introduction notion dollarization, i would like talk turkish case. a evidence countries, dollarization turkey also take root macroeconomic instability fix predictable exchange rate regimes, inefficient market regulation lack credibility economic policies. in order comprehend dollarization turkey better, would reasonable look macroeconomic instability examine evolution dollarization historical perspective. with 1980’s liberalization policies, barrier foreign exchange transaction commercial bank remove turkish resident allow open foreign exchange deposit 1983. begin date, volume foreign currency denominate deposit start increase. in opinion, liberalization financial system without macroeconomic stability necessary institutional structural change make economy vulnerable shock 1990’s. besides, imprudent fiscal policy result high level public sector borrow requirement put debt sustainability top agenda. along it, accommodative monetary policy lack central bank independence lead high chronic inflation rates. in order tame inflation achieve macroeconomic stability, number exchange rate base stabilization program launched, either interrupt abandoned, cause loss confidence economic policies. accordingly, 1990s early 2000s times, turkey frequently face economic crisis turmoils. average annual inflation realize around 75 percent period 1990 2001. the ratio net public debt gnp reach 90 percent 2001. all these, couple currency-blind market regulation blanket guarantee foreign exchange deposit boost financial dollarization turkey. a close look figure indicate severe dollarization was. from 1990 end 2001 ratio foreign exchange deposit total deposit increase level 25.5 percent 57.6 percent; share foreign exchange deposit broad money supply go 19.7 percent 55 6 arteta, c. o.

remark mr jean-pierre roth, chairman govern board swiss national bank chairman board director bank international settlements, end-of-year medium news conference, zurich, 14 december 2006. * * * a state press release, swiss national bank raise target range three-month libor immediate effect 0.25 percentage point 1.50–2.50%. the snb intend hold rate middle target range time being. economic activity switzerland robust. next year, economic trend likely continue favourable, albeit somewhat le pronounced. this positive effect labour market. the national bank expect real gdp grow 3% 2006 around 2% 2007. decline oil price push back inflation. average inflation 2006 likely stand 1.1%. by lift target range, national bank ensure inflation outlook remain favourable, even view high level utilisation economic resources. on assumption unchanged three-month libor 2.00%, expect annual inflation reach 0.4% 2007 0.9% 2008. if economy perform expected, snb pursue strategy gradual normalisation interest rates. the economy currently excellent shape clearly strengthen past two years. at monetary policy assessment end 2004, suspend normalisation interest rate previously lift three-month libor low point 0.25% 0.75% june september. the three-month libor remain level december 2005 make decision resume normalisation process, give improve economic outlook. today's decision – interest rate hike fifth time succession – confirm stance taken. international environment the change international environment tangible impact since monetary policy assessment september concern price oil. the current oil price clearly high level 78 dollar per barrel brent crude reach august. will see high oil price again? there real conclusive answer question. what witness nonetheless long interruption rise trend since begin 2004. this decline weaken inflation country year ahead. however, economic impact reduce oil price likely low, bear mind oil price still approximately three time high five year ago. at least oil price put additional damp economy since last monetary policy assessment. another significant factor switzerland mark improvement economic situation europe, particular germany. for 2006, growth forecast neighbour country gradually revise upward; 2007, development expect muted. economic activity unite states, however, slow somewhat fast pace anticipated. in 2007, u economy set expand area potential growth again. asia continue dynamic growth pattern. economic situation what situation look like switzerland? a anticipate last monetary policy assessment, economic situation continue improve. it balance broadly based. a late employment figure reveal, momentum economy spill labour market. a great many new job create third quarter, unemployment continue decline. the number gainfully employ person rise approximately 100,000 q3 2005 q3 2006. the unemployment rate likely fall 3% mark begin 2007. the bright outlook labour market improve job security strengthen consumer confidence. expenditure private household soaring. company appear upbeat well. many bi review 123/2006 1 industries, manufacturing, construction hotel trade, report full employment. accord assessment, translate unchanged growth real gross domestic product (gdp) 3% 2006. for 2007, predict decline economic momentum. almost component demand continue grow, albeit moderate pace. private consumption benefit healthy improvement disposable income. equipment investment stimulate high rate utilisation production capacity favourable business outlook many industries. residential construction likely see measure calm. yet increase investment commercial industrial build may offset development extent. the somewhat weak global economic development – though still favourable overall - probably continue positive impact exports. for 2007, expect overall gdp growth 2%. monetary development allow explain development financial market monetary aggregates. two topic merit particular attention: development credit money supply exchange rate. in addition long-term interest rate exchange rates, loan – among thing – play important role change key interest rate transmit economy. what information derive development lend activity? loan register constant growth. mortgage loans, account great majority bank loans, grow rate 5% since 2003. this reflection clearly expansionary monetary policy time. the growth rate mortgage loan gradually slowed, however, slightly 5%. this nevertheless still high growth rate. other loans, however, witness strong growth currently expand 6%. unsecured loans, particular, rise substantially. during phase favourable economic development, great willingness grant unsecured loans. this case 1999, economy find similarly robust state. there long-term correlation loan volume m3 aggregate. loan development typically lag behind development money supply. monetary aggregate grow moderately past three years. the m3 monetary aggregate currently grow modest 2%, m1 m2 even register decline. the measure development monetary aggregate suggest slowdown lending. the development swiss franc attract considerable attention weaken vis-à-vis euro since begin year, although firm u dollar. to gauge effect exchange rate economy, need make use inflation-adjusted exchange rate also weight take account importance individual trade partners. measure real, effective exchange rate, swiss franc today level 2000. in way exchange rate development enter decision-making process? the exchange rate important extent influence inflation, either directly via price import good indirectly via business cycle. volatility swiss franc euro negligible late. this relative calm not, however, deceive us. it necessarily go last. experience show phase weak swiss franc follow period franc exhibit upward trend. financial market player business therefore aware exchange rate risk take. monetary policy decision the inflation outlook form basis monetary policy decision. how look us? a already point consideration economic situation, likely above-average utilisation economic resources. the monetary analysis show lend still grow vigorously swiss franc trend relatively low euro. yet inflation outlook remain favourable. the reason three-fold: first, fall oil price push inflation considerably next year, least first six months. second, open labour market make production flexible, thereby exert favourable influence inflation. third, national bank lift interest rate early stage. the chief contribution today's interest rate adjustment prevent resource over-utilised 2007 2008. a consequence, inflation also likely mute 2008 2009. 2 bi review 123/2006 inflation forecast graph the new inflation forecast show graph red dash line. it cover time span q4 2006 q4 2009 depict inflation forecast assumption interest rate remain 2.00% period time. the dash-dotted green curve show inflation outlook publish interest increase september, base constant three-month libor 1.75%. the red line clearly low green one. this partly due fall oil price partly result dampen effect today's interest rate increase. the level inflation expect 2007 0.4%. however, evident inflation dynamic, effect 2.00% interest rate still expansionary. continuation previous monetary policy with today’s decision increase three-month libor 25 basis points, adhere previous monetary policy course gradual normalisation. in doing, pursue goal continue ensure long-term price stability. if economy perform expected, pursue strategy. observe inflation december 2006 bi review 123/2006 3 inflation forecast september 2006 libor 1.75% december 2006 libor 2.00% the national bank’s 100-year anniversary lady gentlemen, concluding, i would like say word completely different topic: the swiss national bank celebrate 100-year anniversary 2007. we happy celebrate anniversary time switzerland’s economy good shape. and also certain sense pride look back upon long phase price stability. we celebrate anniversary festive, yet modest way. the 100th anniversary general meet shareholder 27 april will, course, turn special event. on 13 june, traditional joint dinner news conference berne, take opportunity toast centenary together you. the highlight celebration launch commemorative publication 21 june follow official ceremony zurich 22 june. i look forward welcome many festivities. we conclude anniversary year two-day event staff berne 25/26 august. apart anniversary events, realise two special project 2007: publication historical time series launch internet platform macroeconomic issues. the new statistical publication series comprise several booklet publish quarterly basis first year irregular intervals. the topic present cover field were, still are, significant formulation implementation monetary policy. the data series go back 100 years, possible. the print publication contain annual figures, additional data series series short interval (quarterly, monthly, etc.) available internet. the publication also include commentary data series, describe calculation method and, topics, historical regulatory background. the first issue – dedicate monetary base monetary aggregate – publish first quarter 2007. in autumn 2007, snb launch iconomix, internet platform intend public use. it take visitor journey discovery world economics. the site "iconomix.ch" contain teach modules, highlight various aspect daily life economic point view. the module mainly design use senior secondary school students. in principle, however, content freely access public large. by set platform, national bank wish contribute good understand economic issue wide public. 4 bi review 123/2006 philipp hildebrand: risk management introductory remark mr philipp hildebrand, member govern board swiss national bank, end-of-year medium news conference, zurich, 14 december 2006. * * * a i report number recent medium conferences, snb update investment policy foreign exchange reserve past years. i would like take opportunity look back, again, motif adjustment outline context conflict objective within investment policy central bank operates. i would like devote special attention risk management, perform key function investment policy snb. look current structure foreign exchange reserves, evident move certain distance traditional structure central bank portfolios. traditional portfolio consist almost exclusively short-term government bond usd well as, possibly, eur jpy. by contrast, snb gradually diversify currency risk past years, lengthen maturity investment invest additional bond category shares. a result adjustments, probably one innovative central bank area investment nowadays. however, i would like stress fact never pursue innovation sake. the adjustment response challenge central bank significant level currency reserve probably face, sooner later. the challenge safeguard protective function currency reserve simultaneously make use earn potential. in simple terms, need first, structure reserve way ensure availability overcome kind monetary crisis, second, invest way ensure generate high possible returns. return must generated, simple reason earn need finance necessary growth currency reserves. furthermore, owe public manage currency reserve professional manner. the protective function currency reserve fundamental. it direct corollary snb mandate, monetary policy take precedence investment policy times. however, without question primacy monetary policy, still leeway great management efficiency, particularly area foreign exchange reserves. we exhaust large portion room manoeuvre. the first development allow u take step 1997 revision national bank act. when new act come force 2004 final statutory barrier regard permissible investment instrument entirely removed. however, investment, walk life, old adage applies: "there free lunch". generally speaking, good earn prospects, high risk losses. certainly, improve currency diversification extremely low-cost lunch snb. nevertheless, introduction additional investment class instruments, together active management investments, bring new risk well. consequently, extend enlarge risk management activity recent years, alongside change investment policies. we run comprehensive risk management operation base best-practice method finance industry also take account special requirement central bank. we attach great importance nurture appropriate risk culture, include ongoing identification, measurement, evaluation, limitation monitor risk well timely, comprehensive report allow regular risk assessment control. a key aspect fact risk management report independently govern board bank council risk committee. this also important operational function area investment policy concentrate one department reason efficiency. one special risk central bank fact investment policy must conflict monetary policies. the liquidity requirement monetary policy well ability investment withstand crisis key parameter investment strategy. also, since unable predict time intervention volume currency reserve needed, cannot resort asset-liability approach strategy definition process. technically speaking, mean cannot determine optimal commitment period investments. in point fact, investment horizon usually relatively long-term, although abruptly shorten event crisis. finally, also pay special attention reputation risk engage specific investments. one bi review 123/2006 1 snb's important asset good reputation credibility. damage reputation could also negative impact monetary policy. consequently, case doubt, avoid investment class instrument may expect damage impact reputation. we also risk-conscious come potential conflict interest. for instance, staff engage practical investment activity shield confidential monetary policy information. effective risk management require relevant risk identify assess regularly, manner unbiased possible. experience show technical failure seldom root serious losses. the great loss result lack risk consciousness, total failure even recognise significant source risk. this danger exist risk assessment restrict exclusively easily measurable quantitative risk variables, exclude area process legal risks, refer 'operational risks'. for reason, also include operational risk assessment. however, pursue broad route, certainly neglect regular quantitative measure assess financial investment risks. no single key figure, take alone, capable provide comprehensive picture risk involved. therefore, risk assessment base range key figure develop measure risk, justification along certain limitations. in order evaluate overall risk investments, use value risk method (var). additional risk analysis also necessary method-related limitation var (it provide information possible extreme losses; moreover tend underestimate risk large losses, particularly time low volatilities). we therefore conduct number additional stress scenario analyses. for risk calculation take account snb's tendency towards long-term investment horizon. the method use ass limit risk link active management investment include 'tracking error' method. this show u extent actual investment deviate give benchmarks. our risk management unit complete up-to-date picture investment positions. this base dedicate it solution aggregate position different supplier system daily basis evaluate accord different criteria. this permit critical development identify good time. within bind set monetary policy, work achieve great possible diversification financial risk attain adequate compensation risk enter into. in words, always ass risk conjunction expect benefit. one example poorly compensate risk, point view swiss franc investor, usd currency risk bonds. our experience expect earn bond currencies, euro sterling, comparable, currency risk significantly lower. consequently, also another important reserve currency available form euro, substantially reduce share usd investment past years. along expansion range permissible bond class addition shares, risk/return profile foreign exchange reserve improve substantially. this help ensure result foreign exchange reserve remain positive past ten years. naturally, part background development favourable interest rate environment prevail since mid-1990s. our analysis overall risk investment show traditional risk factor gold price dollar exchange rate continue dominate. gold pose substantial contribution risk. by way illustration: the gold price term swiss franc fluctuate 10% half year elapse since 1980. in term snb's annual result, mean gold expect contribute +/- chf 3 billion result every second year. by comparison, fluctuation value foreign exchange reserve moderate. the national bank hold 1,290 tonne gold reserves. this mean that, price gold changes, composition currency reserve change value term – risk profile currency reserves. in words, sizeable advance price gold lead substantial increase share gold thus also significant rise risk earn would fluctuate. at time, gold reserve represent special asset which, historical point view, likely provide crucial protective function period extreme crisis. 2 bi review 123/2006 what conclusion draw considerations? the 2004 revision national bank act give snb leeway investment policy. since then, make use leeway within bind set monetary policy, least respect foreign exchange reserves. an essential prerequisite – remain – risk management operation commit best-practice method take full account special feature central bank considerations. the requirement monetary policy continue strong impact snb investment policy future. the room improvement risk/return ratio limited. a result function, currency reserve encompass large financial risks, comparable return relatively low. compensation gold price risk dollar exchange rate risk, particular, relatively poor. it therefore inevitable tight bind set snb profit distribution, exist distribution reserve exhausted. bi review 123/2006 3 lars nyberg: the riksbank's cooperation sida speech mr lars nyberg, deputy governor sverige riksbank, seminar arrange sida, stockholm, 13 december 2006. * * * let begin thank opportunity briefly describe riksbank’s work aid issues. i would also like say particularly please see nobel peace prize year award effort financial sector bangladesh. otherwise, financial sector often sadly forget aid contexts. foreign aid develop country often concentrate combat poverty forms, course commendable. but easy forget financial sector function institution necessary achieve long-term stable economic growth. a high inflation rate one country may, instance, quickly lead great poverty among large section population even best type poverty combat measure time counteract. a well-functioning central bank responsible monetary policy therefore make significant contribution regard combat poverty. the riksbank cooperate sida year build reinforce capacity within central bank sri lanka, vietnam uganda. we call foreign aid, quite simply “staff exchange programmes”. a central bank world le things, albeit rather different ways, always reward see others work. we therefore send expert various field country cooperation, instance, expert design payment system make model inflation forecasting. the central bank send staff u discussion issue talk things, deregulate financial system sweden 1980s, important information transparency one run central bank independent responsibility monetary policy. recently receive young employee stay u period month six week “internships”, can, instance, learn write financial stability report scratch. long-term think central concept programme. it take time understand one another’s reality create relationship lead cooperation base mutual trust. we usually say take least five years. central bank governor always involve various way (both riksbank central banks), important give programme adequate status. in view, important colleagues, consultants. we rarely able stay long week, central bank manage. we conduct large-scale investigation document leave behind us; describe experience allow colleague consider whether experience may use work. we sweden riksbank achieve quite lot turn well years, also do lot feel hindsight could do better. for instance, proud come bank crisis begin 1990s, get it. this type experience textbook course convey way people actually happened. our colleague usually interest everything, particularly learn others’ mistakes. we also consider important riksbank’s employee learn cooperation – one idea behind “staff exchange programme”. encounter activity similar workplace’s, conduct different external condition always give reason consideration reflection. our programme therefore great professional interest employee return trip new often unexpected experiences. our cooperation sida excellent, although sometimes hear spend much money expected. a expert trip cost much. the cooperation embassy also important. we see link central bank work best staff swedish embassy respective country actively involve regularly follow happen respective banks. at begin year, sida commission evaluation riksbank’s cooperation far sri lanka vietnam. the evaluation show riksbank’s effort central bank successful appreciate recipients. the fact colleagues, things, responsibility, one key factors. there many bi review 123/2006 1 consultants; colleague hard find. the long-term think behind cooperation also important factor. we merely make analysis, write report disappear. we still continue discussion whenever necessary. the problem indicate evaluation administrative nature. for instance, difficult find place foreign aid context low-cost project like this, really follow set pattern aid efforts. finally, i mention riksbank allocate resource internal business plan next year extend cooperation central bank sida’s cooperate countries. we consider work interest reward hope also help colleague make institution stronger. 2 bi review 123/2006 nil bernstein: financial crisis – talk relation financial stability denmark speech mr nil bernstein, chairman board governor national bank denmark, conference mark 125th anniversary first danish save bank act – save bank act 1880, copenhagen, 12 september 2006. * * * thank invite participate celebration 125th anniversary first danish save bank act. i ask speak danmark nationalbank's task relation financial stability main head "financial crises". financial crisis involve serious costs. a survey two economists, hoggarth saporta, cover 43 financial crisis develop develop country show average cost society amount around 15 per cent gdp. it also costly affair save one major bank order prevent economic collapse. a domestic case point rescue plan assist landmandsbanken 1922-23. it cost treasury kr. 40 million, accord historian søren mørch equivalent 2/3 total government budget social expenditure time. so, danmark nationalbank's task relation financial stability? if go back danmark nationalbank act 1936, state danmark nationalbank shall "maintain safe secure currency system country, [...] facilitate regulate traffic money extension credit". there thus doubt task relation financial stability. however, act say shoulder responsibility. perhaps well, since task change time. at danmark nationalbank define financial stability state exists: financial system robust enough problem experience within sector spread prevent financial market function provider capital financial services. in words, focus function financial system. smooth provision money society prerequisite well-functioning danish economy, also basis effective implementation market-oriented monetary policy. it important avoid problem financial enterprises, depositor shareholders, also society large. problem within one bank tend spread financial institution – rate affect reputation. depositor investor may loose faith financial system. a domino effect created. how danmark nationalbank actually solve task relation financial stability? i would like show examples, i present challenge. firstly, seek analyse key risk financial sector. this include situation unlikely arise, could potentially involve high cost society. we perform stress test financial system order calculate large adverse impact exist buff able absorb. we publish analysis annual financial stability report view open dialogue public authorities, bank sector representative risk development within financial sector. some call "open mouth" operations. on basis analysis stress tests, recent financial stability report conclude financial institution still robust, currently black cloud horizon could threaten financial stability denmark. we become accustom see bank make record-high profit every year. an important factor context high growth lending; rate growth last see mid-1980s. a chart 1 shows, high-growth period mid-1980s follow gradual erosion credit quality, increase loss provision subsequent period. bi review 122/2006 1 i say history repeat itself. we forget new basel ii capital accord, take effect begin 2007, increase focus banks' credit risk management. when danmark nationalbank ass banks' credit risk, start point failure-rate model develop basis 400,000 annual account file danish company period 1995 2002. this model similar use bank basis advance method may use basel ii. the failure-rate model estimate probability company fail. a chart 2 illustrates, analysis base failure-rate model show certain tendency bank high growth lend recent year also high credit risk lend portfolios. there exceptions, still need aware link high growth lend risk subsequent high losses. another topical issue examine large gross debt danish household compare household countries. chart 3 show debt ratio gdp. the high gross debt ratio, combine extensive use adjustable-rate mortgage-credit loans, make household vulnerable rise interest rates. we calculate households' additional mortgage interest burden interest rate rise. on average, mortgage interest expense increase 1.2 per cent household's gross income interest rate rise 1 percentage point, considerable variations. some household financially challenge interest rate increase percentage points. this could impose loss bank mortgage-credit institutes. nevertheless, overall assessment development homeowners' exposure rise interest rate threaten function financial system – financial stability. to put bluntly, failure number household meet obligation credit institution necessarily financial stability problem. in past year, imf visit denmark connection fsap, financial sector assessment program. a member countries, imf assess structure danish financial system. a report publish within month so. in connection fsap stress test conduct ass whether danish financial system robust cyclical changes. the basis stress test include danmark nationalbank's macro model, mona, stress test module estimated. the worst-case scenario apply imf involve slowdown domestic economy, exacerbate monetary-policy tighten ecb. house price fall 30 per cent gdp 3 per cent 3-year period. a strong cocktail indeed. the result danmark nationalbank's stress test show chart 4, blue line represent actual, historical loss banks, yellow line show model calculation historical development, break line expect development, give stress scenario. accord calculations, banks' average loss would increase almost 1.5 per cent loan guarantees. this somewhat low early 1990s, loss provision reach 2.5 per cent average. overall, danish financial system therefore reasonably robust. nevertheless, bank may suffer substantially high losses, bank early 1990s lose 10 per cent. stress test give high priority future assessment financial stability. our ambition learn bank affect economy stress situations. another task danmark nationalbank relation financial stability ensure denmark secure effective financial infrastructure safely use settlement payments, security trade financial transactions. danmark nationalbank statutory obligation oversee payment settlement system denmark. part imf's fsap ass core element danish financial infrastructure relation international standards. the imf recommend changes. danmark nationalbank work responsible system ensure necessary improvement made. however, blindly adhere recommendations. for example, imf recommend establish buff pool ensure settlement security transaction retail payment even large participant able settle payment obligations. danmark nationalbank find best safeguard ensure 2 bi review 122/2006 participant easy flexible access liquidity, combine participants' large portfolio security pledge collateral loan danmark nationalbank. consequently, currently see need special measure ensure settlement danish systems. a third area look situation financial system affect dramatic external events. these could act terrorism, widespread epidemics, natural disaster situation financial system threaten collapse. danmark nationalbank chair task force ensure coordination financial institutions' business continuity plan situations. finally, danmark nationalbank act lender last resort danish banks. danmark nationalbank extend loan bank urgently need liquidity cannot procure market, even though bank solvent. fortunately, seldom call that. should situation occur necessary rescue ail bank, danmark nationalbank's position market-based solution found. nothing definite say beforehand danmark nationalbank's role. it would depend concrete assessment situation – direct indirect – consequence danish bank system danish society. however, look danmark nationalbank do previous occasions. in number cases, danmark nationalbank play role connection public intervention help ail bank – provide financial assistance expertise. each time situation serious could potentially negative impact danish bank system cause foreign bank lose faith danish banks. the initial step provide stand-by liquidity facility give bank question room manoeuvre. however, danmark nationalbank also provide guarantee creditor jointly private bank – often basis government guarantee. in several cases, involvement danmark nationalbank conducive solution participation private banks. a classic example role lender last resort episode summer 1992 rumour unibank face difficulties. since denmark's second large bank, certainly bank significance danish bank system. the episode coincide bank crisis nordic country mention danmark nationalbank's report account 1992: "early summer, rumour arise unibank face difficulties. these rumour immediately disprove danish financial supervisory authority, order counter liquidity problem abroad danish bank consequence rumour concern bank comply solvency requirements, nationalbank make stand-by agreement unibank supply liquidity necessary, cf. nationalbank's press release june 21, 1992." a know, unibank pull through. finally, i would like draw attention challenge facing. in bank area, financial integration advance level nordic region rest eu, large bank branch subsidiary nordic countries. the prominent example nordea, significant market share nordic country (except iceland) – denmark's case almost quarter deposits. eu legislation contribute harmonise basis conduct activity financial sector remove barrier cross-border operations. this part process create single financial market eu. nordea currently operate subsidiary structure, national authority still responsible supervision oversight activity country. for nordea danmark, responsibility lie danish financial supervisory authority. this change nordea – announce year ago – choose merge one bank branch various countries. in case, authority home country – presumably sweden – would principal responsibility activity denmark, danish bi review 122/2006 3 authority currently supervise e.g. danske bank's activity swedish branch. that eu legislation designed. this legislation suitable bank relatively small branch another country. however, swedish authority cannot hold responsibility nordea's impact financial stability denmark. it still denmark's responsibility financial system function – even insight almost one quarter danish bank market. consequently, danmark nationalbank opinion large branch involve may affect financial stability another member state, need bind cooperation authority home country host country eu legislation provide for. both supervisory authority central bank nordic country conclude collaboration agreement relate cross-border financial enterprises. we long-standing tradition nordic cooperation, presumably able negotiate necessary insight large danish branch bank domicile nordic countries, vice versa. however, system also design handle business integration north south within eu. in respect, tradition cooperation le well-established among nordic countries. it may therefore necessary rethink eu legislation individual member state still empower safeguard financial stability – even presence large foreign branch whose operation may impact financial system. the eu need legal handle ensure authority host country gain necessary insight large branch foreign bank. the problem naturally acute, amendment eu legislation take time, know need may arise. this issue pursue cooperation danish authorities. 14-12-2006danmarks nationalbank2chart1.

debate number fields, trade policy taxation policy, indigenous affair infrastructure. interestingly enough, list publication ceda’s website include overtly financial focus. i say criticism – perhaps reason invite central bank governor speak regularly cover set issues! but seem appropriate, give ceda’s core focus economic development, address questions: role finance economic development growth? how financial system contribute? how financial event sometimes detrimental economic growth? what do ameliorate risks? what risk face present? history the growth take grant modern world actually fairly

(1967), (ed.) bank early stage industrialization: a study comparative economic history, oxford university press, new york, p. 58. 7 for example, bank england grant charter – establish britain’s first limit liability bank entity – 1694 raise £1.2 million government fund expenditure war france. 8 bagehot, w. (1873), lombard street: a description money market, henry s. king co., london. 9 it mere coincidence, way, come time macroeconomic instability concern 1960s, 1970s 1980s receded. good macroeconomic stability coincide with, probability encouraged, dramatic increase size complexity financial activity. bi review 122/2006 3 financial economic trend australia past decade the prominent financial development past decade has, course, change structure balance sheet households. much say description brief. the essence story early 1990s, two decade chronically high inflation australia ended. interest rate decline result. in fact, return level last see low-inflation period 1960s. but intervene period, course, australian financial system change recognition, result liberalisation, competition innovation. no long potential borrower house bend knee stern-faced bank manager, way early period low rates. now, lender competitive pressure grow balance sheets. have pursue corporate borrower 1980s, rather mix success, look household source growth. we recall advertisement one major bank formerly stern manager practise say ‘yes’ mirror morning. so mid 1990s, household sector able incline demand house finance, financial institution will supply it. it hardly surprise ultimately result household carry much debt, well high level assets, before. it might happen early course inflation interest rate different. nor surprise expansion finance relatively short period year associate high price dwellings. i find persuasive argument change plan development regulation raise cost new build – is, cost add dwell stock. it plausible this, turn, add price exist dwell could reasonably substitute new dwellings. but seek explanation price 8 million exist dwell across country increase much, surely give prominent role halve cost debt easy availability. these trend also add aggregate demand economy, via additional construction renovation spending, generally expansionary impact rise asset value broad household spending. whereas dwell investment average around 5 per cent gdp 1970s 80s, reach peak nearly 7 per cent gdp 2003/04. household also expand consumption fast income. for time, trend helpful period adverse shock abroad impact. over past two three years, effect gently faded. we see decline spend housing, slow growth household borrow consumption spending, change fairly modest compare early episodes, partly region country resource boom continue boost house price household demand. the run-up household borrow also raised, occasion, quite naturally, question sustainable was, whether build-up exposure household sector financial system could impair financial macroeconomic stability future time. considerable attention give recent year set questions, reserve bank elsewhere. we believe rise debt was, itself, likely trigger economic downturn. that said, high leverage would, event economic downturn occur reason, probably make least households’ spend behaviour responsive decline income would past. precisely set issue recently address part imf’s financial sector assessment program (fsap). that program wide-ranging exercise, fsaps are, point view key component macroeconomic stress test. the reserve bank, financial stability department head keith hall, coordinate exercise, involve imf team, apra, australian treasury risk-management area five large bank – whose co-operation express thanks. the result include september financial stability review, also release imf part fsap report october. in brief, test involve scenario featuring: large fall house prices, recession, big rise unemployment, sharp depreciation exchange rate rise fund cost financial institutions. this design specifically test resilience financial system several key element underpin business strategy past decade removed. 4 bi review 122/2006 in scenario, adverse effect would come directly mortgage portfolios; good deal would come business portfolios. face loss income, indebted household would likely cut back consumption sharply order keep mortgage payments. hence, business supply discretionary consumer market would feel effect quite quickly. in test conducted, result estimate decline around 40 per cent banks’ aggregate profit around 18 months, end three-year scenario, profitability remain 25 per cent low start point. that said, institution remain well truly solvent capital position regulatory minima. in part, reflect strength business balance sheets. a bank work scenario, strength mean significant cutback household spend cause widespread loan default business sector. overall, result are, within limitation type exercise, reassuring. before take much comfort them, however, need enter caveats. for start, scenario seem demand one first blush, predicate recession australia rest world. that would be, unprecedented, least unusual, realistic scenario australia suffer downturn simultaneously with, largely result of, international downturn could well challenge environment one assume tests. a second factor everyone take part simulation know scenario involve economic recovery, assumption. they could factor modelling. but real recession, always come point many people confident recovery, affect behaviour. it unknown lender sufficiently lack confidence reluctant take risk new borrowers. that would fee back economy, deepen decline slow recovery. thirdly, quite large difference result across banks. while difference may partly explain variation structure individual bank balance sheets, also appear reflect different approach use bank model outcomes. there nothing wrong – one approach definitely right another wrong. but fact vary technique produce significantly different result mean must fair bite uncertainty around individual estimate. hence, result provide comfort, limit confidence would replicate real-world downturn. we are, however, confident exercise worthwhile, would worth point. the council financial regulators, body bring together apra, asic, treasury reserve bank chairmanship rba governor, view system-wide stress test conduct regular basis, though course scenario would need change time. this also view imf fsap report. we indicate ceo participate bank would look type stress test roughly every two years, i look forward support this. look ahead, increase prominence private equity leverage buyout activity point interest. to date, trend probably cause bite excitement straight number would suggest warranted, since lbos account relatively small proportion corporate merger acquisition australian company 2006. but perhaps reason attention feel trend could continue time. in essence, many transaction base two fundamental premises: return equity high, recent year unusually stable well; cost debt low. those offer high price business essentially bet that, next several years, enhance return increase leverage. to extent, may also feel private-ownership structure thing improve long-run performance company current shareholder would tolerate short-term damage earn share prices. but mainly, strategy one leverage. if analysis correct, corporate leverage, associate exposure around financial system, could rather prominent issue next five year couple decades. go back fsap stress test moment, likely result would worry leverage corporate sector considerably higher. but shall leave detail discussion issue another occasion. for now, time conclude. bi review 122/2006 5 conclusion finance growth go together. it accident acceleration growth industrial revolution associate development modern bank capital markets. by token, disruption financial sector costly real economy, clear history. the role public policy respond disruption forcefully occur preserve stability system, good time work hard foster climate careful risk assessment relevant institution markets. for past 15 year so, financial system australia work remarkably smoothly assist economy. a large change household sector’s balance sheet make household sensitive change circumstances, financial institution continue perform strongly. the challenge remain institutions, us, understand risk change new environment, remain aware may stage face le forgive circumstance enjoy past decade. we need also alert shift wind area corporate leverage seem occurring. i suspect talk time come. in interim, i wish merry christmas happy, prosperous – stable – new year. 6 bi review 122/2006 jens thomsen: european bond market euro speech mr jens thomsen, member board governor national bank denmark chairman efc-subcommittee eu government bond bill markets, european government bond summit, brussels, 25 october 2006. * * * my remark focus reflection relate integration process european bond market experience post-emu era. in particular, i highlight successful evolution european government bond market follow introduction common currency. the establishment european monetary union january 1, 1999, pave way integrate european bond market. in pre-emu era, different euro area countries' government bond yield differ substantially. a example, yield spread germany 10-year government bond segment range 700 bp 1990's (see slide 1). yield spread however expect decline along introduction euro primarily due elimination exchange rate risk. prior 1999, attempt make anticipate magnitude post-1999 yield spread emu member states. sparsely evidence currency area provide insight relation anticipations. the provincial bond market canada one candidate area use comparison canadian province similar characteristic forthcoming emu countries, include explicit rule mutual federal bail out. the spread bond issue different canadian province canadian government bond much low euro area spread prior euro range "only" 60 bp. notwithstanding decline spreads, canadian evidence indicate euro area spread would completely disappear (see slide 2).1considering post-1999 era retrospect, euro area spread indeed decline significantly since introduction euro (see slide 3). in fact, euro area spread small today actually low one observe canadian provinces. this may due high level liquidity emu countries' issue well somewhat good credit rat among emu countries. regard credit ratings, may influence generally large tax base central government addition low labour mobility europe cause tax base secure. the convergence yield among euro area country yet observe markedly 10 new eu member state even though erm2 member clearly experience low spread (see slide 4, lithuania slovakia erm2 members). the large decline euro area yield spread reflect increase integration european fix income market take place since 1999. the market integration process view four dimensions. firstly, fact european government bond market consist many issuer contrary correspond u market imply european market divide per se. however, development comprehensive network electronic trade platform mitigate issue, i.e. predominant part emu issuer today connect system (see slide 5). secondly, establishment primary dealer network emu country has, among thing (e.g. secure liquidity), enhance integration bond market. a quick glance various emu countries' lists' official primary dealers, show large part primary dealer present almost every government bond market, indicate high level market integration across country (see slide 6). thirdly, harmonization market convention well national tax treatment occur since introduction euro. e.g. convention government bond t-bill market concern settlement date, definition business day day count basis, coupon frequency coupon calculation method almost completely harmonize across euro area country today (see slide 7 1 see "yield differential future emu", monetary review, may 1997, danmark nationalbank, pre-1999 analysis expect emu spread base evidence canadian provinces. bi review 122/2006 1 8). this make european fix income market transparent accessible international investors. fourthly, product development also contribute market integration process. for example euro-denominated interest rate swap (irs) market grow become large world absolute terms. in relative terms, euro-denominated irs market today twice size usd-denominated irs market (see slide 9). a result liquid irs market, fix income instrument across euro area today typically price use standardize euro swap curve combination yield curve stem heterogeneous government bonds. consequently, euro-denominated irs market obtain similar benchmark role one hold u treasury usd-denominated market, respect price fix income instruments. the emergence liquid swap curve thereby serve alleviate issue fragmentation european fix income. the small yield spread still exist today emu member state primarily attributable difference liquidity credit risk issuers. consequently, emu era draw attention two factors. regard credit risk, increase focus may serve increase disciplinary effect financial market policy makers. an inspection relationship development national debt-to-gdp ratio sovereign yield spread relative germany 1999 – 2006, indicate improve creditworthiness emu member state since 1999 explain decline spread (see slide 10). however, credit risk one factor determine size spread therefore view isolation. in order examine role respectively credit risk liquidity embed current yield spread across emu countries, one may use price credit default swap (cds) split yield spread credit risk liquidity. the fact price cd approximately equal credit risk premium underlie bond make possible. under assumption yield spread emu-members purely explain difference credit risk liquidity, liquidity risk premium may define residual yield spread deduct credit risk premium (see slide 11). the calculation show yield spread today affect noticeable credit risk greece, italy portugal, whereas liquidity primarily play role small issuers. in addition government bond market, introduction euro also form expectation concern development euro-denominated corporate bond market. though market increase fairly much term total outstanding post-1999 period, corporate bond market continue account small fraction euro-zone debt market (see slide 12). corporate finance tradition europe favour bank model may one explanation this. it recognise well develop mortgage market make strong contribution debt security market number european countries. nevertheless, increase number entity outside euro-zone issue bond denominate euro. indeed, role euro international debt security market increase substantially since 1999. for broadly define international debt security (i.e. security either issue outside respective currency area issue within currency area target international financial markets), euro account global share 47 percent compare share 37 percent u dollar. the euro's share rise 18 percentage point since january 1999. the high share international market compare size national segment reflect high relative importance international financial market euro (see slide 13). the establishment well function european government bond market important contribution european single market support efficient allocation resource economic growth. the contribution government bond market euro area therefore underestimated. 2 bi review 122/2006 bi review 122/2006 3 4 bi review 122/2006 bi review 122/2006 5 6 bi review 122/2006 bi review 122/2006 7 8 bi review 122/2006 bi review 122/2006 9 david dodge: improve financial system efficiency – need action remark mr david dodge, governor bank canada, economic club toronto, toronto, ontario, 11 december 2006. * * * two year ago, i give speech toronto i deal theme efficiency relate economy general financial system particular. today, i want return theme financial system efficiency. in so, i draw material late financial system review (fsr), publish last week.1 this publication, familiar it, one way bank contribute soundness financial system. the fsr report development trend financial system abroad, summarize recent research bank staff financial sector policies, promote discussion strengthen financial system. in short, goal fsr improve financial system efficiency stability. when i speak two year ago, i stress u need keep mind goal efficiency, canadian financial institution market need efficient possible. since time, global financial service sector continue undergo sweep changes. the integration global financial market continuing. exchange financial institution consolidating, new financial instrument constantly developed. all change way global market operate, important implication competitiveness efficiency canadian market institutions. today, i want talk canada respond developments. in so, i hope underline important efficiency everybody concern canada's long-term economic health. but i begin, i start say financial system efficiency important. when financial system operate peak efficiency, investor receive high risk-adjusted return investments, borrower minimize cost raise capital. with efficient financial system, economic resource allocate productive investments. another key reason promote efficiency financial system importance financial sector industrial base. the financial service sector represent 6 per cent canada's gdp. however, long-term health sector may risk unless act increase efficiency competitiveness. i'll return topic minutes. but point i want stress efficient financial system crucial achieve sustain economic growth prosperity canada. efficiency macroeconomic policy let's examine canada's macroeconomic policy support efficiency. a central banker, i start brief look monetary policy; particular, policy inflation targeting. a may know, last month bank federal government renew joint inflation-targeting agreement another five years, end 2011. since canada adopt inflation targeting, see number important economic benefits. inflation low stable, inflation expectation become well anchor 2 per cent target, short term, also long term. with low stable inflation, along important policy improvements, peak valley business cycle become le pronounced, economy show increase flexibility adjust various type shocks. because consumer business great certainty future purchase power save income, borrower pay much small premium compensate investor inflation risk. in short, see low cost borrowers, predictable return investors, efficient allocation resources. but always look see way make good performance even better. this bank launch concert research program see already successful inflation-targeting framework improved. in particular, want find answer two questions. first, would cost benefit inflation target low 2 per cent? second, 1 available at: http://www.bankofcanada.ca/en/fsr/index.htmlbis review 121/2006 1 would cost benefit replace current inflation target longer-term price-level target? we hope see intensive research issues, conduct inside outside bank, next three years. this would give bank government canada enough time examine result take account next renewal agreement 2011. canada's fiscal policy been, continue be, important support efficiency markets. governments, federal provincial, work hard achieve fiscal balance work reduce ratio public debt gdp. continue progress front support efficiency allow investor remain confident proceed investment subject excessive taxation future. this additional confidence lead good allocation resources. a well-functioning market federal debt also important canadian fixed-income market support efficient allocation resources. so bank, role fiscal agent government, continue work federal government market participant support liquidity smooth function market government debt. finally, bank canada support efficiency role promote safe sound financial system. we legislate responsibility oversee systemically important clear settlement systems, responsibility - one share federal provincial agencies, regulators, market participant - actively foster safety soundness financial system. when everyone confident financial system safe, le need either keep precautionary resource spend arrangement guard effect financial instability. canada's clear settlement system judge sound.2 in addition, design operate use relatively small amount liquidity compare system countries. and free resource put productive use elsewhere. our main goal area guard costly financial instability. recently, discussion unite state european union potential threat financial stability pose hedge funds. a colleague david longworth point recent speech3, bank look effect hedge fund stability markets, particular, market canada. it important central bank others continue monitor hedge fund potential systemic risks. but judgment, appear reason sound alarm time. this say increase transparency hedge fund might improve efficiency markets, additional disclosure might increase investor protection. these issue examine security commission others. so, sum macroeconomic side, framework monetary, fiscal, financial stability policy second none world, job support encourage efficiency. but own, sound macroeconomic policy enough. canada also need microeconomic policy spur competitiveness support efficiency. let review structural issues. i'll begin talk financial institutions, address issue efficiency security markets, enforcement, pension regulation, fixed-income markets. efficiency microeconomic policy financial institution when i raise topic financial institution efficiency two year ago, i note follow 1964 porter commission, canada become world leader term modernize regulation. parliament pass legislation create regulatory framework financial institution lead great competition, low costs, improve efficiency. over years, right policy place, canadian financial institution capitalize comparative advantage provide regulatory framework become world leader efficiency. 2 see, example, imf's assessment http://www.imf.org/external/np/rosc/can/payment.htm3 available at: http://www.bankofcanada.ca/en/speeches/2006/sp06-18.html2 bi review 121/2006 but roughly past decade, several country greatly improve regulatory frameworks, erode comparative advantage. a number foreign institution become good place exploit new technology order enhance efficiency, offer client new instrument combination services. it rapidly-changing environment financial institution must compete. clearly, want financial institution remain major economic driver canada, need make sure regulatory framework operate encourage competition innovation, prevent maximize efficiency. a minister finance say economic update, "competition drive firm become efficient, invest new technologies, introduce new product service benefit consumers." this lead question whether financial institution efficient. some observer examine financial service sector whole, use data national accounts, note productivity sector appear low countries, particularly unite states. for u canada, improve productivity increasingly important issue, assessment concern. so, bank canada, look carefully issue. while work complete, publish initial find current fsr.4 at risk oversimplifying, i stress two main findings. the first term net operate income per worker asset per worker, employee canadian bank least productive counterpart u.s. bank comparable size. canadian bank also well measure efficiency. but second main find that, compare u.s. banks, unexploited economy scale canadian banks. this suggest canadian bank le efficient regard scale operation bank could reap economy scale, would efficiency benefit flow canadian economy. overall, research conclude legislative regulatory change benefit efficiency canadian financial services. this show importance remove remain restriction inhibit competition efficiency, provide little benefit term financial soundness. our find still preliminary, far research confine banks. but data become available, plan complete research extend part financial sector. security market now let turn need support efficiency regulation security markets. in past, i suggest canada would best serve develop security regulation take account size complexity firm reporting. the principle canada's regulatory framework must apply firms, must good as, good than, country. but application rule can, tailor appropriately take account size complexity company. historically, canada's public market do well fund small company efficiently. it important future market continue. canada try develop comparative advantage security regulation small firm remain market choice companies, canadian foreign. the unite kingdom make major stride area consolidate regulatory authority ten year ago and, recently, begin implement principles-based set rule simplify administrative process issuers. authority euro area move unify regulatory regimes. even unite states, treasury secretary henry paulson call streamline u.s. regulatory authorities. against backdrop, canada increasingly look stick middle 20th century, position well compete 21st century. for sake efficiency, need single, uniform framework security regulation. rule need apply uniform way across country, tailor appropriate firm sizes, provide appropriate protection investors. 4 j. allen, w. engert, y. liu.

fullani, governor bank albania, the fifth international bank forum, athens, greece, 6 december 2006. * * * honorable dr. margret doyle, dear mr. chairman, distinguish participants, before start speech i would like briefly address perennial question stand heart quest: “are prosperous time ahead us?” it come assistance old say one ancient philosophers, eupides: “prosperity full friends”. a gather friends, i believe positive answer question. i would like thank “the economist conferences” invite bank albania important forum. it great pleasure today. the topic speech economic reforms. i take opportunity express view past future bank financial reform albania region. the topic new course. however, reform implementation dynamic process must reflect change expectation future development domestic global markets. therefore, always open discussion need new idea solutions. central bank important contributor economic reform implementation. they welcome support also generate reform capital, labor, product markets. such reform ripple effect go beyond economic benefit long run stable growth financial stability. i believe positive spillover materialize south east european region’s prosperity economic political integration european union. the bank albania constant generator supporter reform institutionally provider stable prices, sound macroeconomic condition financial stability. it make undeniable fact financial integration experience forefront european union integration process. it ease challenge speed process european integration albanian embrace wide popular consent. like many transition economy bank reform albania implement integral part structural reform undertake transform albanian economy market orient economy. continuous improvement, along approval implementation new bank legislation supervisory regulation; liquidation privatization process state own banks; foreign ownership; change bank financial markets. foreign bank important push factor toward increase efficiency, number, quality, coverage financial intermediation. new entries, merger acquisition recently alter market structure asset liabilities. reform bring big european player capital market, increase confidence economy region whole. however, presence foreign bank replace need legal institutional framework. moreover, late development bank financial market might foster additional risk factor relate asymmetric exposure, issue home host supervision financial safety net foreign bank dominance. these challenge expect financial development region outline scope structure reform future. so, please allow briefly present view future trend regional financial markets. financial market region become part broad global development fuel financial integration, liberalization, financial innovation. the lucrative regional market consolidation process impose vertical financial integration region. le ten european bank headquarter vienna, athens milan dominate regional bank markets. the process financial integration continue, make region integrate european countries. financial system lead road financial integration positive spillover process spread over. financial market continue bank dominated. non bank financial sector grow rapidly, bank continue major players. they help build need bi review 121/2006 1 financial infrastructure nonbanking financial activities, support growth economies. not long ago i ask friend mine recently return migration 15 years: “why come back”? his answer simple true: “it important i like live – say – important opportunity are”. a gap live standard close albanian see opportunity flourish albania, come back. they bring important human capital managerial skills, gain country work. many albanian emigrant stage migration cycle see potential benefit process. it role bank match human capital necessary financial capital provide financial service develop entrepreneur skills. this role come naturally greek commercial bank operate albania, i take opportunity thank early confidence albania. they natural partner new entrepreneur familiar culture, probably long history operate respective greek offices. the fact venture could also involve greek capital case pure joint investment make one argument support observation. accord bank albania surveys, greek company rank first size capital invest albanian economy, hold second place number foreign direct investments. the involvement bank finance activity play positive role shift balance loan portfolio retail consumer credit toward production activity industry agriculture. at time, might also fuel growth rate credit economy, already experience rapid growth last two years, raise concern macroeconomic financial stability. the result reform limit openness development domestic financial market. they generate price financial stability, sustain economic growth, assist institutional build increase confidence. these development attract interest of, bring big financial group region general albania particular. a i mention entry big financial groups, consolidation process follow since continue grow. what observe right market big fish eat small fish; big fish eat big fish european market implication host countries. however, process far over, gigantic fish (global player) might enter region eat big fish. last least, merger among domestic bank well. despite increase concentration ratio come merger acquisitions, start observe increase competition market. this competition increase efficiency, introduce new service products, low spread generate positive spillover economic activity. while make good precondition foster financial stability, sufficient condition increase financial discipline. currently, activity financial institution commercial bank limit scope; however, start see sign financial conglomeration. we doubt trend grow continue future. it bring innovation, new financial instrument product market. along this, rapid growth credit debit card well system payment continue grow. while instrument might subside even reduce use cash, trend must take account. transition economy region lucrative markets. they grow substantially fast traditional european market offer impressive prospect high profit significant growth. to give example, return bank activity albania last two year around 20 percent. these positive prospect eagerness compete quickly beyond rational limit profit market share may create potential risks. if manager lose sight entire picture, financial constrains, competition might result mismanagement, nonperforming loans, bank problems. therefore, room sloppy managerial attitude. it important managerial staff must challenge which, materialized, could complex self-regulated develop markets. it important act enbloc engage regional project infrastructure include financial ones. we great confidence ability bank system promote best bank cautionary practices; however, i believe preemptive action need ensure late observe trend hamper financial stability. therefore, cannot neglect improve legislative, regulatory prudential measure major element financial sector reform albania. 2 bi review 121/2006 in regard, new draft bank law prepare bank albania; likewise, new law security introduce shortly. in addition, effort underway revise legislation pension investment funds, draft law payment systems, substitute several sub-legal act issue bank albania now. this process aim gradual harmonization bank legislation acquis communnautaire. to address issue increase competition, poor managerial practice safeguard stability, bank albania work toward establish credit registry, revise regulatory framework capital adequacy ratio credit risk management, increase on-site supervision, improve stress-testing models. follow financial stability assessment program (fsap) recommendations, separate entity “the authority financial supervision”, establish recently supervise securities, insurance pension fund markets. last least, i would like address implementation basel ii accord. while shape financial market, i believe pose challenge bank system u moment. we initiate implementation new accord, currently pragmatic approve adoption well understand element basel ii implement safe way. now, i would like shift attention important pillar bank reforms: role central bank monetary policy. the contribution bank albania economic reform come also maintain stable price help ensure financial stability. over last five year bank albania stability orient monetary policy generate low stable inflation; also ensure medium long run inflation expectation well contained. the economic growth robust around 5-6 percent gdp, enjoy high degree financial stability. reflect broadly nature monetary policy i would say always focus maintain price stability use control monetary aggregate intermediate target. current account foreign exchange transaction liberalize early stage transition along adoption free float exchange rate regime. indirect instrument use transmit interest rate liquidity signal market. repo rate become signal tool short term interest rate repo reverse-repo operation use manage liquidity. reform conduct monetary policy grant great flexibility bank determine volume term lend deposits. the bank albania provide necessary condition ensure sustainable economic growth stable prices; however alone guarantee objective fulfilled. all positive development take place presence well contain fiscal expansion, element sound fiscal policy bold structural reforms. bank system become important provider domestic finance government. commercial bank play major role it, direct finance bank albania limit address issue independence deficit monetization. recently government introduce market paper five year maturity. in addition, consent imf, government shortly issue euro denominate government securities. bank albania welcome development certification cautious responsible fiscal policy. at time call prudence proper address additional risks. it undeniable however, late development achieve watchful eye international monetary fund. imf important element reform albania. it presence memorandum understand sign framework esaf current blend prgf eef programs, enhance credibility economic reform serve external anchors. however, economy grow current agreement end 2009, soon get full ownership economic policy reduce role imf article 4 agreement. the bank albania prove track record competence, credibility professionalism service economy. these three element provide necessary condition support guarantee achievement economic goal stable price boost credibility albanian economy; but, hold responsible behavior players. i convince need find implement clear domestic foreign anchor preserve credibility reform future. for way ahead focus effort identification utilization key element state, politics, markets, institution general public could efficiently play role domestic anchors. a part preemptive action, bank albania carefully consider possibility bi review 121/2006 3 launch fully fledge inflation target regime monetary policy midterm. this conditional decision base upon result current ongoing research, evaluation precondition build capacities. other possible anchor memorandum understand ministry finance public education consider well. on foreign side see numerous prestigious partner understand concern appreciate value fiscal discipline. they enjoy power virtue influential voice. some already partner reform shape future ones. european integration process association stabilization agreement sign provide nominal anchors. in addition, sovereign rat independent country report could also play role. the bank albania intend establish open line communication adopt instrument automatically start build pressure late. my personal conviction european accession lie natural process, central bank vital role play. this approach would mutual benefit speed convergence toward european standards, make political decision natural outcome efforts. to make process effective central bank european institution continue dialogue, even surveillance, supporting, assist guide u fundamental economic financial legal, infrastructure. this process would increase responsibility accountability make albania eligible partner. let conclude discussion quote euripides says: “much effort, much prosperity”. thank again. 4 bi review 121/2006 jean-pierre roth: implication business new international monetary order address mr jean-pierre roth, chairman govern board swiss

maria rueda maurer, international research technical assistance unit, swiss national bank. * * * it pleasure discuss one important issue times: financial globalisation implication international business. globalisation, landmark dawn 21st century, open new opportunity growth prosperity planet. it create fantastic investment perspective firm compete internationally. but also change rule game bring new challenges. today, success survival international business determine ever private level. because good capital free move across national borders, protection risk emanate globalisation matter private strategy only, rather public policy. this, i think, main difference globalise world today partition world separate nation past. let share view globalisation financial market concomitant emergence new monetary order change play field international business, role you, private sector, we, central banks, call play. what new international monetary order? the globalisation finance lead important change way monetary authority implement policies. over last decade witness reorganisation world monetary order, choice polarise around two extremes: one extreme flexible exchange rate regime one usa, uk switzerland, extreme fix regimes, monetary union choose country belong euro area. peg still exist, especially asia, le numerous past. let talk first different national monetary choice meet challenge financial globalisation. we leave behind u time international monetary relationships, base bretton wood system fix exchange rates, give u nice feel order security. the keeper order central banks, main job maintain exchange rate currency within narrow band. international businesses, part, free plan ahead, unaware nasty surprise emanate sudden currency exchange disorders. and yet world apparent security collapsed. by late 1960s, fundamental misalignment major economy become great support international fix exchange rate system and, reluctantly, accept security take grant become unsustainable fiction: ever grow international capital mobility, peg regime become increasingly difficult maintain. the reason easy understand: capital free move across national borders, price currency determine like price internationally trade asset – interaction expectation actor operate beyond border issue country response variable beyond area influence national authorities. by early 1970s, central bank could ignore basic truth, 1976 major currency floating. the bretton wood system dead. in decade followed, many countries, especially develop ones, try cling dollar peg periodic adjustments, effort bring stability currencies. they operate economist call intermediate exchange rate regimes. the series costly crisis 1980s 1990s prove dangerous path could be. the adjustable peg able channel thin capital flow completely ineffectual come contain huge capital flow bi review 120/2006 1 encounter globalise world. by 1996, flexible exchange rate predominate africa, asia, middle east, non-industrial europe western hemisphere.1today, many advance country emerge economy adopt flexible exchange rate regime.2 by i understand regime exchange rate basically leave fluctuate response market pressures. true, central bank can, circumstance intervene mitigate extreme exchange rate fluctuations. but main objective central bank domestic price stability, exchange rate stabilisation. this system switzerland choose pursue. it serve u well. exchange rate flexibility allow national budgetary monetary police diverge one country another. it confer monetary authority room adapt policy domestic economic realities. a different strategy follow many european countries. abandon domestic currencies, country fully insulate intra-zone exchange rate fluctuation adopt hard possible peg, monetary union. monetary policy responsibility supranational institution, ecb. towards rest world, euro allow float, necessary adjustment price member countries, rather take place via movement exchange rates, expect occur mean change wage product price increasingly integrate economic area. thus bretton wood system replace order sorts, two extreme choice increasingly dominate national strategies. at one extreme, country opt let currency float determine market forces. at other, country opt full insulation exchange rate fluctuation renounce monetary independence. consequence new international monetary order what consequence new international monetary order? the first positive consequence undoubtedly increase stability international monetary system. indeed, one paradox time apparent disorder today far stable apparently order system past. in presence high capital mobility, two resilient exchange rate regime today dominate planet: flexible regime hard pegs. the move away intermediate regime reduce probability costly financial crisis. thus priority give central bank price stability abandonment exchange rate anchor result – rather le – foreign exchange stability. evidence recent potentially destabilise events, like recent war lebanon, pass without major international financial turmoil. this bring new division labour private public agent i mention introduction. the increase stability base new contract society monetary authorities: those country that, like switzerland, choose flexible exchange rate regime, base success monetary policy credibility transparency central banks. we long – thankfully – attempt construct kind maginot line contain international capital flows. this effort would costly ineffectual maginot line was. instead we, central banks, endeavour provide market timely, clear reliable information view future path inflation effect may interest rate policy. you, private sector, analyse information act upon it. unlike situation past, international business lead believe future path exchange rate predictable, today realistic situation business community know shock occur, predictable way central bank react them. in addition stable international monetary order, new paradigm bring u many advantages: low inflation, low real interest rate low international spread additional achievements. after decade high inflation even recurrent episode hyperinflation various emerge markets, last ten year mark low stable inflation 1 caramazza, f. j. aziz (1998), fix flexible? get exchange rate right 1990s', imf, economic issue 13, april. 2

benefit, course, income long erode price growth. but producer also gain price stability help plan ahead. low inflation confidence central bank policy have, turn, reduce uncertainty future price developments. the low inflation risk premium allow even industrial economy grow low real interest rate past. and, finally, unambiguously beneficial consequence new international monetary order allow efficient distribution capital. at time current polarisation exchange rate regime come being, financial globalisation intensified. capital control lift grow number develop countries. in 1970s, net flow private capital world's poor country amount little 1% host-country gdp.3 by end 1990s, percentage figure grow factor three. today, broad acceptance benefit derive financial liberalisation. indeed, gain expect free market international capital substantial. global finance allow good allocation world resources, enhance prospect growth nations. for rich country world, new investment opportunity finance expand need age populations. young poor nation obtain access capital realise high potential growth. this basic teach theory international capital flows. financial integration, together technological advance financial market financial market instruments, benefit world large allow capital invest return higher. where risks? but benefit also entail new risks. indeed, despite good institutions, good policy good markets, feel vulnerable nowadays use past. how reconcile image prosperous safe world increase feel danger? to extent, sense vulnerability simply reflect advance telecommunication enhance awareness world. i geologist therefore i cannot tell whether experience earthquake 30 40 year ago. however, i know nowadays i inform within hours, minutes, earthquake, flood terrorist attack occurs, even remote corner planet. our sense security bind affect kind information. but matter perceptions. globalisation mean switzerland indeed affect event occur india, brazil,

– natural manmade – occur. let return global finance. i say world today le likely witness recurrent crisis afflict many country 1980s 1990s. i convince case. by choose flexible exchange regime, choose resilient system, many pursue sensible macroeconomic policy help navigate turbulent water safely past. but i also convince country equally well prepare cope free capital mobility. for country weak institution underdevelop financial sectors, globalisation mean rather le vulnerability. international financial integration may look like bless foreign capital flow in, look like curse foreign investor head door. the present monetary order resilient previous regime fix exchange rates, crisis still occur, occur likely extensive spread rapidly. and globalisation, course, go far beyond financial integration. global company locate world. they deal different legal frameworks, different business cycles, different political realities. the range risk meet international business thus far

globalisation challenge business management. it entail many source uncertainty also offer many vehicle cope risk. can beat new risks? no. we must prepare face them. we insure risks, cannot predict next blow come from. i think important characteristic times. what increase insecurity. we are, many respects, safe past. this, i hope, i manage convey you. my conviction world today good manage past and, sense, safer. what increased, however, magnitude potential crisis. this i refer uncertainty. the big challenge international business today learn live uncertainty. and domain still way go. nowadays, difficulty deal uncertainty permeate discussion responsibility different private government agents. i perceive understandable – opinion misconceive – nostalgia world use appear safer, thank regulation. we hear demand construction barrier protect menace world outside – demand regulation ensure financial provider cannot go bust, cannot cheat, cannot make wrong decisions; trade barrier ensure survival domestic producers; restriction movement person protect workers… the problem dreamworld cocoon never work work. and even worse, work, possible barricade possible menaces, would still good off. globalisation great opportunity make u rich safer. but learn live risk. in fact, main danger i see today live stable world, safe world, may become complacent. and i must say i feel comfortable recent development financial markets. the surge asset price many countries, absence volatility many market low level credit spread show today's investor unprecedented confidence future strong appetite type risks. for sure, economic fundamental improve industrialise emerge countries. it is, however, hard believe world economy enter phase last accelerate prosperity. we must remain alert. no major financial crisis shake world recent year spite iraq war, rise oil prices, major natural disasters, various terrorist attack permanent rumour new terrorist attacks. the resilience

liikanen: the change financial environment latin america global imbalance remark mr erkki liikanen, governor bank finland, iii high-level seminar eurosystem latin american central banks, madrid, 4 december 2006. * * * latin american country successfully reduce traditional source vulnerability recent years. however, despite strong fundamentals, possible disorderly adjustment global imbalance would pose serious risk region. against background, key question are: 1) well country region prepare possible future crises, 2) authority make economy good withstand adverse economic conditions, 3) role latin america play adjustment global imbalances? to address questions, i focus comment three set issues. first, i discus briefly development lead significant reduction external vulnerability latin american countries. here i want highlight role strengthen institutional framework reduce economic vulnerability. second, i try sketch possible disruptive adjustment scenario order examine type policy need prepare economy turbulent economic conditions. finally, i talk bite latin america's role adjustment global imbalance highlight key difference region emerge market economy main contributor global imbalances. 1. reduce vulnerabilities: importance institutional framework the background research paper prepare ecb staff (“financial vulnerability latin american economies: reappraisal") give excellent overview evolution financial vulnerability latin american countries. the trend narrow spread decompose three factors: reduce risk aversion, ample global liquidity improve country specific factors. the paper also analysis role different country specific factor play development. such analysis highly valuable assess nature risk ahead appropriate policy response mitigate them. the increase appetite risk main driver behind narrow spread emes, yet effect particularly pronounce latin america. however, country region, sensitivity global risk aversion diminish recent years. similarly, region seem become le sensitive change global liquidity condition approximate shape u yield curve. the increase importance country specific factor imply great degree policy independence go forward. for central banker comfort research show monetary policy regime direct significant impact sovereign bond spread legal independence central bank significant impact reduce external vulnerability. these result fit well observe developments. it clear exceptionally benign global environment major factor. however, equally clear many latin american country reduce traditional source vulnerability (i.e., heavy reliance external source finance, weak fiscal regime volatile macroeconomic environment) impressive improvement economic policy support institutional arrangements. despite significant difference countries, general trend clearly distinguishable: • the quality fiscal policy improve considerably many country use favourable condition fiscal consolidation make fiscal policy transparent. • monetary exchange rate policy framework become sophisticate credibility policy improve inflation rate declined. flexible exchange bi review 120/2006 1 rate arrangement inflation target underpin continue trend strengthen institutional independence central banks. • there also considerable progress develop financial markets. many country able satisfy increase share finance need domestic sources, partly foreign investor become active domestic debt markets. moreover, country successfully place local currency issue international markets. in general, divide line domestic international capital market become le clear "original sin" become le constraint. • there significant progress debt management practices. many country region, example brazil, take advantage change environment systematically make debt stock le vulnerable exchange rate interest rate movement (e.g. change denomination issue long term fixed-rate debt). favourable market development contribute strengthen external positions. help high commodity price generally buoyant demand exports, current account swing surplus many country region. appreciation domestic currency vis-à-vis u dollar support reduction external indebtedness. however, despite advances, clear vulnerability remain. public debt stock decline significantly measure percent gdp indexation debt remain significant many cases. consequently, public finance remain vulnerable adverse economic shocks. a recent concern country build potentially excessive exposure domestic financial system domestic (non-indexed) government debt. before turn discus policy implication remain vulnerabilities, i would like emphasize advance institutional development never take granted. indeed, see past, populist policy easily cause setback area. therefore, crucial maintain political support institutional reform foster financial development. in regard, strong property right legal system enforce contract quickly fairly particular importance. a many may recall, discuss topic globalization financial stability last summer banco de españa safeguard two factor deem essential avoid pitfall financial liberalization. 2. possible "anatomy" next crisis policy increase resilience shock the region weather relatively well may-june 2006 financial market correction, episode show become immune shock emanate global financial system. while "threshold pain" clearly improved, resiliency system face pronounce external shock remain untested. against background, room complacency. so, might serious external shock look like authority prepare economy eventuality? the region seem particularly vulnerable combination possible recession u fall commodity prices. let elaborate bite examine anatomy bad case scenario. i want emphasize i mean imply type outcome likely would inevitably important difference country region. nevertheless, risk overgeneralise oversimplifying, i think useful examine vicious circle might unfold order draw policy conclusions. • a recession u (triggered e.g. wide decline house asset prices) would hit hard latin american country strong trade link us, mexico, venezuela ecuador. a weak u demand could well lead significant slowdown china. direct impact region might relatively limit direct trade link china latin america relatively weak, despite increase recent years. however, indirect effect via low global commodity price could become quite pronounced. • increase u interest rate investors' reduce appetite risk could lead significant widen emerge market spreads. liquidity market could dry cause spread widen investor would try reduce

interest rate possibly also weak currencies. possible problem domestic financial system could also force government incur additional liabilities. country sound fiscal position well-anchored inflation expectation might scope countercyclical policies. such country could also benefit flexible exchange rates. however, case fiscal position sound enough, currency mismatch debt would erode potential

latin american country vs. east asian emes oil exporter latin america's role resolution global imbalance generally perceive minor relative east asian economy oil exporters. a number factor help explain difference. the obvious difference many east asian emes relatively recently join global economy experience catch phase characterize particularly rapid growth (and oil exporter benefit high oil prices). latin america's integration global economy take place gradually extend period time (and many time process interrupt economic crises.) the east asian economies' truly impressive growth mask underlie weaknesses, least reflect lack development certain areas, bear global imbalances. to highlight factors, instructive compare contrast latin american country east asian economy country major generator global imbalances. east asian economy oil export emes characterise large current account surpluses, capital export u (reflected accumulation reserves) thus contribute long-term interest rate u also globally. whereas latin american country characterise lack major external imbalances. set aside already mention difference growth rate phase catch process, main factor underlie differences: bi review 120/2006 3 1) level financial market development. many east asian economy oil exporter suffer chronic shortage high quality domestic investment asset relative domestic demand. moreover, domestic financial system generally weak intermediation capacity. this phenomenon contribute low interest rate us, thus fuel demand contribute build surplus country satisfy demand exports. a know, e.g. ricardo caballero write several interest paper phenomenon asset shortage role global imbalances. many latin american country experience rapid development domestic debt markets. also, compare big surplus countries, financial system good job financial intermediation. 2) these two group country also different save consumption patterns. this reflect partly already mention difference financial system also important differences. many "surplus countries" poorly develop social safety net compare bulk latin american countries. the lack safety net force people save much save channel abroad, give lack suitable instrument home. in many surplus countries, notably china, market consumer good still underdeveloped, albeit develop quite rapidly. 3) there also strike difference monetary exchange rate regimes. in country main "culprits" surpluses, regime tend base external anchor seem many country currently undervalue currency peg u dollar. in latin america, increase prevalence flexible exchange rate regimes, often combine inflation targeting, make significant exchange rate misalignment le likely. furthermore, regime policy stance determine domestic condition external anchor. deficiency institutional development many surplus generate country always receive sufficient attention discussion global imbalances, tend focus excessively need exchange rate adjustment. a latin american countries, one could say many important respect country already contribute resolve global imbalance implement sound policy build institutional infrastructures. in regard, many surplus country lot learn experience latin american countries. 4 bi review 120/2006
