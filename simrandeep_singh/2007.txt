Ben S Bernanke: The economic outlook Testimony of Mr Ben S Bernanke, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, before the Joint Economic Committee, US Congress, Washington DC, 28 March 2007.  *      *      * Chairman Schumer, Vice Chairman Maloney, Representative Saxton, and other members of the Committee, thank you for inviting me here this morning to present an update on the outlook for the U.S. economy. I will begin with a discussion of real economic activity and then turn to inflation. Economic growth in the United States has slowed in recent quarters, reflecting in part the economy’s transition from the rapid rate of expansion experienced over the preceding years to a more sustainable pace of growth. Real gross domestic product (GDP) rose at an annual rate of roughly 2 percent in the second half of 2006 and appears to be expanding at a similar rate early this year. The principal source of the slowdown in economic growth that began last spring has been the substantial correction in the housing market. Following an extended boom in housing, the demand for homes began to weaken in mid-2005. By the middle of 2006, sales of both new and existing homes had fallen about 15 percent below their peak levels. Homebuilders responded to the fall in demand by sharply curtailing construction. Even so, the inventory of unsold homes has risen to levels well above recent historical norms. Because of the decline in housing demand, the pace of house-price appreciation has slowed markedly, with some markets experiencing outright price declines.  The near-term prospects for the housing market remain uncertain. Sales of new and existing homes were about flat, on balance, during the second half of last year. So far this year, sales of existing homes have held up, as have other indicators of demand such as mortgage applications for home purchase, and mortgage rates remain relatively low. However, sales of new homes have fallen, and continuing declines in starts have not yet led to meaningful reductions in the inventory of homes for sale. Even if the demand for housing falls no further, weakness in residential construction is likely to remain a drag on economic growth for a time as homebuilders try to reduce their inventories of unsold homes to more normal levels.  Developments in subprime mortgage markets raise some additional questions about the housing sector. Delinquency rates on variable-interest-rate loans to subprime borrowers, which account for a bit less than 10 percent of all mortgages outstanding, have climbed sharply in recent months. The flattening in home prices has contributed to the increase in delinquencies by making refinancing more difficult for borrowers with little home equity. In addition, a large increase in early defaults on recently originated subprime variable-rate mortgages casts serious doubt on the adequacy of the underwriting standards for these products, especially those originated over the past year or so. As a result of this deterioration in loan performance, investors have increased their scrutiny of the credit quality of securitized mortgages, and lenders in turn are evidently tightening the terms and standards applied in the subprime mortgage market. Although the turmoil in the subprime mortgage market has created severe financial problems for many individuals and families, the implications of these developments for the housing market as a whole are less clear. The ongoing tightening of lending standards, although an appropriate market response, will reduce somewhat the effective demand for housing, and foreclosed properties will add to the inventories of unsold homes. At this juncture, however, the impact on the broader economy and financial markets of the problems in the subprime market seems likely to be contained. In particular, mortgages to prime borrowers and fixed-rate mortgages to all classes of borrowers continue to perform well, with low rates of delinquency. We will continue to monitor this situation closely. Business spending has also slowed recently. Expenditures on capital equipment declined in the fourth quarter of 2006 and early this year. Much of the weakness in recent months has been in types of capital goods used heavily by the construction and motor vehicle industries, but we have seen some softening in the demand for other types of capital goods as well. Although some of this pullback can be explained by the recent moderation in the growth of output, the magnitude of the slowdown has been somewhat greater than would be expected given the normal evolution of the business cycle. In addition, inventory levels in some industries – again, most notably in industries linked to construction and motor vehicle production – rose over the course of last year, leading some firms to cut production to better align inventories with sales. Recent indicators suggest that the inventory adjustment process BIS Review 31/2007 1 
may have largely run its course in the motor vehicle sector, but remaining imbalances in some other industries may continue to impose some restraint on industrial production for a time. Despite the recent weak readings, we expect business investment in equipment and software to grow at a moderate pace this year, supported by high rates of profitability, strong business balance sheets, relatively low interest rates and credit spreads, and continued expansion of output and sales. Investment in nonresidential structures (such as office buildings, factories, and retail space) should also continue to expand, although not at the unusually rapid pace of 2006. Thus far, the weakness in housing and in some parts of manufacturing does not appear to have spilled over to any significant extent to other sectors of the economy. Employment has continued to expand as job losses in manufacturing and residential construction have been more than offset by gains in other sectors, notably health care, leisure and hospitality, and professional and technical services, and unemployment remains low by historical standards. The continuing increases in employment, together with some pickup in real wages, have helped sustain consumer spending, which increased at a brisk pace during the second half of last year and has continued to be well maintained so far this year. Growth in consumer spending should continue to support the economic expansion in coming quarters. In addition, fiscal policy at both the federal and the state and local levels should impart a small stimulus to economic activity this year. Outside the United States, economic activity in our major trading partners has continued to grow briskly. The strength of demand abroad has helped to spur strong growth in U.S. real exports, which rose about 9 percent last year, and a robust world economy should continue to provide opportunities for U.S. exporters this year. Growth in U.S. real imports slowed to about 3 percent in 2006, in part reflecting a drop in real terms in imports of crude oil and petroleum products. Despite the improvements in trade performance, the U.S. current account deficit remains large, averaging 6-1/2 percent of nominal GDP during 2006. Overall, the economy appears likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters. As the inventory of unsold new homes is worked off, the drag from residential investment should wane. Consumer spending appears solid, and business investment seems likely to post moderate gains.  This forecast is subject to a number of risks. To the downside, the correction in the housing market could turn out to be more severe than we currently expect, perhaps exacerbated by problems in the subprime sector. Moreover, we could yet see greater spillover from the weakness in housing to employment and consumer spending than has occurred thus far. The possibility that the recent weakness in business investment will persist is an additional downside risk. To the upside, consumer spending – which has proved quite resilient despite the housing downturn and increases in energy prices – might continue to grow at a brisk pace, stimulating a more-rapid economic expansion than we currently anticipate. Let me now turn to the inflation situation. Overall consumer price inflation has come down since last year, primarily as a result of the deceleration of consumers’ energy costs. The consumer price index (CPI) increased 2.4 percent over the twelve months ending in February, down from 3.6 percent a year earlier. Core inflation slowed modestly in the second half of last year, but recent readings have been somewhat elevated and the level of core inflation remains uncomfortably high. For example, core CPI inflation over the twelve months ending in February was 2.7 percent, up from 2.1 percent a year earlier. Another measure of core inflation that we monitor closely, based on the price index for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy, shows a similar pattern. Core inflation, which is a better measure of the underlying inflation trend than overall inflation, seems likely to moderate gradually over time. Despite recent increases in the price of crude oil, energy prices are below last year’s peak. If energy prices remain near current levels, greater stability in the costs of producing non-energy goods and services will reduce pressure on core inflation over time. Of course, the prices of oil and other commodities are very difficult to predict, and they remain a source of considerable uncertainty in the inflation outlook.  Increases in rents – both market rent and owner’s equivalent rent – account for a substantial part of the increase in core inflation over the past year. The acceleration in rents may have resulted in part from a shift in demand toward rental housing as families found homeownership less financially attractive. Rents should begin to decelerate as the demand for owner-occupied housing stabilizes and the supply of rental units increases. However, the extent and timing of that expected slowing is not yet clear. 2 BIS Review 31/2007 
Another significant factor influencing medium-term trends in inflation is the public’s expectations of inflation. These expectations have an important bearing on whether transitory influences on prices, such as changes in energy costs, become embedded in wage and price decisions and so leave a lasting imprint on the rate of inflation. It is encouraging that inflation expectations appear to be contained. Although core inflation seems likely to moderate gradually over time, the risks to this forecast are to the upside. In particular, upward pressure on inflation could materialize if final demand were to exceed the underlying productive capacity of the economy for a sustained period. The rate of resource utilization is high, as can be seen most clearly in the tightness of the labor market. Indeed, anecdotal reports suggest that businesses are having difficulty recruiting well-qualified workers in a range of occupations. Measures of labor compensation, though still growing at a moderate pace, have shown some signs of acceleration over the past year, likely in part the result of tight labor market conditions. To be sure, faster growth in nominal labor compensation does not necessarily portend higher inflation. Increases in compensation may be offset by higher labor productivity or absorbed – at least for a time – by a narrowing of firms’ profit margins rather than passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. In these circumstances, gains in nominal compensation would translate into gains in real compensation as well. Underlying productivity trends appear generally favorable, despite the recent slowing in some measures, and the markup of prices over unit labor costs is high by historical standards, so such an outcome is certainly possible. Moreover, if the economy grows at a moderate pace for a time, as seems most likely, pressures on resource utilization should ease. However, a less benign possibility is that tight product markets might allow firms to pass some or all of their higher labor costs through to prices. In this case, increases in nominal compensation would not translate into increased purchasing power for workers but would add to inflation pressures. Thus, the high level of resource utilization remains an important upside risk to continued progress in reducing inflation.  In regard to monetary policy, the Federal Open Market Committee has left its target for the federal funds rate unchanged, at 5-1/4 percent, since last June. To date, the incoming data have supported the view that the current stance of policy is likely to foster sustainable economic growth and a gradual ebbing in core inflation. Because core inflation is above the levels most conducive to the achievement of sustainable growth and price stability, the Committee indicated in the statement following its recent meeting that its predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected. However, the uncertainties around the outlook have increased somewhat in recent weeks. Consequently, the Committee also indicated that future policy decisions will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.  Thank you. I would be happy to take your questions.  BIS Review 31/2007 3 
Mario Draghi: Reflections on monetary and financial policy – Governor Baffi’s monetary policy Address by Mr Mario Draghi, Governor of the Bank of Italy, at the Centro di Economia monetaria e finanziaria “Paolo Baffi”, Università Commerciale Luigi Bocconi, Milan, 15 March 2007. *      *      * The “Paolo Baffi” Centre for Monetary and Financial Economics has invited me to give this talk to revive the custom of the “Reflections on Monetary and Financial Policy” that had been interrupted for a decade. I thought it would be appropriate to start off the new series by exploring the personality and monetary policy of Paolo Baffi, to whom the centre is dedicated. Baffi was Governor of the Bank of Italy during five of the most difficult years this country has known. It is not easy to discuss the problems that beset monetary policy in those years or the decisions that were taken using today’s language. Since then, the conditions of Italy’s economy and politics have changed radically, as have the prevailing opinions on the link between money and economy, the role of the central bank, and its objectives. The lexicon of monetary economics has mutated. The years in which Paolo Baffi was at the helm of the Bank of Italy, a period of exceptional economic and political difficulties, marked the start of the transition towards our present manner of interpreting and conducting monetary policy. Reviewing those years can help us recall the importance of institutional conquests that we now take for granted. Intellectual roots and institutional framework Paolo Baffi was one of the first professional economists to be taken on by the Bank of Italy; it was 1936. He took over the leadership of the Bank in August 1975, just a few days after Guido Carli’s resignation, and was the first Governor to have made his career within the Bank. Many of his writings bear witness to the intellectual evolution and choices of an economist whose outlook embraced equally theoretical interests and policy concerns. In 1935, after Italy invaded Ethiopia, Baffi’s mentor, Giorgio Mortara, carried on a campaign against the international sanctions imposed against Italy from his Giornale degli Economisti. Baffi, twenty-four at the time, came out in favour of international economic cooperation, anxious about the nationalistic illusions entertained by his professor, who retorted with accusations of “internationalistic illusions”. The young man had obviously seen further ahead than the older one, who was soon to suffer the effects of nationalism transformed into anti-Semitism. What interests us here, however, is the fact that Baffi attributed his sound judgement at the time to a “diet of classical texts of economic liberalism”.1 This left an enduring mark on his training as an economist that was reflected in his subsequent theoretical output, less so in his policies, which were influenced by the formidable constraints existing during his time as Governor. Economic liberalism, according to Luigi Einaudi, was not so much an economic doctrine as a way of reasoning, which takes an apparently simple rule and, through systematic use of theory, derives indirect and distant effects that are often the opposite of their proponents’ intentions. Undoubtedly, one of the main characteristics of Baffi’s thinking was his focus on indirect effects, on the links between the various elements of the economic system. His concern to make plain the relation between real and financial phenomena was at the root of the “national monetary balance sheet” developed in the aftermath of the War, the embryo of today’s financial accounts. In 1953 Baffi was a member of the committee appointed to pronounce on the reform of IRI’s bylaws and its future role. While the majority of the committee favoured the creation of a Ministry for State Holding Companies and an increased role for IRI in promoting economic growth, Baffi and a few others held that the solution lay above all in sound regulation of the market.2                                                      1  P.

BIS Review 31/2007 1 
The 1960s and 1970s were, by admission of Baffi’s predecessor, Governor Carli, the period when political power was most closely interwoven with monetary, financial and supervisory policy; it was also the most dangerous time for the repercussions on the performance of the economy, both then and later.3 In the first half of the 1970s, and particularly between 1973 and 1976, a dense web of constraints and rules developed regarding banks’ portfolios, subsidized credit, interest rates, and capital movements. Baffi never came out openly against this, but his scepticism, rooted in his reading of classical texts on economic liberalism, was no secret to anyone inside the Bank of Italy. To understand the central bank’s modus operandi in those years we must consider the powerful influence exerted by the predominant economic culture. It was not a market culture. Its influence, combined with vested interests, often directed economic policy towards solutions that did not follow the market. In Italy, Keynesianism only acquired a foothold in academia towards the middle of the 1960s and the version that gained credence among policy-makers had a distinctly more dirigiste flavour than that prevailing internationally: not only did economic policies to support demand earn plaudits from politicians and economists, but more generally, above and beyond the actual Keynesian propositions, they saw broad government intervention in economic activity, especially investment, as the means of perpetuating the growth of the 1950s. Development, industrialization and social and distributive conflict were the issues that attracted the best minds and the vision of political leaders. What was asked of monetary policy was to produce growth, capital formation, the narrowing of the gap between Italy and its European partners, and balance-of-payments equilibrium. Price stability was a secondary concern. The autonomy of the central bank was not viewed as essential to stability. In Italy, interest focused on the real economy; the role of money, the causes and effects of inflation were not common subjects of inquiry. Baffi’s studies on money thus constitute a notable exception. The discussions that Franco Modigliani had in 1967 with the top management of the Bank of Italy during the development of the econometric model exemplify the difficulty of describing the problems of monetary policy at that time using today’s language and criteria. In those meetings Governor Carli defined the Bank’s main objective as that of fostering a sufficient level of income to allow investment that would close the distance between Italy and the other members of the European Economic Community.4 The Governor mentioned price stability only as a subordinate aim, and it was interpreted, moreover, solely as alignment with the level of international prices, that is to say an objective for the defence of competitiveness. The pre-eminence of the objective of price stability did not have formal sanction; it was not shared by public opinion, nor was it comprehended in academic and political circles. Monetary management was increasingly entrusted to administrative controls on credit, namely the ceiling on the growth in bank lending (introduced in 1973) and the requirement that banks invest a part of their portfolios in long-term fixed-income securities. Initially designed for allocative purposes and to support private investment, these instruments were almost immediately employed for macroeconomic purposes and to facilitate the financing of the Treasury. Effective in rapidly curbing aggregate demand, they continued to be used until the end of the 1980s in spite of their allocative cost and the fact that they soon came to be circumvented. Treasury bills were the main instrument for financing the Treasury. At the auctions it was customary for the Bank of Italy to submit a bid guaranteeing that all the securities on offer would be taken up at the floor price. Since this was often set above the levels at which the market would have subscribed the whole quantity issued, this obliged the Bank to make systematic interventions and prevented control of liquidity creation. The interbank market was anaemic and inefficient. Heads of Government and Treasury ministers listened to the Bank of Italy, but the Bank had very limited independence in using the instruments of monetary policy. The discount rate was fixed by the Treasury, albeit on the basis of a proposal from the Governor, and nearly every act of the Bank was formally subject to the Government’s oversight. The prerequisites for autonomy of the central bank comparable to that enjoyed by today’s European System of Central Banks were lacking.                                                       3  G.

The transition towards a “monetary constitution” In the summer of 1975, when Baffi succeeded Carli, the Italian economy had fallen into the deepest recession since the war, triggered by the oil shock and by the credit tightening that had been agreed with the International Monetary Fund in order to counter the imbalance in the external accounts, the upsurge of inflation and the depreciation of the lira. The shock hit Italy at the height of an expansionary cycle, at a time of extreme weakness of economic policy management. Wages, rising at annual rates of more than 20 per cent, had lost any link with productivity. The devaluation-inflation spiral seemed untamable, not least because of the perverse system of indexation. The Treasury’s deficits, pushed up by increases in public spending that were out of control, had exceeded values compatible with non-inflationary financing. The central bank, unheeded, watched from the sidelines. In the international arena, the prevailing view of the role of monetary policy was changing. The Bundesbank had been announcing money supply targets since 1974, and the Federal Reserve, under Paul Volcker, would adopt quantitative monetary targets in 1979. In the Concluding Remarks that he read on 31 May 1976, Baffi, recalling similar opinions of Einaudi and Carli at dramatic moments, observed that the severe limitations imposed by the institutional framework did not allow the Bank of Italy freedom of action. In times of financial imbalance and wage inflation, he stressed, “control of the money supply has to be abandoned in order to avoid, or at least postpone, worse evils”. However, Baffi did not give up pursuing the fundamental goal: moving Italy towards institutional arrangements in the field of monetary policy that would guarantee monetary stability over the longer run. This process would not actually get under way until the start of the 1980s, with the “divorce” between the Bank of Italy and the Treasury promoted by Treasury Minister Beniamino Andreatta and Governor Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. During the era in which he was governor, Baffi launched a “campaign of persuasion” directed at public opinion and the political forces. It was his conviction that monetary policy, in order to be successful, had to be backed by the consensus of all society on the objectives, including price stability. Italy was still far from such a situation. In Baffi’s view, what prevailed in determining the decisions regarding the public finances and wage trends was an alliance between different political and social groups that fuelled inflation. In the Governor’s view the first requirement for a reform of the monetary constitution was that the principle of safeguarding monetary stability become the linchpin of monetary policy. However, he considered that an insurmountable obstacle to this was the absence within the Italian legal framework of a provision, such as that in Germany, expressly entrusting the central bank with the task of defending the currency. A systematic search was made for arguments in support of assigning the Bank autonomous responsibility for fixing and pursuing monetary base objectives: during internal meetings the possibility was repeatedly raised of calling on the Government to enter into commitments to this effect or of using suggestions of similar import put forward by international institutions such as the European Economic Community or the International Monetary Fund. As one of Baffi’s leading collaborators has recalled, he invited the Bank’s legal experts to delve into every legal nook and cranny in search of the desired precept.5 The absence of a well-defined institutional framework made it necessary to adopt complicated logical exercises to argue in favour of the defence of the currency: for Baffi the principle of “no taxation without representation”, violated by inflation insofar as it causes arbitrary redistribution, was the one to call upon to give the central bank the task of defending the currency. In this “campaign of persuasion” Baffi frequently discussed monetary policy choices in the press. He believed that announcing monetary objectives was a factor of transparency that would have durably altered central banks’ modus operandi. As he was to say later, “the actions of central banks are no longer cloaked in silence, and perhaps never will be again. Whereas in the past silence was seen as a guarantee of independence, today this is achieved by giving an explicit account of one’s actions”.6                                                      5  M. Sarcinelli, “Governor Baffi’s monetary policy”, Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, Quarterly Review, no. 179, December 1991, pp. 513-35. 6  Banca d’Italia, Annual Report for 1978, p.158. BIS Review 31/2007 3 
Baffi was strongly opposed to the tangle of credit and foreign exchange administrative controls through which monetary policy was conducted. He found it profoundly unsatisfactory “in having to direct central bank action in such a way that it suffocates a system that possesses its own valid parameters and mechanisms; in having to constrain the volume of credit potentially expressed by the flow of monetary base because it is not possible to regulate that flow; in having to channel the flow of credit”. He was convinced that the costs of the distortions produced by administrative controls were substantial and lasting and that the monetary effects were ephemeral: in the long run the aggregates are brought “back into line with basic economic conditions”. Monetary management and the EMS negotiations Baffi did not win the battle against the straitjacket that had been imposed on the market. The emergencies he had to tackle, the exceptionally difficult situation he faced with regard to taxes and wages forced him to continue to use the administrative constraints put in place by his predecessor in earlier years. Monetary policy itself was constrained by the fact that price stability was not explicitly targeted and by his belief that there was no consensus on this in Italy. He was convinced that a monetary rule, however necessary and well formulated, could not replace discipline in the decisions and conduct of society as a whole and that it had to follow, and not precede, the adoption of such discipline. According to the expression used in the Concluding Remarks of the Annual Report for 1975, monetary management in those years was “coming to resemble an economy under siege”. At the beginning of 1976, after political, business, trade union and academic pressure had led to an easing of liquidity conditions, the low level of the official reserves and the opening of a Government crisis triggered a violent attack against the lira, the presages of which had been underestimated up to the end of the previous year, and led to the closing of the foreign exchange market for forty days. The turbulence on foreign exchange markets continued during the year with ups and downs and a succession of restrictive measures that included exchange and credit controls, the reintroduction of the ceiling on loans, an increase in compulsory reserves and rises in the discount rate for a total of nine points. These steps were effective in bringing the external balance back into equilibrium, replenishing the official reserves and repaying foreign loans. The exchange rate fell by about one third; inflation rose to 23 per cent and then slowed to about 12 per cent. Recourse to administrative credit and foreign exchange measures was not avoided. Contemporary documents confirm that Baffi was against using administrative controls but also show that he was convinced their use could not be ruled out given the influence exerted by the state of the market. Late in 1978, the dramatic year that saw the kidnapping and assassination of Aldo Moro and the killing of his escort, negotiations began for Italy’s membership of the European exchange rate mechanism. Not a few considered acceptance of the external constraint as providing powerful support in curbing the factors − rents, wages and public expenditure − that prevented Italy from definitively overcoming an emergency that had lasted too long not to threaten the stability of the country’s institutions. Baffi’s position was cautious: he recognized that belonging to the European Monetary System could help to bring down inflation, but he believed that this should be the result of agreement on domestic policies and that a start should be made before entering into the exchange rate commitment. During the negotiations Baffi advocated a system with a broad fluctuation band of 6 or 8 per cent about the central parity for all the participant countries. This idea was not disagreeable to the Bundesbank, which feared an inflexible exchange rate with partners marked by high inflation and low credibility. Baffi was well aware of the risks of a constraint associated with an exchange rate parity unrelated to the performance of the fundamentals of the economy. He feared that the results Italy had achieved in the three previous years in terms of replenishing the reserves and adjusting the current account of the balance of payments might be jeopardized by participation in a mechanism that would force the lira to appreciate in real terms, to the detriment of exports. Italy did join the EMS, but with a broader fluctuation band than that applying to the rest of the System members. The exchange rate constraint helped to damp down inflation in the first half of the 1980s. Its symbolic value was perceived by the political and social forces as a prerequisite to Italian participation in European integration, and the Bank of Italy was able to implement counter-inflationary monetary policy. Baffi’s caution with regard to the cogency of the exchange rate constraint may have proved excessive, perhaps, but only because System realignments were much more frequent than could have been predicted when the Exchange Rate Mechanism was agreed. At the same time, the availability of 4 BIS Review 31/2007 
the broad fluctuation band, which he had argued for, allowed a degree of freedom for monetary policy and thus limited the risk of the speculative attacks that typify fixed exchange rate regimes. In Baffi’s own words, the mechanism permitted “a soft transition, without the jumps, the discontinuities in market rates that trigger destabilizing speculation and often enable it to reap enormous profits”.7The legacy of Paolo Baffi This is not the proper place to recount the well-known judicial affairs that forced Paolo Baffi to resign as Governor on 20 September 1979, only to be totally exonerated from the charges two years later. As he later said, his incrimination obliged him to contend “for two years and more not with bad money but with a justice system that was even worse”. Quite apart from the machinations behind the scenes in his indictment, which had major repercussions on the Bank of Italy, it must be admitted that the institutional architecture of the day – the Director General’s responsibilities included banking supervision but he was also a member of the Board of Directors of IMI – was a weakness, which was later rectified. If the results achieved in the battle against inflation were only partial during Baffi’s governorship, the successes that came in the course of the 1980s and 1990s can be traced to the seeds he had sown with his commitment to a new monetary constitution. During his Governorship the question of separating the responsibilities of government and central bank was posed. The process subsequently set in motion produced first the abandonment and then the prohibition of monetary financing of the Treasury, the assignment to the Bank of Italy of the power to set the discount rate, formal recognition of its independence and, finally, its formal mandate, within the framework of the European System of Central Banks, to work for the objective of price stability. The full achievement of independence nevertheless took another fifteen years, major legislative reform and, lastly, an international treaty. In the 1980s and early 1990s, in a course of reform that was initiated and spurred in part by the Bank of Italy, broader and more efficient money and government securities markets were created. The effectiveness of indirect instruments of monetary control increased. Paolo Baffi as Governor is perhaps best symbolically portrayed as a ferryman of ideas, with all the exertion that such an image implies. His intellectual heritage was liberal, embracing more leavenings of modernity than were to be found in the political and economic culture of the day. But action was fettered by the harshness of the times. These were years, let us not forget, of bitter social conflict, years of terrorism. Paolo Baffi’s awareness of the drama of social problems was painfully acute, as is well known by those who were close to him in those years and could see the signs that a man of his temperament allowed to emerge. Subsequent developments in Italy and in Europe and the consequent advances in economic theory have confirmed that the effectiveness of monetary policy depends above all on appropriate institutional arrangements and on the ability to affect the expectations and the behaviour of the public; and that appropriate institutional arrangements, in turn, are not unrelated to political and social consensus. Institutions comprise the set of written and unwritten rules that guide the conduct of the central bank, formal recognition of its objectives and independence, and suitably designed instruments, ensuring effectiveness of action without interfering in the operation of a market economy. To us Paolo Baffi, who was the very antithesis of the politician, has bequeathed the conviction that the strength of economic policy springs from rigorous conduct and from the consensus it enjoys in the society within which it works its effects.                                                       7  P.

BIS Review 31/2007 1 Torben Nielsen: Financial stability, the Danish perspective Speech by Mr Torben Nielsen, Governor of Danmarks Nationalbank, arranged by the Bank of Finland, Ivalo, 23 March 2007. *      *      * Thank you for inviting me to talk about financial stability from a Danish perspective. Speech by Governor Torbenielsen I will start out giving an outline of the Danish financial system and the changing Nordic banking landscape. I will then talk about the role of Danmarks Nationalbank in safeguarding financial stability. Looking ahead, one of our priority areas is stress testing of the Danish financial system. Our ambition is to learn more about how the banks affect each other and the economy in stress situations. Finally, I will touch upon a topical issue, namely lending to households, household debt and house prices. The Danish financial system and the changing Nordic banking landscape The Danish banking sector is very heterogeneous and is dominated by two large banking groups, Danske Bank and Nordea, which covers more than 45 percent of the Danish banking market. There are a small number of medium-sized institutions, Jyske Bank, Sydbank, Nykredit Bank and FIH, with a total market share of almost 20 percent. And we have more than 150 small banks sharing the residual market share of 35 percent. 
2 BIS Review 31/2007  Compared to the other Nordic countries, the concentration ratio in Denmark – measured by the concentration ratio CR5 – does not stand out. However, the Nordic banking markets are amongst the most consolidated in Europe – similar to other smaller European economies. In larger countries like Germany and UK we find concentration ratios around 20 and 35 percent, respectively. The bulk of banking consolidation in the Nordic countries took place just before – in the case of Denmark – and shortly after the banking crises in Finland, Norway and Sweden in the early 1990s. We experienced a second wave around the turn of the century with the formation of Nordea as the most spectacular case. And the most recent event was Danske Banks purchase of Sampo Bank last autumn.    There is a significant presence of foreign banks in Denmark dominated by Nordea. Foreign banks and subsidiaries hold around 30 percent of total assets. Expansion of foreign banks in Denmark has typically not stemmed from organic growth via new branches or subsidiaries, but has instead been accomplished via mergers and acquisitions. 
BIS Review 31/2007 3 The presence of foreign banks in Denmark is comparable to Norway and Sweden. The Finnish situation is exceptional, since Nordea Bank Finland is counted as a Swedish subsidiary and Sampo Bank as a Danish subsidiary. With Danske Banks acquisition of Sampo Bank, the two biggest players in the Nordic-Baltic banking markets are Danske Bank and Nordea. Danske Bank is the largest in terms of lending and total assets, while Nordea is greater as regards equity and market value. The role of Danmarks Nationalbank in safeguarding financial stability Danmarks Nationalbank is monitoring and assessing financial stability in Denmark. The Danmarks Nationalbank Act from 1936 states that Danmarks Nationalbank shall ”maintain a safe and secure currency system in this country, and […] facilitate and regulate the traffic in money and the extension of credit”. The approach in Danmarks Nationalbank is to consider the general risks to the financial system rather than the risks to the individual financial institutions. The latter is the task of the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority.   At Danmarks Nationalbank we have defined financial stability to be a state that exits: "When the financial system is robust enough for any problems experienced within the sector not to spread and prevent the financial markets from functioning as providers of capital and financial services." And how do we actually solve our tasks in relation to financial stability? Firstly, we seek to analyse the key risks to the financial sector. This includes situations that are very unlikely to arise, but which could potentially involve high costs to society. We perform stress tests on the financial system in order to calculate how large an adverse impact the existing buffers are able to absorb. We have been publishing these analyses in our annual Financial Stability report since 2002. Denmark has now, for some years, been enjoying favourable economic conditions, which benefit the financial sector, and the Danish banking institutions show record-high earnings. Overall, the financial institutions in our latest financial stability report were found to be robust, and there still seems to be no black clouds in the horizon that could threaten financial stability in Denmark. Another task for Danmarks Nationalbank in relation to financial stability is to ensure that Denmark has a secure and effective financial infrastructure that can safely be used for settlement of payments, securities trading and other financial transactions. Danmarks Nationalbank now has a statutory obligation to oversee payment and settlement systems in Denmark. 
4 BIS Review 31/2007 Part of the IMF's Financial Sector Assessment Program of the Danish financial sector in 2005-06 was to assess the core elements of the Danish financial infrastructure in relation to international standards. The IMF recommended a few changes. Danmarks Nationalbank will work with those responsible for the systems to ensure that the necessary improvements are made. However, we will not blindly adhere to all recommendations.    For example, the IMF recommends that we establish a buffer pool to ensure the settlement of securities transactions and retail payments even if the largest participant is not able to settle its payment obligations. Danmarks Nationalbank finds that the best safeguard is to ensure that participants have easy and flexible access to liquidity, combined with participants' large portfolios of securities that can be pledged as collateral for loans from Danmarks Nationalbank. The figure shows the largest Danish banking institutions’ maximum net outgoing payments as a ratio of their liquidity reserves in 2005 where on each day the banking institution with the largest payment obligation is excluded from the settlement. The figure shows that Danish banks have plenty of liquidity reserves even when the largest bank fails to settle. Consequently, we do not currently see any need for special measures to ensure settlement in the Danish systems. A third area that we are looking at is situations where the financial system is affected by dramatic external events. These could be acts of terrorism, widespread epidemics, natural disasters or other situations where the financial system threatens to collapse. Danmarks Nationalbank chairs a task force with participation of the Financial Supervisory Authority and sector representatives that later this spring will present suggestions on how to ensure coordination of the financial institutions' business continuity plans in such situations. Finally, Danmarks Nationalbank acts as lender of last resort to the Danish banks. Danmarks Nationalbank can extend loans to a bank that urgently needs liquidity and cannot procure it in the market, even though the bank is solvent. Fortunately, we are rarely called on to do that. Should a situation occur where it is necessary to rescue an ailing bank, Danmarks Nationalbank's position is that a market-based solution should be found. Nothing definite can be said beforehand about Danmarks Nationalbank's role. It would depend on a concrete assessment of the situation and the – direct or indirect – consequences for the Danish banking system and Danish society.  
BIS Review 31/2007 5 Stress testing As I mentioned before, IMF visited Denmark in connection with its Financial Sector Assessment Program. The overall conclusion of the FSAP was that Denmark's financial systems are resilient and well supervised and that the financial sector shows a high degree of compliance with the international standards. Part of the FSAP was stress testing based on "bottom-up" and "top-down" approaches. For the bottom-up" approach, the largest banking institutions in Denmark were asked by the Danish FSA to estimate the effect of certain macroeconomic stress scenarios against the background of the institutions' own data and models. The results were compared to the "top-down" approach, prepared by the IMF and Danmarks Nationalbank, which focused on overall patterns in the banking sector's losses on loans and guarantees on the basis of model calculations. The next slide shows result of the "top-down" analyses performed by Danmarks Nationalbank.    Historically, a correlation can be observed between the development in unemployment, domestic lending as a ratio of GDP and the banking sector's losses on loans and guarantees. Danmarks Nationalbank has estimated a simple model which makes use of this correlation in the projection of the banking sector's total losses on loans and guarantees in given scenarios. The blue line represents the actual, historical losses to the banks, while the yellow line shows modeled calculations of the historical development. The broken lines show the expected development in the different stress scenarios. 3 stress scenarios with increasing severity were used. In the most severe scenario a slowdown in the domestic economy is exacerbated by a tightening of the ECB's monetary policy. This scenario implies a 30 per cent drop in housing prices in Denmark and a decrease in GDP by 3 per cent over three years. The result of the stress test is that the banking institutions' losses on loans and guarantees will rise by almost 1.5 percentage points over the 3 year period. This is somewhat lower than actual losses in the early 1990s where losses and provisions reached 2.5 percent on average.  
6 BIS Review 31/2007  Looking ahead we have decided to further develop our stress testing abilities at Danmarks Nationalbank. Our ambition is to learn more about how the banks affect each other and the economy in stress situations. The work on stress testing is still in its infancy. We are trying to define a stress testing architecture and in this process we are among other things taking a close look at developments in other central banks. SLIDE 9 shows our stress test architecture.    Lending to households, household debt and house prices The economic conditions of homeowners in Denmark are underpined by a strong housing market, and housing prices have accelerated in recent years. Lately, price increases have leveled off, c.f. SLIDE 10.  
BIS Review 31/2007 7  The recent rising house prices especially reflect improvement in the economic fundamentals. The Danish economy is growing strongly, interest rates remain low, unemployment is falling, and disposable incomes are increasing. At the same time, the introduction of new loan types, e.g. deferred-amortisation, has helped to sustain price increases. The freezing of property taxes has also affected prices. Lending growth is high in Denmark. SLIDE 11 shows the lending growth of big banks, medium sized banks and small banks. Growth in lending to households accounts for almost half of total lending growth, and 60 per cent of the household element stems from lending for home-financing purposes. On top of that we have seen lending growth of mortgage credit institutions to households of around 10 percent.   Danish households hold large gross debt compared to households in other countries. SLIDE 12 shows the debt as a ratio of GDP. Households in countries such as the Netherlands and the UK also have high levels of indebtedness.  
8 BIS Review 31/2007  The debt has increased during the last decade, but the development in the debt of Danish households does not differ significantly from other countries. The level of debt is thus high, but the development during the last 10 years is not extraordinary in a European context. The high gross debt ratio, combined with a shift to an extensive use of adjustable-rate mortgage-credit loans instead of fixed rate mortgages, makes the households more vulnerable to rising interest rates. We have calculated the households’ additional mortgage interest burden if interest rates rise (SLIDE 13). On average, mortgage interest expenses will increase by 1.2 percent of the house-hold’s gross income if interest rates rise by 1 percentage point, but there are considerable variations. Some households will be financially challenged if interest rates increase by a few percentage points. This could impose losses on banks and mortgage-credit institutes. Nevertheless, our overall assessment is that the development in homeowners’ exposure to rising interest rates does not threaten the functioning of the financial system – or financial stability. To put it bluntly, the failure of a number of households to meet their obligations to their credit institutions is not necessarily a financial stability problem.    
BIS Review 31/2007 9 The banking institutions have gained market shares from the mortgage-credit institutions by offering mortgage loans ("prioritetslån", loans collateralised by real estate). Often the excess liquid proceeds for the customer are placed in a deposit account subject to the same interest terms as the loan. Against this background, a proportion of the banking institutions' lending growth is reflected in increased deposits. The increase in lending has been stronger than the increase in deposits from the non-financial sector. This has eroded the traditional deposit surplus in Denmark, obliging the banks to resort to other sources of funding to make up for the difference, e.g. by issuing bonds and borrowing from other credit institutions, c.f. SLIDE 14.   We are in these weeks in the process of finalising the implementation of covered bonds legislation in Denmark according to the Capital Adequacy Directive. Previously, only mortgage-credit institutions have been allowed to issue mortgage credit bonds in Denmark. But as a consequence of the new legislation, this sole and exclusive right of mortgage credit institutions will be abolished and banks will be able to fund mortgage loans by issuing covered bonds (in Danish "særligt dækkede obligationer) on a level playing field with the mortgage credit institutions. The new legislation will introduce a new possibility for banks to fund their deposit deficit and possibly thereby benefit financial stability in Denmark. Covered bonds are expected to benefit competition between the banking institutions and the mortgage-credit institutions. Looking ahead, there is no reason to expect a downturn in the housing market in Denmark in view of the currently very strong Danish economy. In certain regions, downward price correction cannot be ruled out, however. For homeowners that purchased when prices peaked, a potential drop in prices would be a setback, but is hardly likely to threaten the economy or financial stability in Denmark. 
Ardian Fullani: Summary of the latest macroeconomic developments in Albania Address by Mr Ardian Fullani, Governor of the Bank of Albania, to the meeting “The banking system over 2007: the Governor communicates with the market”, Tirana, 26 March 2007. *      *      * Distinguished participants, Considering the today’s meeting of a special importance in line with our institutional tradition and intensive communication with the general public, particularly with the main market stakeholders, I would like to thank you for your participation. I think that such meetings further increase the degree of mutual understanding, aiming at enhancing the financial market efficiency.  Allow me to start my address, making a brief summary of the latest macroeconomic developments. Likewise in 2005, the Albanian economy, even during the last year, continued its path towards macroeconomic consolidation. The country’s GDP is estimated at 5 percent growth in real terms. This growth has been associated with price stability, denominated in an average annual inflation of 2.4 percent. The monetary conditions, characterised by historically low interest rates and a stable exchange rate, have favoured the rise of investments and consumption in the economy. Particularly, they have been reflected even in the rapid credit growth, further sustaining the economy growth.  The fiscal developments have resulted within the programmed levels, contributing to further consolidation of the public finances and to budget deficit control.  The extension of the country’s economic activity has been associated with increased foreign trade exchanges. The balance of payments for 2006 has recorded positive terms, sustaining the exchange rate stability.  From the BoA’s monetary policy viewpoint, I would like to underscore that year 2006 coincided with a change of the previous direction. Initially in July and later on in November 2006, the BoA’s Supervisory Council rose key interest rate by 0,25 pp, leading it to 5,5 percent, from 5 percent at end of June 2006.  The Bank of Albania decisions were a reflection of a number of risk factors, whose presence constituted a potential risk on the long-term inflation performance, which, I re-emphasise, from the legal viewpoint, constitutes our primary objective. The Bank of Albania is confident that its decisions were appropriate and they have served to orient inflationary expectations within the target range.  End-2006 and first quarter of 2007, as well as current inflation forecasts indicate that we have been successful in this direction. However, I avail myself of the opportunity to re-emphasise that we remain totally committed to successfully monitor the current developments and the implications they may entail in future development. Our focus will continue to be the control of inflationary pressures in the economy.  To this end, I would like to attract the banking system attention to a new project of the Bank of Albania, which is going to assist us a lot in this regard. Our researches, the business and consumer sentiments do not succeed in attaining appropriate dimension under the conditions of lacking the financial market expectations on inflation, exchange rate and key interest rate. In the near future, a new requirement will be made to the banking system, having to do precisely with what I previously said: Which is the bank’s expectation on inflation, exchange rate and repo rate in the short and long run. Personally, I consider it as a new challenge for the banking system; therefore I would insist that the whole banking system should deal seriously with this problem, to timely incorporate scientific analysis and research centres into its organisational structures.  I am confident that the banking system has already understood that, inter alia, it is just the time for such institutions to pay attention to developments of the economy, intensifying the analysis on current and future developments.  Another issue I will deal with in this address is the monetary policy decision-making perception and implementation. Given the current stage of financial market development in Albania, high level of euroization and other objective and subjective factors, I would say that the monetary transmission efficiency is not yet in the parameters of the developed financial markets. The currency market is still BIS Review 31/2007 1 
concentrated; its specific segments are characterised by insignificant trading volume and high volatility.  Effective liquidity management is an important element for us, which, as in other central bank, goes beyond a mechanic management of excess liquidity withdrawal or injection in case of shortage. By managing the liquidity, we have aimed at implementing the monetary policy decisions made by the Bank of Albania Supervisory Council to the market. Liquidity management intends controlling short-term interest rates, keeping them in line with monetary policy decisions. Concretely, the frequent use of other instruments, besides the main instrument of the Bank of Albania, reflects the Bank of Albania’s determination in terms of controlling short-term interest rates.  I would also like to point out that preventing or solving situations of liquidity shortage or excess are not sufficient for achieving the liquidity management goal by the central bank; the effective liquidity management should ensure its smooth re-allocation among banking system operators. As a result of liquidity concentration, this would reduce the short-term interest rate volatility.  In this framework, in 2007, the Bank of Albania will start the application of a new Regulation “On repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements” which will bring about a novelty on interventions for a more effective distribution of banking system liquidity.  This development of the regulatory framework will foster the repo market among commercial banks. It will contribute to the establishment of a more active inter-bank liquidity market and more active liquidity management by commercial banks. Not only the information but also the real time of its transmission is of unquestionable importance to the financial market. In this context, I would like to emphasize that though the central bank has the necessary statistics to estimate the banks’ positions and their operations, we expect from them to work more for enhancing the transparency in this regard.  To encourage banks in terms of enhancing the transparency, the Bank of Albania has provided to the system the Regulation “On calculating fixed interest in interbank currency market”, whose application shall be of importance not only to the Bank of Albania, but also to commercial banks for active liquidity management. In the same line, the central bank, through its active participation in the “Dealers Association” is supporting even the creation of a code of conduct for interbank relationships, which is deemed to lay another stone to market development in Albania.  As I mentioned above, the political decision-making of the Bank of Albania is forward-looking. From this viewpoint, I would require from the banking system to adopt the same philosophy: “React today to prevent undesirable events in the future! As Alain Blinder has stated: “Frequently the decision-makers only look through the window and make case decisions, based on current circumstances”. Therefore, the banking system should adopt the same philosophy for assimilating and factorising the Bank of Albania’s decisions into the short- and long-term operational strategy.  Another issue is an argument, which given the importance and the current stage of the economic-financial development of the country, assumes an extremely high importance. The financial stability has become a central topic of current practical-academic debate. I would like to bring to your memory the regional conference of the Bank of Albania organised in October of the last year related to this issue. While the debate continues for determining a number of qualitative and quantitative indicators to measure the vulnerability of the economy, I would like to attract your attention to a higher attention we jointly should pay in this direction.  The macroeconomic stability is of primary importance, but without doubt, even the financial stability is of the same vital importance. We should not forget that the segment represented in this audience constitutes the most developed and regulated part of the whole financial sector. The banking system in Albania has been transformed into a promoter of the country’s economic sustainability, by extending funds to the economy. At the same time, the variety of financial products it supplies is being increased year on year.  At end-2006, the banking system was presented in a good financial position. Its assets were to ALL 624.3 billion, or about 25.7 per cent more than in end-2005. The banking system deposits have amounted to ALL 520.3 billion, reaching 20.2 percent on annual basis. The loans portfolio is estimated at ALL 197 billion, 55 percent higher than year-end 2005. About 28 percent of the loans portfolio has been extended in ALL, while the rest in foreign currency. At end of 2006, the loans portfolio quality resulted to 3.05 percent. In December 2006, the capital adequacy ratio was 18.1 percent; while the banking system profit was ALL 7.45 billion. Return on assets was 1.36 percent, whereas return on equity was 20.2 percent. It is my pleasure to observe the increased number of branches and banking agencies and the ever increased geographic covering of the territory with banking services and 2 BIS Review 31/2007 
products. The entry into the market of distinguished European banks is another accomplishment of the last year, which is expected to continue even during the current year. Being driven by competition, banks have been more aggressive in lending, using new segments of the lending market, such as consumer credit or real estate loans.  In spite of what I mentioned earlier, it does not mean that we are automatically immunized against various risks, which may occur from one moment to the other. Furthermore, the rapid credit growth is an argument for more prudence, particularly in terms of its quality. Being completely aware for our role as a decision-making and regulatory institution, we have decided to raise our vigilance in this direction. We will create a specialised unit, i.e., the Financial Stability Department, as a first step.  The safeguarding of the banking and financial system stability will be given a new dimension relating to the policy of licensing the conduct of banking business by the Bank of Albania. Once more, the Bank of Albania emphasizes its objective related to licensing and the presence of sound institutions in the banking system: which are backed by influential and experienced shareholders in the banking industry; which apply the best standards of accountability in management; which conduct a balanced business with well-administered risks; which are able to cope with and develop under the competition provided in an open and integrated market into the international financial market; which boost the country’s economic development and which, transparently provide to the public qualitative and efficient banking products and services.  The Bank of Albania is confident that only financially stable banking institutions guarantee the foundations of a financial market, which develops dynamically and which is able to avoid systemic financial crises. Therefore, the Bank of Albania sustains and encourages the process of transformation and consolidation of the activity of banking institutions. They naturally come to help the banking institutions which are faced with difficulties during their own activity and others which intend to expand the business through a more effective use of ample financial sources.  In this framework, the Bank of Albania, based on the new banking system law, cooperating with other financial market authorities, will work for enriching and stratifying this market with efficient financial institutions specialised in financial activities, which sustain the banking activity and ensure a better covering of the population needs with financial services.  Regardless of the above, I think that the system should be more committed to this direction. Banks, particularly those that are more active and of systemic importance, should set up and strengthen their risk management structures, mainly in terms of market risks (interest rate and exchange rate), credit risk and operational risk. This implies not only the ensuring of human capacities, but also the establishment of necessary systems of information and technology. This process should not be considered as a cost-advantage relationship in material level and in the short run, but as an indispensable process, which hedges the bank from risks, which, under certain market conditions, may be intensified, resulting to fatal circumstances.  While the supervisory attention is focused particularly on large banks that are of systemic importance, the same importance is assigned even to small banks, which are faced intensively with the consequences brought about by enhancement of market competition. In view of this, the Bank of Albania requires from the management of these banks to act quickly for protecting their business. The necessary operations should intend the qualitative improvement of banking services to the public, development of joint projects with larger banks and with other financial institutions inside the country and abroad, establishment of a more suitable work environment and provision of necessary promotions to their staff. In the meantime, their boards of directors and shareholders of these banks should strengthen the monitoring and should be ready for a larger financial support for the bank’s activity.  In particular, I would like banks to be cautious with regard to: • The continuous monitoring and controlled conduct of lending activity, focusing on setting realistic development objectives, on the exposure to related persons, exposure to foreign currency – in particular, to borrowers with insufficient financial assets in foreign currency, exposure to new loan products, such as consumer loan, etc. It is crucial for banks to rigorously observe the lending and loans’ quality analysis procedures. Moreover, they should maintain a conservatory stand, in terms of being insured with pledges and collaterals, and of providing for reserve funds, required in cases of non-performing credit risk. In this context, the Bank of Albania expects commercial banks to duly observe the final amendments made to the regulation “On managing credit risk”.  BIS Review 31/2007 3 
• The consolidation of internal control systems of their activity, in view of the adoption of best accounting standards in management, as well as the careful formulation and analysis of financial statements by the banks’ structures and their internal and external auditing. With regard to the latter, we are under the process of enhancing the reporting system, by shortening the reporting time of the financial data, periodically reported by banks to the Bank of Albania. We think that banks should qualitatively improve the method of preparing and reporting these data to the Bank of Albania. These issues will be the topic of discussion in a special meeting to be held in the near future. From the legal viewpoint, the issues related to the conduct of a safe banking business have been addressed at a higher level, in the new law “On banks in the Republic of Albania”, passed by the Albanian Parliament on 18 December 2006, and becomes effective on 1 June 2007. Some of its important amendments are the following: a more complete addressing of banking business supervision issues, including the organization, the risk monitoring, the provision of prudential supervision norms, the clarification of procedures related to the management and liquidation, the inclusion of some general principles related to the client’s protection (consumer of banking products) etc. Following the notification sent by the Bank of Albania on January this year, the banks should speed up the steps to duly and timely carry out the necessary changes in their internal procedures, which ensure the complete consistency of their business with the requirements of the new law. I take this opportunity to draw your attention in terms of applying the legal requirement for the observance of international financial reporting standards, starting from 2008. This is an issue banks belonging to European Union banking groups are more prepared for. However, these banks, and in particular other banks not availing of this opportunity, should co-operate with external auditing companies, in order to define the concrete measures to be taken in their activity for the observance of this legal requirement. Dear participants,  I believe today’s meeting is a good opportunity to communicate with one-another; therefore, I invite you to keep on exchanging effective ideas and thoughts. On behalf of the institution I represent, I would like to reassure you that the Bank of Albania remains fully committed and accountable in fulfilling its legal mission, capable and willing to loyally co-operate with any institution or stakeholder influencing on the country’s economic and financial development Thank you. 4 BIS Review 31/2007 
Ernesto Gouveia Gove: Central Bank of Mozambique’s review of 2006 and prospects for 2007 Speech by Mr Ernesto Gouveia Gove, Governor of the Bank of Mozambique, on the occasion of the 2006 Financial Year Closing Ceremony, Maputo, 20 December 2006. *      *      * Distinct Members of the Board of Directors of the Banco de Moçambique Distinct Presidents and Representatives of Commercial Banks and Financial Institutions Dear Guests Ladies and Gentlemen, First of all, I would like to thank you, on behalf of the Board of Directors of the Banco de Moçambique and personally, for your presence in this traditional meeting of the end of the year in which we make the first analysis of the financial year ending and present our perspectives for the 2007 financial and economic year. Introduction The year 2006 was marked by important events for the country and our institution. The agreement on the reversion of Cahora Bassa Hydroelectric (HCB) plant to the Mozambican Government was indeed an event with an historic and economic dimension. Under this agreement, the Mozambican Government became the holder of 85% of the shares of that important undertaking, which empowers the government greater autonomy to make use of the HCB immense potential for social and economic development of the country as well as the whole SADC region. We congratulate our Government for this important victory and hope that Cahora Bassa becomes, more and more, a strong instrument of promotion of national interests and implementation of the national strategy of internal development and in the context of Southern African region. In 2006, the IMF Board, World Bank and African Development Bank, decided to include Mozambique in the list of poor countries, which benefited of debt relief, in the context of Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative, widely known as MDRI. For our country, this decision meant a write-off of about USD 2 billion in the stock of external debt, being USD 1.3 billion from the World Bank, 540 million from the African Development Bank and 154 million from the IMF. This gesture encourages us and confirms the commitment of the international community in relation to the performance of the Government in the implementation of PARPA (Plan of Action for the Reduction of Absolute Poverty) and macroeconomic stability and development programs. With this forgiveness, the ratios of Mozambique external position become greatly improved, allowing the Government to resort to external financing, on the basis of a criteria based management indebtedness, to pursue the multiple purposes of its development program and fight against absolute poverty. The international recognition of the Government positive performance was once more expressed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) when on December 18th, 2006, approved the PRGF program (Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility) that Mozambique has with that multilateral financial institution, a fact that offers good perspectives for the consolidation of international cooperation. It is worth referring to the changes that took place at the top management level of our institution during the present year. On this occasion, I would like, once again, to express our tribute to Dr. Adriano Maleiane who until mid of the present year was the Governor of the Banco de Moçambique. This recognition is extended to the colleagues of the Board of Directors who have also retired. They left a legacy of unselfish work in favour of our institution and the Mozambican financial system that we are all invited to preserve and to deepen. We would also like to praise the Associação Moçambicana de Bancos (Mozambican Association of Banks) for, most recently, having achieved a consensus in relation to a code of conduct for all its members. BIS Review 30/2007 1 
Main goals for 2006 At the end of the last year, when we met in this same venue, we announced that our performance in 2006 aimed at contributing to the success of the Government’s agenda, established in the Economic and Social Plan and Government Budget, documents that pointed out to 7.9% economic growth, 9.5% average inflation and an external position measured by gross international reserves equivalent to four months of imports of goods and non-factorial services. Our intermediary objectives pointed out to 14.5% money supply and a growth of the credit to the economy in line with the GDP nominal growth. At that moment, we explained that our agenda for 2006 would basically comprise multi-faced actions aimed at implementing the Law nº 7/2005, which defines the Conversion Rate of the Metical of the New Family. Performance of the monetary and foreign exchange policy Ladies and Gentlemen We began the year 2006 in an adverse international environment, due to the oil price volatility, which in the present year reached a new historic record of about USD 78/barrel. Fortunately, the signs reported this part towards the end of the year give us a certain optimism. Preliminary information, based on data of the first semester of 2006, pointed out that the Mozambican economy may experiment a real growth around 7.9%. Moreover, differently from the last years, GDP growth was influenced by the construction, mining, transports and communication, and cattle-raising activity sectors, which revealed themselves to be more dynamic and with greater relative contribution than the major projects. That is really positive for our growth sustainability, as it results from the activity of small and medium enterprises, which greatly absorb resources and local labour force and, which has greater impact on the process of the fight against absolute poverty and reflect the diversification of the productive activity in the country. As we know, the main mission of our institution is to ensure price stability. The evaluation we make is that inflation recorded a stable behaviour in 2006, compared with the year 2005, even taking into account that it was characterized by three different moments. Until April, we observed a rising trend of prices, period in which the annual variation rate peaked to 17%. Between May and August inflation slowed down, having the monthly variations been successively negative, prompting the annual rate to decline to 10%, the lowest level observed in the whole year. Seasonally, at the end of the year, inflation tends to rise. However, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) monthly variation in November differs from that of the similar period of 2005, which makes it possible to record one-digit cumulative inflation at the end of 2006, even if in terms of average rate, we stand slightly above the projections of the beginning of the year. The main instrument of monetary policy we use to restrain and maintain inflation under control were the Interbank Money Market operations supported by a strong vigilance over the requirement of compulsory reserve, which stand at 11.51% and by the rise of our intervention interest rate announced at the end of the first semester. The oil price rise in the international market had a considerable impact on fuel and related products domestic prices. This factor influenced the inflation, but the combination of policies by different macroeconomic management institutions and the performance of real sector of the economy have allowed to soften this shock. In 2006, the National Institute of Statistics (INE) introduced a new CPI basket, changing the year-base for 2004 and adjusting the weighing factors of several products comprising the basket. We congratulate the INE for this effort that reinforces the comparability of our statistics with those of other SADC countries, thus contributing to a greater integration of our economies. After a year of clear disturbances, in 2006, the Metical revealed to be well more stable against the main currencies traded in various segments of the foreign exchange market. The exceptional measures announced late 2005 revealed to be important to abate the market and endow it with greater discipline and professionalism. We would like to praise the results obtained with the adjustments undertaken in the whole chain of the complex process of fuel imports, in order to stabilize the exchange rate. The Metical depreciation in relation to the USD in 2006 was less than 10%, against 27% recorded in 2005; in relation to the Rand, our currency inverted the loss of 11% recorded last year, as it appreciated by about 3.3%. 2 BIS Review 30/2007 
The Banco de Moçambique continued to be the main supporter of the Interbank Foreign Exchange Market (IFEM), in terms of foreign currency sales, having to date allocated a total of USD 435 million net, in auctions and bilateral sales, against 393 million recorded in 2005. The foreign exchange market witnessed an increased confidence among its operators and this is proved by the increased volume and frequency of foreign exchange transactions among commercial banks, which peaked to 181.4 million in 2006, against 39.5 million in 2005. External sector developments (BoP) Ladies and Gentlemen According to information reported to September 2006, our Balance of Payments shows encouraging results. However, it still depends significantly on external support, making us more exposed to exogenous shocks, whose macroeconomic impacts are not always easy to predict. Our Country is totally dependent on imports of liquid fuels. The rise of Brent price in the international market results prejudicial in the behaviour of domestic inflation and international reserves. The fuel bill until September 2006 had amounted to about USD 300 million, against 218 million recorded in 2005. This figure worries us, taking into account that our exports, excluding the mega projects effect, are of only USD 600 million, in other words, about a half of the country export revenues are set to finance fuel bill. Until September 2006, Mozambique current account deficit had improved 38% compared with the similar period of 2005, if we include mega projects, and 9% excluding the operations of such projects. In the overall, we continue to import more than we export, having the amount of imports risen 23% in the first nine months of the current year, amounting to about USD 2 billion, whereas that of total exports amounted to USD 1.750 million. Thanks to a relatively more dynamic growth of goods export than that of imports, the imports coverage rate by exports improved again, representing 89.4% in September 2006, including mega projects (10 percentage points rise in comparison with the similar period of 2005), or 32.9%, when excluding mega projects. Even though, this level may be considered low, requiring additional efforts in order to promote greater diversification of exports, which must be done via increased production aimed at replacing imports, a condition to reduce the strong external dependence of our economy. In turn, the coverage ratio of imports of goods and nonfactorial services by gross international reserves stood at 4.7 months in November, above the four programmed months, including the mega projects. Ladies and Gentlemen One of our objectives is to foster a sound, strong and competitive financial system. In the period under analysis, we improved the evaluation instruments of the risk of financial sector through CAMEL methodology – Capital, Asset Quality, Management Quality, Earnings and Liquidity. Financial system and banking supervision Available data showed that, in the overall, our institutions are more sound and robust today, with the main indicators evolving positively and with more encouraging perspectives. The level of capitalization of the institutions continues to grow, standing at a position that can be considered satisfactory. The improvement of the soundness of financial system indicators reflects a combined effort of the Central Bank through the banking supervision and that of the credit institutions in strengthening their internal management and control processes. We can assert that today our system is more prepared to face several risks that the financial activity brings about. In effect, the ratio of non-performing loan reduced to 3.6%, while the solvency ratio grew to 16.7%, against the minimum of 8% required, according to the Basel I Convention terms or 12% under Basel II terms. BIS Review 30/2007 3 
Metical of the New Family Simultaneously, we continued to undertake efforts aiming at modernizing our payment systems. The process of implementation of the Law Nº 7/2005, regarding the introduction of the notes and coins of the Metical of the New Family began on July 1st, 2006, contributed to the fulfillment of this objective. We launched a broad advertising and civic education campaign addressed to resident citizens and our expatriates, about the details of this process. We praise the involvement of everyone, credit institutions, the local authorities, community leaders and the media, in the campaign of the Metical of the New Family, process running calmly, with no disturbances, having the notes and coins of the Metical of the New Family been accepted widely. We are grateful for having achieved, until now, a rate of substitution of the notes and coins of the former families of the Metical by that of the New Family above 85%, expecting it to stand above 90% by the end of the year, which is a really satisfactory level for our conditions. We would like to remind all the citizens that as from January 1st, 2007, the notes and coins of the former families of the Metical will no longer have a legal tender for any payment, otherwise they should be deposited or exchanged at any banking institution. Therefore, I would like, once again, to invite everyone to change the former families of the Metical by that of the new family through the commercial, banking and financial services existing in the country. Such as established in the Law, during 2007 the currency exchange should be done at the commercial banks, but even so, the people who by serious reasons are unable to change their money during this period, they will have the opportunity to do it at the Banco de Moçambique until 2012. Moreover, we would like to stress that as also prescribed in the Law, December 31st, 2006, marks the end of the use of the register designation “MTn” and the return to the designation “MT”, as well as the end of the mandatory double indication of prices in force since March 31st, 2006. Territorial expansion (branches) Ladies and Gentlemen, The strategy defined by the Government setting districts as the poles of planning and development of our economy, brings increased challenges to the financial sector. We are expected to give our contribution towards this objective, expanding our services throughout the national territory, especially to the less favoured areas but with enormous wealth and business potential. The financial sector should be sensible to the current low saving indices that the country records, which require pragmatic initiatives to encourage saving habits on our population. The increased demand of credit to finance public and private investment projects requires more dynamism in financial savings. On December 15th, 2006, we inaugurated the first branch of the Banco de Moçambique, in Quelimane city and within a few days we are going to Maxixe with a similar purpose. In the coming months we are going to open Tete, Pemba and Lichinga branches. This decision opens a new era in the activity of the Mozambican financial system and within our performance philosophy, as the issuing and supervisory bank of the financial and non-financial institutions. With this measure, we showed a great sign to the banking system on the urgent need to do our best in order to enlarge the financial services and decentralisation of banks throughout the country. The branches of the Banco de Moçambique will enable our mission in terms of issuance and circulation of notes and coins of good quality, modernization of the national payment systems, reduction of storing costs and transport of notes and coins by commercial banks, enable the Government financial operations, in the context of the Treasury single account and more decentralized financial administration, as well as everything related with licensing, support and supervision of micro-finance institutions. Our branches are being open in a decisive stage of the process of introduction of the Metical of the New Family. We were pleased to note that in 2006 some credit institutions expanded their branch network and financial services throughout the country, which we encourage recognizing its importance in fostering savings. Together with the Ministry of Finance we will continue to devise strategies and measures aimed at minimizing constraints that today are pointed out by the national banking system as impeditive of a 4 BIS Review 30/2007 
greater territory expansion and extension of financial services outside the main cities. The presence of banks in districts is going to foster the necessary savings for investments that the country really needs in order to face the millennium challenges, related to the fight against poverty. Ladies and Gentlemen, The Parliament has just analysed the Economic and Social Plan of the Government and the Budget for 2007, two important instruments of economic policy. In those instruments the Government envisages 7% real growth and 8% annual average inflation. For such purpose, our intermediate objectives will be set for 17.5% money supply, measured by the variation of stocks of the greater monetary aggregate (M3) and an expansion of Reserve Money, our instrumental variable, not above 14.5%. In 2007, we will continue to deepen the reforms underway in the interbank monetary and foreign exchange markets, the main instruments of execution of our monetary policy. Once set the foreign exchange market stability, we assume to have the conditions created for a gradual removal of the transitional measures introduced in November 2005. We have just approved a new regulation of the Interbank Foreign Exchange Market (IFEM). This normative instrument introduces procedures that were object of a long process of negotiation with commercial banks, namely: (i) inclusion of an adhesion requirement and obligation to quote firm to a reference amount of USD 50.000 (fifty thousand American Dollars), to a maximum of one call per day; (ii) enlargement of the spread between bit and offer rates, from the current 10 Ctn (ten cents) to 20 CTn (twenty cents); (iii) definition with greater detail of the bilateral operations with the Central Bank; (iv) enlargement of the variation maximum limit of the daily rate to 1%, which appears reasonable for greater flexibility of the IFEM operators in the whole business environment, where the foreign exchange stability continues to be our major interest. In order to offer greater credibility and transparency to the management of monetary policy, as well as to conform to the international good practices on the matter, after a long process of preparation, which included, among other aspects, the design of forecasting models and support monetary analysis to decision making, our committee on monetary policy is going to change its format and content, as from next year. The model we are going to adopt will address special attention to communication with the public, with the purpose of disseminating the nature of measures that the Central Bank takes, throughout the market and the whole society, signalling more clearly the monetary policy pursued in the present and future, which will certainly help the process of formation of economic agents expectations. The year 2007 is decisive for the implementation of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), thus marking the end of a transition process began in 2004. For such purpose, the banking supervision is going to address a future risk approach, conforming with the international practices on the matter. As from February 2007, the Banco de Moçambique will start performing the clearance of visa network credit cards issued by national banks, with the purpose of ensuring that (i) all domestic transactions performed in Meticais using cards issued by national banks, members of Visa are settled in Meticais, (ii) the role of the Metical as national currency is reinforced, (iii) the foreign exchange risk is reduced, (iv) transactions performed with Visa payment cards are accompanied and recorded; (v) the absence of a single payment network is partially fulfilled, and (vi) the ATMs (Automated Teller Machines) and EFT/POS (Point of Sale) services are enlarged. At the regional level, we will continue to give our contribution so that the objectives of macroeconomic convergence and integration defined by the SADC (Southern African Development Community) are achieved, particularly with respect to inflation, harmonization of procedures and legal framework that governs the central banks of the region. Within the African continent, as a member of the Association of African Central Banks (AACB), we will continue to contribute to the objective of the creation of a central bank of the continent. BIS Review 30/2007 5 
Final remarks Ladies and Gentlemen, We would like to express our profound recognition of the valuable contribution that all national economic agents, the society in general and the international community has been giving us in order to fulfil our mission, particularly in respect of the formulation and execution of a monetary policy in conformity with the objectives of economic growth, with low inflation. Allow me to address special thanks to the employees of the national financial system and in particular, to the collaborators of the Banco de Moçambique, for their devotion and commitment demonstrated during the year. I finish wishing you all and your distinct families, Merry Christmas and a prosperous New Year. Thank you very much. 6 BIS Review 30/2007 
Victor Mbewe: Positive financial and economic developments in Malawi Speech by Mr Victor Mbewe, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Malawi, at the Sovereign Credit Rating Dissemination Conference, Lilongwe, 16 March 2007. *      *      * The Minister of Finance, Hon. Goodall Gondwe, M.P.  The Minister of Trade, Industry and Private Sector Development, Hon. Ken Lipenga, M.P.  His Excellency, the US Ambassador to Malawi, Mr Alan Eastham  Members of the Diplomatic Corp  Heads of Missions (Development Partners)  Members of Parliament  The Chief Secretary to the President and Cabinet  Secretary to the Treasury  Principal Secretaries  Heads of Parastatal Organisations  Heads of Private Sector Industries  Mr Charles Seville and Veronica Kalema from Fitch Rating Agency  Representatives of the Civil Society  Distinguished Invited Guests  Representatives of Electronic and Print Media  Ladies and Gentlemen  I feel greatly honoured and happy to stand here today at this very important dissemination conference where Malawi has attained yet another economic development milestone indicating an improvement in the country’s creditworthiness. Credit rating is one of the areas where Malawi was considered lagging behind under the Millennium Challenge Account.  Honourable Minister, distinguished ladies and gentlemen, since the last credit rating in December 2005, where Malawi was rated at CCC, a lot of progress has been made and it was therefore imperative that a fresh rating exercise be conducted to determine our current status. To this effect, Fitch Rating Agency was engaged by Millennium Challenge Corporation to conduct the rating between 4th and 8th December 2006. Reserve Bank of Malawi as an implementing agency for Credit Rating for the country, successfully coordinated this exercise.  To begin with, it is worthwhile to mention that credit rating is an indication of the ability and willingness of a country to pay its external debt on the original terms. With a sovereign credit rating, the country is signalling to the rest of the world especially international investors its readiness to participate in the global economy by opening itself for public scrutiny and foster transparency in the collection and dissemination of information. A credit rating also helps to promote realistic monetary and fiscal policies and adherence to liberalization policies and reform efforts in keeping up with peer group countries and the global economy. Furthermore, the business world uses a sovereign credit rating as the benchmark to evaluate current and potential risks in a nation's economic environment they desire to invest in.  As alluded to earlier, many positive developments have taken place in Malawi since the last rating in 2005. Among these are cancellation of Malawi’s debt by both multilateral and bilateral creditors, the decrease in inflation rate and a reduction in interest rates.  The IMF and World Bank Boards on 30th and 31st August 2006, respectively, approved that Malawi had reached the HIPC Completion Point after making satisfactory progress in implementing its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) for at least one year, and maintained satisfactory macroeconomic policies as evidenced by its performance under the PRGF. Furthermore, Malawi also met all the completion point targets in the area of economic governance and public expenditure management, safety nets, and microfinance.  Apart from receiving HIPC debt relief, Malawi also qualified for the Multilateral Debt relief Initiative (MDRI) which cancelled all pre-2004 debt to the World Bank and African Development Bank, and pre-2003 debt to the IMF. In October 2006, Paris Club creditors also agreed to cancel almost 100% of Malawi’s debt owed to them.  BIS Review 30/2007 1 
These developments, distinguished ladies and gentlemen, reduced Malawi’s external debt from 142% of GDP at the end of 2005 to 23% of GDP at the end of 2006. Other external debt indicators also improved significantly.  Distinguished ladies and gentlemen, let me now turn to the monetary policy stance that was pursued in 2006. Monetary developments in 2006 were generally expansionary. The increase in money supply mainly arose from net foreign reserves on account of receipts for balance of payments support. The increase in money stock was also partly a reflection of an expansion in credit to the private sector. It should be noted that since March 2006, credit to the private sector has been increasing steadily, implying that the February 2006 reduction in the Liquidity Reserve Requirement (LRR) was bearing fruit. This is in line with the economic program which allows for more credit to the private sector to boost economic growth. The Bank Rate was adjusted downwards from 25.0 percent to 20.0 percent on 13th November 2006. As a result, commercial banks followed suit by adjusting both their savings and deposit rates. The reduction in interest rates should, therefore, give an opportunity to the private sector to participate in borrowing capital, thereby generating economic growth.  It is also pleasing to note that the rate of inflation has been declining since February 2006. By December 2006, the annual rate of inflation declined to 13.6 % from 17.1% realised in 2005.  This was mainly due to:  • slowdown in food inflation as a result of a good crop.  • relative stability of the Malawi kwacha against other major currencies.  • lagged effects of a decline in money supply observed earlier in the year.  On the external sector, it is pleasing to note that foreign exchange reserves have been building up rapidly since the attainment of the HIPC Completion Point in August 2006. Between September 2006 and January 2007, the country has been benefiting from inflows from various donor partners, including the IMF, the British & Norwegian Governments, the European Union and DFID because of good performance. As a result of these inflows, the country’s gross official reserves improved significantly.  Prospects for 2007  Let me now give you a picture of our expected outcome for 2007. GDP growth in 2007 is projected to grow by 5.6%, a slower growth from 8.5% in 2006. The agricultural sector is expected to continue leading this growth due to the on-going fertilizer subsidy program coupled with the current favourable rains.  By December 2006, inflation rate had decelerated to 10.1 percent. In January 2007, the rate of inflation dropped to a single digit of 9.6 percent and it is expected that it would continue dropping further. This is mainly premised on the high food supply situation in the country (especially maize), that is expected to have a restraining effect on food inflation, which normally accelerates during this time of the year. The favourable outlook for inflation is based on the continued stability in food prices, the stable kwacha exchange rate and the easing of pressures on international oil prices.  In 2007, growth in money supply will be closely monitored to safeguard and consolidate the declining rate of inflation and the overall financial system stability.  The stability of the local currency will continue to depend on the flow of foreign exchange from the tobacco auction floors and the donor community, prices of petroleum products, as well as government’s fiscal discipline.  Distinguished ladies and gentlemen, this favourable outlook which I have outlined would assist the country to attain a higher rating at the end of 2007 compared to that of 2006.  The improvement in credit rating being officially announced today will assist in enhancing pricing and access to international capital markets. This would in turn enhance the inflows of private capital and hence increased investment. The goodwill that we have built with the international community will be further strengthened and this will ultimately signal that Malawi is a better place for doing business.  In conclusion, distinguished ladies and gentlemen, I would like to acknowledge the collective efforts played by all stakeholders for the success of the credit rating exercise. These include the Minister of Finance, Members of Parliament, Government officials, members of the private sector, the donor community and Non-Governmental Organisations. These officials spared their time to grant interviews 2 BIS Review 30/2007 
to Fitch Rating Agency. Let me also applaud my staff at RBM for compiling quality data used by Fitch in the rating exercise, some of which was supplied by National Statistical Office and Ministry of Finance.  Finally, let me thank Casals and Associates through the Millenuim Challenge Corporation, for their financial as well as logistical support they have provided to make this Conference a success.  Thank you for your attention and God bless you. BIS Review 30/2007 3 
Zeti Akhtar Aziz: Fostering linkages in Islamic finance Opening remarks by Dr Zeti Akhtar Aziz, Governor of the Central Bank of Malaysia, at the Global Islamic Finance Forum 2007: "Fostering Linkages in Islamic Finance", Kuala Lumpur, 27 March 2007. *      *      * Bismillahir Rahmanir Rahim Yang Amat Berhormat Dato' Seri Abdullah Badawi, Honourable Prime Minister of Malaysia Your Excellencies, Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, It is my very great pleasure and honour to welcome you to this Global Islamic Finance Forum (GIFF) 2007, hosted by Bank Negara Malaysia in conjunction with the Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB) Annual Meetings and Seminars. Allow me to first express my gratitude to the Honourable Prime Minister of Malaysia, Yang Amat Berhormat Dato' Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, for graciously accepting to be with us this afternoon to deliver the keynote address and to officiate this important forum.  The significant gathering at this forum, with the theme fostering Greater Linkages in Islamic Finance', is a manifestation of the increasing interest towards evolving the international dimension of Islamic finance. Indeed, building stronger alliances and greater intermediation inter-linkages forms part of the endeavor to facilitate greater international trade and investment flows.  The Islamic financial system, comprising the financial institutions, the markets and the financial infrastructure, has demonstrated its viability and robustness as a form of financial intermediation. Its growing role in mobilising and channeling the funds to productive investment activities across borders brings two significant benefits to the global economy. Firstly, it enhances the potential for higher global growth, while also contributing towards some rebalancing of the global growth. Secondly, the strengthened international financial linkages allows for greater potential for the diversification of risks. The increase in the Islamic financial products, the growing number of assets classes being offered, the increased cross ownership of assets all have expanded the possibilities for greater diversification of risks and the potential for return.  Today, Islamic finance represents a multi-billion dollar industry which has a presence in many countries and more recently, there has been widening participation by established financial centres. There are now more than 200 Islamic financial institutions, some of which are global players, offering an extensive range of Shariah compliant products and services to a broad spectrum of consumers and businesses that transcends beyond the Muslim world.  This global forum has aimed to bring together the industry practitioners, issuers and investors, the regulators, scholars as well as those in related services, including the IT services, legal, accounting and auditing professionals and those in human resource development. It is our hope that the deliberations today will play a catalytic role in building greater collective efforts through multi-stakeholder dialogues and network-building activities whilst discovering opportunities and also improving our understanding on important areas in Islamic finance.  Ladies and Gentlemen, As we know today, there are already clusters of cross-border collaborative activities taking place on several fronts that serve to contribute towards increasing the international integration process of Islamic finance. These activities have taken many forms ranging from equity and non-equity business collaboration, regulatory cooperation in setting the global development blueprint, information exchange and building consensus on issues for international prudential standards development, to inter-governmental memorandums of understanding for collaborative developmental initiatives in Islamic finance, and many others. BIS Review 30/2007 1 
Ladies and Gentlemen, As Islamic finance continues to make significant inroads in the international financial markets with expanding scale, growing magnitude and greater sophistication, a critical need emerges for an expanded discourse on the developments and emerging issues with its global relevance and impact, of interest to all its major stakeholders. This is the first time that Bank Negara Malaysia has organized a full-scale, multi-disciplinary, international event of this nature on Islamic finance. These sessions include the annual Investors & Issuers Forum, and Financial Regulators Forum and the biannual Banking and Financial Law School. It is our hope that participants will benefit from any of the parallel sessions of their interests and have increased opportunities for network building among the widening groups of stakeholders participation in the Forum. These forums have been designed to provide dynamic and interactive formats to encouraging open and inclusive dialogues that foster a greater collective understanding in Islamic finance. Let me record our appreciation to the many distinguished speakers from various international institutions, financial practitioners, legal fraternity, regulatory bodies and other prominent thought leaders in Islamic finance. It is our sincere hope that this global forum will be rewarding and may the collective wisdom derived from the deliberations lead to more collective actions that will be to our increased mutual benefits.  Let me once again express our appreciation to Yang Amat Berhormat Dato' Seri Abdullah Badawi for his presence here this afternoon and for accepting to deliver the keynote address at our Forum today.  Thank you. 2 BIS Review 30/2007 
Anselmo L S Teng: Overview of recent financial and economic developments in Macao Speech by Mr Anselmo L S Teng, Chairman of the Monetary Authority of Macao, at the Spring Cocktail Reception, Macao, 15 March 2007. *      *      * The Honorable Secretary for Economy and Finance, Mr. Francis Tam; The Honorable Director of the Economic Affairs Department of the Liaison Office of the Central People’s Government in the MSAR, Mr. Zhou Zhikui; The Honorable Chairman of the Audit Committee of AMCM, Mr. Leonel Alberto Alves; The Honorable Chairman of the Macau Association of Banks, Mr. Ye Yixin; The Honorable President of the Macau Insurers’ Association, Mr. Si Chi Hok; The Honorable President of the Macau Insurance Agents and Brokers Association, Mr. Tou Kam Seng; The Honorable President of the Federation of Macau Professional Insurance Intermediaries, Mr. Frank Ip; The Honorable President of the Macau Financial Markets Association, Mr. Chan Kam Chun; The Honorable President of the Association of Macau Financial Employees, Mr. Ng Chi Peng; The Honorable President of the Macau Money Changers Association, Ho Hao Chio; Distinguished guests, friends of media, dear colleagues; Spring is around although chill is occasionally being felt. On the occasion of this reception held in the melody of spring, we farewell the past and embrace the future. Here, I take the liberty of representing the Board of the Monetary Authority of Macao (AMCM) to extend our warmest welcome to Mr. Francis Tam, the Secretary for Economy and Finance; Mr. Zhou Zhikui, the Director of the Economic Affairs Department of the Liaison Office of the Central People’s Government in MSAR; our distinguished guests and friends of media. Moreover, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Mr. Francis Tam for his unremitting support and guidance; to the government departments, all sectors of the society and the business communities for their support and co-operation. Under the auspices of the Central Government and the visionary leadership of the MSAR Government, Macao manages to sustain its past growth momentum with favourable development noted in consumption, investment and trade. Basked in a buoyant market, unemployment rate continues to spiral downwards, GDP regains its double digit growth while surplus is noted in international balance of payment and fiscal account. The credit rating of Macao has also been raised from “stable” to “positive”.  2006 is another record year for the local financial field in the wake of Macao’s high economic growth and the prolonged favourable economic situation of the neighbouring regions. While the banking sector continues with the enhancement of risk management, it has also strived to diversify its range of financial products, broaden up its business network, implement different operational strategies and improve service quality. Accordingly, the sector succeeds in widening up its revenue source, expanding its operational scope, enhancing its quality of service and achieving better operational efficiency. As per statistics as at year end, total assets of the banking sector jumped 26.5% to MOP273.8 billion; deposits increased by 24.2% to MOP229.9 billion; loans stood at MOP76.4 billion, representing an increase of 17.1%; non-performing loan ratio was at record low of 1.1%. Overall annual profit jumped remarkably year-on-year by 30.1% to MOP3.96 billion. Capital adequacy ratio was 14.7%, far better than the benchmark set by the Basel Committee.  As for the insurance sector, continued growth was also witnessed in 2006. As at year end, gross premium registered a 10.5% growth to MOP2.48 billion. Growth momentum of non-life insurance continued to be strong by posting a year-on-year increase of 27.4% to MOP720 million. Life insurance remained stable with total premium grew at a rate of 4.7% to MOP1.75 billion. Private pension fund scheme has also secured a faster development. As at the end of 2006, the number of registered entities hugely increased by 44.4% to 309. Workforce covered by the scheme increased by 46.3% to 63,000. Assets under fund management increased by 21.4% to MOP2.8 billion.  Other trades such as money exchange, cash remittance and securities are also developing fastly with year-on-year growth of 22%, 34% and 70% respectively.  BIS Review 29/2007 1 
We continue to adopt a prudent investment strategy in managing the MSAR Reserves. As a result, it is capable of posting reasonable return in a turbulent market environment. As at the end of the year, the exchange reserves of the MSAR reached MOP73.1 billion, representing an increase of 36.8% when compared with the previous year. As regards MSAR Reserve Fund, the balance was MOP11.6 billion.  As far as monetary policy is concerned, the MSAR continues to adhere to a policy which maintains free flow of capital, free currency convertibility, market driven interest rate and the link of the MOP to the HKD. In the past year, we ensured the sufficient and timely circulation as well as the stability and convertibility of the MOP through the flexible use of different kinds of monetary policy instruments.  Simultaneously, effort has also been made to strengthen our supervision to cope with the changing market situation. To protect the stability and healthy development of the local financial system, we have coordinated and cooperated with other government departments to combat illicit financial activities.  As ever, we abide by the framework of applicable laws and regulations to carry out routine supervision on financial institutions through onsite inspection, offsite surveillance and other measures. In the past year, we did onsite inspection on 7 banks, 5 money changers, 2 exchange counters and 2 cash remittance companies. Furthermore, we strengthen and perfect formulation of relevant supervisory policies.  In the area of banking supervision, guideline on anti-money laundering was revised and put into force on November 12 last year. Besides, consultation on the draft “Guidelines on the Management of Country Risks” has been completed and is ready for promulgation and implementation this year. “Guidelines on the Risk Management of Electronic banking” has been revised and is ready for second consultation. “Licensing-Review and Approval Procedures” for financial institutions such as banks has been finalized. It is expected that through the use of these procedures, the approval process can be made more systematic, effective and transparent. Internally, “Onsite Inspection Manual” has been revised with an aim to achieve higher degree of standardization and better efficiency in daily operation. A survey was conducted last year to assess market risk. The related findings will be used as a base to establish market risk supervision capital requirement.  Basel II is planned to be implemented in Macao in stages to cope with the actual market situation. Under Pillar I, capital charge for credit risk will be appropriately adjusted and capital charge for operational risk will be introduced. Implementation will be made by taking into consideration the development of the credit market and credit risk management technique. For Pillar II, supervisory process will be enhanced. Supervision and capital requirement will apply based on the nature of risk, risk management techniques, measures and standard adopted by the financial institutions. Under Pillar III, banks may face higher and additional disclosure requirements which will be broadened gradually with an aim to maintain tighter market discipline. We will continue to reinforce cooperation with overseas supervisory authorities and strengthen cross-border comprehensive supervision in an effort to coordinate with the global implementation of Basel II.  On the insurance supervision front, while our initiatives are meant to facilitate stable market development, ensure fair market competition and protect the legitimate interest of the consumers, we also tend to fine tune the relevant laws and regulations, popularize insurance knowledge and promote development of the industry. In 2006, in response to the new laws on anti-money laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) implemented in Macao, we revised the “Guidelines on Prevention and Combating Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism in Insurance”. Besides, the limit of indemnity of the Employee’s Compensation Insurance Ordinance was adjusted upward to cope with the market situation. A 24-hr hotline was established to provide speedy response to public enquiries.  Anti-money laundering and combating terrorism financing carry weight in supervision. We have not only revised the related guidelines but also made special organization restructuring to support the cause. Both the Banking Supervision Department and Insurance Supervision Department have established their own special taskforce. A cross-departmental working committee is also established for coordination purpose. To enforce its execution, apart from routine offsite inspection, the Banking Supervision Department has already completed the first round AML onsite inspection on all institutions. Reports of the related findings and recommendations were sent to the entities for their reference. Indeed, we summarized our findings and discovered some common issues which we shared with the institutions in the form of a circular. An explanatory seminar is expected to be convened in April for sharing this information. Regarding insurance supervision, the related department has already embarked on an overall AML onsite inspection. Inspection will first be carried 2 BIS Review 29/2007 
out on all life insurance companies, followed by non-life insurance companies. A report similar in nature to the one compiled by the Banking Supervision Department will be prepared subsequently. Support and coordination from the business sector is expected.  In the past year, we actively participated in the MSAR government trans-departmental AML taskforce. We assisted and coordinated in the establishment of the Financial Intelligence Office. Moreover, we approached the International Monetary Fund and received its technical assistance. The Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering/Offshore Group of Banking Supervisors (APG/OGBS) conducted a second mutual evaluation on our AML/CFT systems. To broaden our exposure, we assigned representatives to act as APG experts to perform similar evaluation on other APG members. Through participating in AML related activities, we have established good communication and close working relationship with the related international bodies and their members.  Apart from reinforcing financial supervision, the AMCM also dedicated efforts to foster financial development. All along, we have been maintaining good communication and close working relationship with the participants, who have shared with us many opinions in relation to business development and supervision. Our collaborative effort helps to facilitate the stable and healthy development of the Macao financial market. Internationally, we have been maintaining communication with relevant overseas supervisory authorities in sharing constructive ideas relating to the introduction of cross-border financial business, cooperation on cross-border supervision and the establishment of cross-border financial facilities.  Apart from regular bilateral meetings, we executed a “Financial Cooperation Arrangement” with the Shenzhen Central Sub-branch of the People’s Bank of China and a “Letter of Intent for the Cooperation in the Development of Payment and Settlement System” with the Shenzhen Financial Electronic Settlement Centre in 2006. Besides, we were entrusted with the mission to organize a MSAR government delegation and an entrepreneur delegation to participate in the “Pan-Pearl River Delta Region Financial Services Forum” held in Hong Kong. We joined force with the Macau Insurers’ Association, the Macau Insurance Agents and Brokers Association and the Federation of Macau Professional Insurance Intermediaries to organize the third insurance exhibition. Furthermore, we jointly organized the “Mainland, Hong Kong and Macao Onsite/Offsite Inspection Seminar” in Yunnan with the State Administration and Foreign Exchange and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.  We are confident that the economic growth of Macao will sustain and the business of the financial sector will continue to flourish. However, the international economic and financial ecology is undergoing some changes. Macao is receiving more and more attention internationally. The financial sector is expected to encounter more challenges after the flying colours achieved in past few years. Challenges do not necessarily arise from the limitation of business development. They may also come from the continued requirement in risk management enhancement or even external factors beyond our control.  Despite the tremendous challenges ahead, we believe that all financial institutions have already mapped out strategies to enhance risk management, swiftly adapt to changing market environment, provide more financial products and services that would be conducive to the development of the local economy and society, facilitate the sophistication and stable development of the local financial market. Being a supervisor and facilitator, AMCM will strive to maintain the stability of the financial system by further improving the supervisory teams and policies, strengthening routine supervision, perfecting related law and guidelines, expanding financial infrastructure, maintaining close communication with institutions and engaging in cross-border cooperation with overseas supervisory authorities and actively containing illicit financial activities.  Let us work together to lift our financial sector to a higher level in the international market. Finally, I would like to wish all of you happiness, health and prosperity.  Thank you.

Krzysztof Rybiński: SEPA and the payment system in Poland Speech by Mr Krzysztof Rybiński, Deputy President of the National Bank of Poland, at the 13th Bank Forum “Regulatory changes in European banking – outcomes for banks and the economy in Poland”, Warsaw, 14 March 2007. *      *      * Welcome to the session devoted to the SEPA project – Single Euro Payments Area – in the context of the Polish payment system.  When you google SEPA, the first website on the results list is the site of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, but what closely follows is the ECB’s website on SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area). The pagerank of both these sites is 6, which means that they are important in the Internet.  Since the introduction of the euro banknotes and coins in 2002, consumers have been able to make cash payments throughout the euro area from a single purse using a single currency. The SEPA project represents the next major step towards closer European integration; it will allow consumers to make cashless payments throughout the euro area from a single account under the same basic conditions, regardless of their location. In 2002, the banking industry took up this challenging project by creating the European Payments Council (EPC). The EPC is defining the new rules and procedures for euro payments. To do that, it has involved not only the stakeholders in the euro area, but also those in other countries of the European Union, Poland obviously included, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. Communities outside the euro area will thus have the opportunity to participate in euro payment systems, and will be able to adopt SEPA standards and practices, thereby contributing to the establishment of a single market for payment services.  The EPC plans first SEPA products to come on the market at the beginning of the next year. Therefore, today’s Bank Forum is an excellent opportunity for an in-depth discussion on the role and place of the Polish payment infrastructure in the SEPA world. Ladies and Gentlemen, I am pleased to present you the discussants of our panel, in alphabetical order: Mr. Ryszard Drużyński, Vice President of Raiffeisen Bank Polska,  Mr. Krzysztof Kalicki, President of the Management Board of Deutsche Bank Polska,  Mr. Ronnie Richardson, President of the Management Board of Kredyt Bank,  Mr. Witold Zieliński, Vice President of the Management Board of Citibank Handlowy. I would like this discussion to be broad and dynamic, that's why feel free to join it.  First, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that changes ahead of us are needed to move towards a more integrated payments market, which will bring substantial economic benefits. The SEPA will not only introduce more comparable services, but will also foster competition and drive innovation. Institutions that are able to embrace new technological developments and offer customers additional services will benefit from this new integrated market. In a competitive and integrated economy, a forward-looking view is required so that retail payments have a level of safety and efficiency that is comparable with the best national systems in place today. Undoubtedly, this approach will considerably influence the balance of power on the European market of payment services, as well as on our local market. The proposed mechanisms will favour consolidation processes in the sector of payment infrastructure providers, and possibly also in the banking sector itself. SEPA stands for (S)Speed, (E)Efficiency, (P)Positiveness and (A)Automatisation. It is important that the SEPA project is not viewed just as a “one-shot operation”, but rather as a continually evolving project that fosters European integration, seeking to improve all aspects of the euro area retail payments market on an ongoing basis. The SEPA will also make a notable contribution to the so-called Lisbon Agenda, which aims at fostering competitiveness and ensuring the continuous development of the European economy. The National Bank of Poland, as a forward-looking and acting institution, which supports development of the Polish banking sector, has been participating, for two years now, in the TARGET system, and is now proceeding with intensive preparation for the transition BIS Review 29/2007 1 
to the new platform – TARGET2. It is worth reminding that this initiative has led to a considerable drop in charges for cross-border transfers in the euro under correspondent banking, although for the time being the drop is of benefit mainly to banks, and hardly at all to clients. SEPA consists of the following elements: the single currency, a single set of euro payment instruments – credit transfers, direct debits and card payments, efficient processing infrastructures for euro payments, common technical standards, common business practices, a harmonised legal basis, and ongoing development of new customer-oriented services. I am sure than many of you are wondering "Why SEPA?". To answer this question we have to think like Europeans. Currently, the euro area economy is unable to fully exploit all the benefits of the Monetary Union. Customers face difficulties when making euro retail payments to other euro area countries, as these payments often turn out to be more time-consuming. As long as this is the case, the euro cannot be viewed as a fully implemented single currency. Despite the introduction of the euro in 1999 and the development of TARGET, the common large-value payment system for euro, low-value electronic payments (i.e. retail payments) continue to be processed differently throughout the euro area. Overall, the number and variety of payment instruments, standards and processing infrastructures for retail payments has not really changed since the introduction of the euro. In such an environment, to facilitate the flow of payments, companies with a substantial number of cross-border payments have to maintain bank accounts in all the countries in which they do business.  Imagine enterprises in Poland had to keep bank accounts in each voivodship in order to operate efficiently, and each voivodship had a different settlement system and different legal regulations. Would enterprises in such a situation be able to operate as efficiently as they do now? What would it mean for the costs and competitiveness of Polish banks and prices of payment services?  This fragmentation not only affects cross-border payments but also national euro payments, as it prevents innovation and competition on the euro area level. Payers and payees may also be subject to different rules and requirements depending on their country of origin. The creation of a common framework will create the opportunity for innovative payment solutions to be offered irrespective of national borders.  The goal of SEPA is thus to create an integrated, competitive and innovative retail payments market for all non-cash euro payments, which, in time, will be conducted entirely electronically. As such, SEPA will benefit all customers. New payment instruments will be available throughout the euro area, making life easier for both consumers and business. Consumers will need only one bank account. From this account, they will be able to make euro credit transfers and direct debit payments anywhere in the euro area as easily as they make national payments. They could, for instance, pay rent for children studying abroad, pay for a holiday home, or pay for services provided by European companies, e.g. mobile telephone services, insurance companies, utilities, etc. People who live, work or study outside their home country will no longer need one bank account at home and another one abroad. The use of payment cards will be more efficient, as consumers will be able to use the same card for all euro payments. This will reduce the necessity for people to carry cash. Innovative services can be offered to consumers irrespective of national borders. The long-term goal of the banking industry is that the SEPA payment instruments will only be used in electronic form. Payments can then be easily combined with other e-services in the case of both individual and corporate clients. These include e-invoicing, mobile or internet payment initiation, airline e-tickets, credit advice or e-reconciliation. As a consequence, consumers will spend less time handling payments. Everything will be easier, faster and cheaper ... in the long term. Payment cards are becoming a favourite payment instrument with consumers, and are increasingly replacing cheques and cash payments. The use of cards is thus expected to grow in the future. Thanks to the creation of a single euro payments area, acquirers will be able to process all SEPA-compliant card payments, even across borders. In the SEPA environment, merchants will be able to choose any card payment processing entity in the euro; this will increase competition and reduce costs.  2 BIS Review 29/2007 
Point-of-sale terminals in the euro area will become increasingly standardised. As a consequence, there will be a wider choice of terminal providers, and merchants will be able to accept a wider range of cards with a single terminal. The increased competition between payment card systems should also drive down fees. This is a vision of anticipated benefits for an integrated Europe, but the questions I would like to ask the panelists and all of you today are as follows: Will SEPA reinforce the competitiveness of Polish entrepreneurs?; How fast should we act?; What roles are there to be played and who should play them so as to ensure the success of the Polish economy, enterprises and consumers in the SEPA era? It seems to me that these are the key questions to be answered now so that Forum SEPA Polska could develop, in the months to come, an optimal strategy for launching new payment products in the Polish market. Let’s also have a look at our own local situation. By providing new payment instruments and euro area-wide infrastructures, SEPA will ensure that banks expand their business and compete on a euro area level, as any bank can offer its services more easily to any individual in the euro area. Banks can also expand their business by offering their customers value-added services on top of the SEPA products.  It is worth referring here to Regulation No 2560/2001 of the European Commission, which established the principle of equal charges for cross-border payments and comparable domestic payments within the EU, which in turn has created an imbalance between bank fees and costs of cross-border payments. This imbalance can only be overcome if the handling of cross-border payments is reorganised to become as efficient and inexpensive as the handling of national payments, which is the primary goal of SEPA. An aspect which deserves particular attention in the discussion on SEPA is the harmonisation of the law within the payment area. The proposed Payment Services Directive (PSD) establishes the necessary legal framework for SEPA payments and will also apply to existing national payment products. The aim of the Directive is to harmonise the market access requirements for non-bank payment service providers. This will create a level playing field with enhanced competition in national markets.  The Directive will provide clarity and certainty with regard to the core rights and obligations of users and providers of payment services. It will also provide the necessary legal framework for SEPA, as it will harmonise existing, and differing, national legal requirements. Please note that the Eurosystem sees SEPA as “an integrated market for payment services which is subject to effective competition and where there is no distinction between cross-border and national payments within the euro area.” Over the long term, all euro area payments will become domestic, reaching a level of safety and efficiency that is at least on par with the best performing national payment systems today. Let us consider together the potential benefits of SEPA for the Polish market participants. The following questions seem to be of particular importance here: • What’s the role and place of Polish payment infrastructure in the SEPA world? • Will SEPA increase the consolidation of the Polish banking sector?  • Will SEPA reinforce the competitiveness of Polish entrepreneurs?  • What roles are there to be played and who should play them so as to ensure that SEPA contributes to the success of the Polish economy and increased consumer satisfaction?  • What benefits may the Polish payment market participants gain before Poland joins the euro area? Now, let me ask the Presidents to take the floor. BIS Review 29/2007 3 
BIS Review 28/2007 1 Svein Gjedrem: The economic outlook in Norway Address by Mr Svein Gjedrem, Governor of Norges Bank (Central Bank of Norway), to invited foreign embassy representatives, Norges Bank, Oslo, 22 March 2007.  The address is based on the assessments presented at Norges Bank’s press conference following the Executive Board’s monetary policy meeting on 15 March, Monetary Policy Report 1/07 and on previous speeches. Please note that the text below may differ slightly from the actual presentation.  The Charts in pdf-format can be found on the Norges Bank’s website. *      *      * Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,  First of all, I would like to welcome you to Norges Bank.  This event gives me an opportunity to discuss developments in the Norwegian economy and to present Norges Bank’s view of the economic outlook for Norway. It also gives us an occasion to discuss other issues of mutual interest in an informal setting.  The Norwegian economy has been affected by several positive supply-side shocks over the last decade. I am thinking in terms of the effects from increased global trade and freer flow of labour across national borders. I want to discuss how these shocks have had an impact on economic growth and inflation. These shocks have also affected prices in the Norwegian housing market, and they have had a strong impact on the income from the petroleum sector and thereby the transfer of funds to the Norwegian petroleum fund.  Economic developments Monetary policy in Norway is oriented towards low and stable inflation, with annual consumer price inflation of close to 2.5 per cent over time. Norges Bank operates a flexible inflation targeting regime. Both variability in inflation and variability in output and employment are given weight in interest-rate setting.   Inflation decelerated markedly from the end of the 1980s to the mid-1990s and has since been low and stable with considerably lower variability than earlier. Over the past 5-10 years, inflation has been fairly close to, but somewhat lower than the target.  
2 BIS Review 28/2007  The Norwegian economy is now growing strongly, following a pronounced upswing since summer 2003. Growth has been stronger than during the economic upturn in the mid-1990s. The continuous growth period of recent years is the longest ever recorded in the quarterly national accounts, which includes figures back to 1978. Average real growth rates for the past three years were well above 4 per cent.   Since the economic recovery started, it has gradually broadened. Capacity utilisation is now high in most industries, and there are reports of limited capacity in most regions. The number of unfilled vacancies is rising, and labour shortages are reported in almost every occupational category. There are shortages of drivers, pre-school teachers, supervisors, engineers, carpenters, architects, auditors, accountants, IT personnel and health workers. It has probably not been since the 1970s that we find such widespread reports of purely physical production constraints, for example now in the form of shortages of rigs and other equipment in the petroleum industry or shortages of plank, concrete and insulation in the construction industry.  
BIS Review 28/2007 3  Unemployment has fallen markedly over the past year. The pace of decline and the level of unemployment are reminiscent of two earlier cyclical peaks, one in the mid-1980s and the one that began at the end of the 1990s and continued into the present decade. Both booms culminated in sharply accelerating cost and wage inflation.  Supply-side shocks to the Norwegian economy The combination of strong growth, high capacity utilisation and low inflation is a reflection of favourable global developments and a number of positive supply-side shocks to the Norwegian economy.  The global expansion of recent years has resulted in strong growth in Norwegian export industries. Employment has increased and unemployment has declined. The favourable labour market has boosted household optimism and supported private consumption. Strong demand growth and solid profitability have also paved the way for growth in business fixed investment in Norway.  So far, the weakening of the US housing market has not had pronounced spill over effects. Growth in China and India is strong and the euro area is experiencing a broad-based upturn. Global growth is probably less dependent on demand for goods and services in the US than was the case earlier.   The global expansion has also resulted in high prices for many Norwegian export goods. The increase in oil prices over the past 4-5 years has been very important. High oil prices over a longer period have 
4 BIS Review 28/2007 boosted oil investments and there are prospects that the high investment level will be sustained in the coming years.  Oil prices peaked around USD 75 per barrel in summer 2006. Later in autumn, prices fell. Current futures prices indicate that market participants believe prices will remain above USD 60 per barrel in the coming years.  A fall in prices in a number of commodity markets at the beginning of 2007 raised the question of whether the pronounced price rise of recent years was being reversed. The experience of previous commodity price cycles indicates that rising prices gradually lead to increased supply and reduced demand. This in turn leads to a fall in prices.  Following a long period of expansion, international financial markets were marked by unrest around the end of February. It is still too early to say whether the turbulence signals a weakening of global growth prospects.   Increased integration of China, India and other emerging economies into world trade, in conjunction with lower tariffs and reduced trade barriers, has led to a decline in prices for imported finished goods. This effect has been strengthened by a significant increase in the share of imports from low-cost countries. For example, clothing and footwear, audiovisual equipment, furniture and white goods have shown very strong price declines.   Low prices for imported consumer goods, combined with high prices for our commodity exports, have resulted in a strong improvement in Norway’s terms of trade. Since 2002, the terms of trade have 
BIS Review 28/2007 5 improved by about 40 per cent. A similar situation has not been seen since World War I, when earnings in the shipping industry and other export industries were exceptionally high for a period.   The supply of foreign labour has increased markedly after EU enlargement in 2004. Over the past two years, these labour inflows have accounted for more than 30 per cent of growth in our labour force. Norwegian companies have also been able to be considerably bolder in undertaking new assignments and investments knowing that they can procure labour throughout Europe. In addition to increased labour inflows from Poland, Lithuania and other central European countries, we have long benefited from inflows of labour from Sweden. Many workers are on temporary assignment and their consumption is primarily concentrated in their home country. The Norwegian economy has seen a net capacity increase.   Inward labour migration delayed the fall in unemployment in this expansion. It has also reduced bottlenecks in the economy and curbed the impact of the fall in unemployment on wage growth. Labour inflows have also had a dampening effect on wage growth, probably because the wage level of foreign workers is somewhat lower than for Norwegian labour.  Moderate wage growth has reduced labour costs’ share of mainland business-sector income, particularly in tradable goods sectors. In manufacturing, the wage share has shown a trend fall since the mid-1990s and the level has been the lowest since 1970 in the past few years.  
6 BIS Review 28/2007  The wage share has fallen also in many other OECD countries. Emerging economies’ entry into global trade has resulted in a sharp increase in the supply of labour. The result has been a fall in the global price of labour relative to the return on capital. The wage share equilibrium may therefore have been reduced. Increased possibilities for relocating production abroad may have weakened labour’s bargaining power and moderated pay demands.   During the current upturn, we have also seen that the rise in prices for domestically produced goods and services has been lower than implied by historical relationships between inflation and wage and productivity growth. Increased competition in product markets may have dampened the rise in prices.  In a survey from Norges Bank’s regional network 58 per cent of the companies responded that competition has increased in the past 2-3 years, while only 15 per cent reported that competition has decreased. In retail trade and services, almost 70 per cent responded that competition has intensified. Many of the companies that experience increased competition attribute this to the entry of more operators, including foreign operators, into the market.  
BIS Review 28/2007 7  The Norwegian business sector has been quick to integrate information technology. This applies both to companies competing on international markets and those supplying goods and services to the domestic market. In comparison with other countries, it is particularly productivity gains in banks and other service sectors that stand out. Examples are automated processes and swifter payments in the financial industry and improved inventory and management systems in commerce and transport.  In sum, these positive supply side shocks have increased the growth capacity of the Norwegian economy, and have played their part in keeping inflation at a low level.  Monetary policy assessments  Monetary policy influences the economy with a lag. Norges Bank sets the interest rate with a view to stabilising inflation close to the target in the medium term. The interest rate path should provide a reasonable balance between the path for inflation and the path for capacity utilisation.  When we reduced the interest rate in 2003, demand and output rapidly picked up. However, it took a long time for employment to rise and the next phase from a pick-up in employment to a fall in unemployment was also long. But now the upturn has entered into a mature phase. The enterprises in our regional network report that capacity constraints are now limiting further growth. Unemployment has fallen markedly over the past year. Wage growth appears to be rising, but so far only gradually. Prices for many inputs and services and building materials are rising markedly. Consumer price inflation is also expected to pick up further ahead. Thus, interest rates are rising.  
8 BIS Review 28/2007 The experience of previous business cycles has shown that wage and price inflation may increase markedly in a late phase of the upturn. Higher interest rates will counter such a development. However, we must also prevent inflation from becoming entrenched well below 2.5 per cent. We will therefore be mindful of the effects of higher interest rates on the krone exchange rate when inflation is low. Positive supply-side conditions that have held down inflation so far suggest a gradual approach, so that we can assess the effects of interest rate increases and other new information on economic developments.   At the meeting on 15 March, Norges Bank’s Executive Board presented the interest rate path shown in the chart. The Board decided that the key policy rate should lie in the interval 4-5 per cent in the period to the publication of the next Monetary Policy Report on 27 June, conditional on economic developments that are broadly in line with projections. Furthermore, the key policy rate is expected to move up to about 5 per cent around the end of 2007. Economic developments are uncertain. The uncertainty surrounding the interest rate ahead is illustrated by the shaded area in the chart, which is intended to capture the outcome with a 70 per cent probability.  Long-term interest rates, income growth and house prices Favourable economic developments in Norway have had an impact on developments in our property markets. House prices have risen sharply over the past 14 years. Real house prices have almost trebled. The rise in house prices has been considerably stronger than earlier and has spanned a long period. With the exception of a few months in 2003, house prices have risen continuously since 1992. This is the second longest period of rising real prices since 1819. Statistics for earlier years do not exist.  
BIS Review 28/2007 9  Norway is not the only country where house prices have shown a strong rise over a long period. House price inflation has been particularly high in Ireland and the Netherlands, but Denmark, the UK and Spain also stand out. The countries where house price inflation has been high are the same countries where economic growth has been strongest.   Since prices are rising in tandem in many countries, it is natural to look for common driving forces. With increasing cross-border flows of intermediate goods, capital and increasingly so labour, prices will largely reflect growth and competition in the global economy. If capital or labour becomes too expensive in one country, businesses can relocate production. Prices for fixed factors of production, such as property, will on the other hand reflect income developments in different countries. Consequently, the rise in property prices will tend to be highest in those countries where income growth is highest.  
10 BIS Review 28/2007    External and domestic interest rates are low in an environment of solid growth. Long-term interest rates have fallen sharply both in nominal and real terms since the beginning of the 1990s. Inflation has declined and contributed to a fall in nominal interest rates. A more stable inflation environment also results in lower real interest rates when investors become more certain about returns. Furthermore, it would appear that high saving in some parts of the world is pushing down long-term interest rates. Saving is high both in oil-producing countries, China and other Asian countries.  Long-term interest rates in Norway largely shadow external interest rates because like other countries Norway is keeping inflation in check. Norwegian households primarily finance house purchases by means of floating-rate loans. Long-term interest rates are still of considerable importance because they provide information about the future path of short-term interest rates that borrowers can expect over time. Unusually low short-term interest rates have probably also boosted the rate of increase in house prices in recent years, but this effect will be reversed when the interest rate is raised to a more normal level. Short-term interest rates have influenced the path for house prices over the past 15 years, but periods of low interest rates are followed by periods of higher interest rates. Norges Bank’s key policy rate is therefore of limited importance for house price inflation over a period of 15 to 20 years.   The housing stock in Norway, which numbers a good 2.2 million dwellings, shows little change from one year to the next. As a result, higher demand for housing will primarily translate into higher prices in the short term. In the 1990s, housing starts in Norway were fairly low in relation to growth in the number of households. Moreover, population growth has been higher in recent years, largely reflecting 
BIS Review 28/2007 11 a high level of immigration. In 2006, the population increased by more than 40 000 and the number of households by roughly 30 000.  Furthermore, migration patterns in Norway follow the business cycle. Migration to densely populated areas is now rising. Demands for high standards and new building regulations have also pushed up housing construction costs and thereby house prices.  The main determinants of house price inflation have long been income, unemployment, interest rates and residential construction. Over the past few years, inward migration and domestic migration patterns may also have contributed. In the past year, however, house price inflation has been higher than implied by these factors. A large share of the increase in 2006 cannot be explained by previous patterns. Developments since the beginning of the 1990s may have engendered expectations that house prices will only continue to rise. This may have increased house purchases for pure investment purposes and induced younger buyers to enter the housing market earlier than otherwise.  The housing market may now be in a state of euphoria.   The rise in house prices has been accompanied by a sharp increase in household debt. In Norway, household debt is now almost twice the level of disposable income, and the debt to income ratio is the highest ever. It is higher than in Sweden and the UK, but lower than in Denmark and the Netherlands.  Norway is among the countries with the highest share of owner-occupied dwellings, at around 80 per cent. This high proportion partly accounts for the high mortgage debt of households. In recent years, new loan products have also been launched, facilitating mortgage equity withdrawal. Housing wealth has become more liquid. Borrowers have greater scope for choosing repayment profiles. We cannot identify the exact level of household debt that can be sustained over time, but the rapid build-up of debt makes households more vulnerable.  
12 BIS Review 28/2007  Housing investment for the household sector as a whole is now being fully debt-financed, which means an increase in net debt. It would appear that household saving has fallen markedly in Norway in the recent past. Saving was negative in the latter half of 2006, which is the first time saving has fallen since 1988. The pronounced fall in saving indicates that households are taking greater chances.  At the same time, government revenues and savings are high. The long period of prosperity and government budget surpluses may have engendered a sense of security which is also affecting household saving and house purchases.  Petroleum and the Government Pension Fund – Global  High oil and gas production and high prices, combined with high returns, have resulted in a rapid rise in the value of the Government Pension Fund in recent years.  The Norwegian authorities have been successful in ensuring that the bulk of the petroleum wealth benefits Norwegian society as a whole. Both the state’s ownership interests through the State’s Direct Financial Interest in petroleum activities (SDFI) and the tax system have been important. The companies that extract oil earn a reasonable return on their investments and have incentives to invest, but the economic rent has essentially accrued to the general public.  The authorities have so far also been successful in smoothing spending of petroleum revenues over time. This is important for several reasons. First, it is misleading to look upon the cash flow from 
BIS Review 28/2007 13 petroleum activities as income. The appropriate economic perspective is to see the transfer of cash flow to foreign investments as a way of transferring capital from one account to another – from petroleum to foreign securities. By doing so, we diversify risk.  Second, the size of the cash flow from petroleum activities varies. If petroleum revenues were to be spent as they accrue, this would lead to wide fluctuations in demand in the Norwegian economy.  Third, petroleum revenue spending has an impact on competitiveness in Norwegian business and industry. A high level and substantial variations in petroleum revenue spending would have a negative impact on internationally exposed industries.   The establishment of the Government Pension Fund – Global and the spending guidelines for petroleum revenues are part of the response to these challenges.  The Fund is approaching the nominal value of one year’s GDP and may reach two in the course of the next decade. This is based on the assumption that oil prices remain high over the next few years and then fall to about USD 30 per barrel.   The government bases its withdrawals from the Fund on an average real return of 4 per cent for financing current expenditure. Given this spending rule, the return may come to finance more than 15 per cent of government expenditure in 10 years, which clearly shows that sound management of our petroleum wealth generates considerable benefits. The return represents future income that we forego if we draw on this wealth today. But even with this source of income, more than 80 per cent of 
14 BIS Review 28/2007 expenditure must be covered by other sources. Financing the large pension payments that will have to be disbursed in the coming decades will be very demanding in any event.  I have talked about some of the supply-side shocks that have had a positive effect on the Norwegian economy. Norway is now reaping the benefits of globalisation through increased international trade and freer labour flows across national borders. Globalisation also has its challenges and although I have not delved into these in my speech today, I would be delighted to discuss these and other issues with you in the question and answer session.  Thank you for your attention!  
Donald L Kohn: Asset-pricing puzzles, credit risk, and credit derivatives  Remarks by Mr Donald L Kohn, Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Conference on Credit Risk and Credit Derivatives, Washington DC, 22 March 2007. *      *      * Good afternoon. I am pleased to participate in the Board’s conference on credit risk and credit derivatives. Song Han, Matt Pritsker, and Hao Zhou have worked hard to put together a stimulating program of cutting-edge research in this area.1 Your conference focuses on improving our understanding of credit risk and credit derivatives, but I will begin my talk by taking a step back and discussing a wider range of asset markets, in which our understanding is also limited. Then I will examine how the research in this conference can help sharpen our focus on this broader range of asset markets. At the Federal Reserve, we have considerable interest in credit risk and credit derivatives. As these markets develop and become more complete, they facilitate risk transfer and diversification, thereby increasing the resilience of our financial system. With participants coming to rely more on these markets to manage risk, we have focused increasingly on their liquidity and structure. We have worked closely with the private sector to strengthen the clearing and settlement infrastructure and to understand how these markets will function under stress. But my emphasis today will be not the structure or mechanics of credit markets but rather the information contained in the prices we observe in these markets. We at the Federal Reserve use this information in nearly every area of our responsibility. For example, in our roles as bank supervisors and protectors of financial stability, we monitor the credit spreads of financial institutions as early warning signs of possible financial stress. In our role as monetary policy makers, we analyze information from credit-risk markets to get readings on the cost of capital to businesses and on forward-looking indicators of the health of the corporate sector that can have implications for future macroeconomic developments.  Extracting information from asset prices  As a consequence, the staff at the Federal Reserve puts considerable effort into research on asset prices and into reporting the results of that research to policymakers. One reason we do so is to try to understand the expectations that households, businesses, and market participants have about the future. Expectations are critical to understanding the economy and developments in the financial system. Of course, we look at a great deal of data from the nonfinancial side of the economy, such as gross domestic product (GDP) growth, the unemployment rate, and changes in the prices of goods and services. These data certainly reflect expectations but not always in a transparent way. And, these data take some time to compile and so are never available in real time.  Because financial asset prices embody expectations about the future, they also contain forward-looking information about prospective developments, and many are available continuously and instantaneously. We pay attention to an extensive range of asset prices, including those of Treasury securities (both nominal and real), corporate debt and equities, and derivatives. Although it is not easy, we use these asset prices to tease out information about expectations that help us to interpret and predict the pace of economic activity and prices. The price of an asset reflects the future cash flows that investors expect to receive from owning that asset. The price also reflects a risk premium, which is the excess expected return over the risk-free rate that investors require for holding risky assets in their portfolios. Each asset’s risk premium depends on the asset’s risk – as measured by the possible variability of its cash flows from their expected level – and on investors' risk aversion, which represents the extent of investors’ appetite for risk. And we try to measure and understand the elements of the risk premium, in addition to the embedded expectations.                                                        1  Mike Gibson, Song Han, Matt Pritsker, and Hao Zhou, of the Board's staff, contributed to these remarks.

In equity markets, corporate earnings are the future cash flows that affect equity prices. Given the market’s outlook for corporate earnings – as embodied, for example, in the predictions of market analysts – we make a crude estimate of the risk premium on equities as the difference between the ratio of trend earnings to price and a real long-term Treasury yield. On occasion, we go further and use structural economic models to decompose the risk premium into components related to risk and to investors’ risk appetite. In the credit market, the relevant future cash flows are the coupons on corporate debt, less an allowance for expected losses from future defaults. In one exercise, we forecast future defaults with a simple regression model and estimate the credit-risk premium as the difference between corporate yields and Treasury yields that is in excess of what would be required to compensate investors for their estimates of expected credit losses. We also estimate a term structure of credit-risk premiums by repeating this analysis using debt that has different maturities. To judge what market prices of risk might be telling us, we try to understand how the resulting credit-risk premiums relate to other sources of information, such as the strength of business balance sheets, historical levels of risk premiums, and premiums observed in related markets, like that for equities. This approach helps us to assess the current attitudes and expectations of market participants as well as possible future movements in risk premiums under alternative scenarios. We look to prices in Treasury markets and in markets for interest rate options and futures to infer investors’ expected future path of monetary policy and their uncertainty about that path. To do so, we need to model term premiums to tease out the links between long-term interest rates and investors’ expectations of future short-term rates. We also compare the Treasury yield curve with the prices on Treasury inflation-protected securities to infer expected inflation, a key variable tracked by monetary policy makers. Although we use a variety of techniques for extracting information from asset prices, what we can learn has limits. First, asset prices are tough to work with. They change rapidly and are subject to short-run technical factors – swings in prices that are not related to fundamental and persistent shifts in supply and demand. Second, and perhaps even more important, how asset prices embody risk and investors’ risk attitudes is complicated and varies over time. We must use models to extract information on risk and risk preferences from prices, and because all models are simplifications of reality, we have to recognize that the results are only approximations of the underlying attitudes and circumstances and thus are subject to error. Asset-pricing puzzles Researchers are well aware of the difficulties of decomposing an asset’s required return into components that are related to expected future cash flows, risk aversion, and risk. Moreover, risk preferences that should be related in a predictable way across markets often do not appear to be so. For example, the risk preferences required to fit consumption data from the goods market are inconsistent with the risk preferences implied by prices in the equity market. This problem is well known to most economists and to everyone in this room and is known as the "equity-premium puzzle." The equity premium is defined as the return that an investor expects to earn on a broad equity index in excess of the return on a U.S. Treasury security. Although theory suggests that the equity premium should be related to investors’ risk preferences as well as the fundamental volatility of the corporate sector, it is difficult to find plausible risk preferences that can rationalize the high level of the historical equity premium. Also, we observe that required returns appear to vary over time, but we do not understand all the reasons for the fluctuation. Both of these problems complicate our interpretation of what implications, if any, movements in equity markets have for the macroeconomy. The equity-premium puzzle is not the only aspect of the behavior of financial asset prices that is difficult to reconcile with economic theory or experience in related markets. A second puzzle is the "credit-spread puzzle." The spread between a corporate bond and a similar-maturity Treasury bond compensates an investor for the risk that the bond’s issuer will default and recoveries on the defaulted bond will be low. Credit-risk spreads vary substantially over the cycle, and right now they are on the low side of historical experience. However, over long periods, actual percentage losses on corporate bonds have been well below historical averages of credit spreads at all maturities, especially in the high-grade, short-maturity segment of the market. Again, it is difficult to reconcile this observation with 2 BIS Review 28/2007 
standard models of investor preferences. Other explanatory factors, such as the different tax treatment of corporate and Treasury bonds, appear to explain only part of the puzzle. A third puzzle concerns the behavior of financial market volatility. Volatility and measures of expected volatility derived from options prices vary over time but not in ways that are easy to link to economic fundamentals or to the variation of expected returns in asset markets. Moreover, the relationship between financial market volatility and the volatility of macroeconomic variables such as GDP is not well understood. A fourth puzzle related to the pricing of risk concerns the term premium, which is the additional compensation that investors require to hold longer-term securities. We estimate from the Treasury market that the term premium has declined substantially in recent years to unusually low levels, which has contributed to the inversion of the yield curve. But we do not understand why, and consequently we do not know to what extent we are seeing a permanent decline in the term premium – perhaps due to a general reduction in the volatility of economic activity and inflation over the past twenty-five years. Or we may be seeing a temporary decline due to the influence of recent macroeconomic conditions or special factors affecting the demand for long-term bonds. In addition to these well-known puzzles, are also a large number of puzzles across all asset markets that I will group under the common theme of risk harmonization. Risk-harmonization puzzles concern whether a given risk is priced the same way in all markets in which that risk is traded. In the absence of transaction costs, broadly defined, the law of one price should hold – there should be no risk-free arbitrage – and all risks should be priced the same way in all markets. In fact, risk harmonization is limited because transaction costs, viewed in a broad way, are quite material in many markets. A broad notion of transaction costs includes not only the direct fees paid when transacting and trading but also the full set of risks that are involved when arbitraging among markets. These include various types of basis risk, which is the risk that long and short positions exposed to the same risk in different markets might not offset each other. Another important risk is model risk, which is the risk of misjudging an apparent price anomaly when trading owing to not having the correct model. Some of the conference papers focus on markets in which risk harmonization appears to be incomplete. How the common lens of credit risk improves our understanding Papers in this conference contribute to our overall understanding of how credit risk, as well as other risks such as those associated with volatility and liquidity, are priced in financial markets. One of the contributions of the conference is that it views many of the asset-pricing puzzles through the common lens of credit risk. This approach holds the hope of addressing the various puzzles in an internally consistent way that helps us to understand how the puzzles may be related. One strand of the literature on the equity-premium puzzle attempts to explain the puzzle with a somewhat controversial refinement of standard risk preferences. The first paper in the conference examines the plausibility of these preferences by analyzing whether they can also explain the average pattern of credit spreads in the bond market. The results are mixed. Part of the credit-spread puzzle is explained, lending some credence to these preferences, and suggesting the two puzzles are related, but a part remains unexplained. And the paper identifies better modeling of the situation in which firms are forced into default as one research direction that may help to explain the remaining part of the credit-spread puzzle. This research direction is pursued in a separate paper in the conference. A second paper at the conference also studies the relationship between equity prices and credit risk but does so from a different perspective by asking whether credit risk is appropriately priced in the stock markets. To address this question, it focuses on companies that are heavily exposed to systematic risk of financial distress – that is, they are relatively likely to experience financial distress during future downturns – and then studies whether the stocks earn a positive premium for this risk. The main finding is that investors in those companies do not earn a premium for distress risk in the stock market. This result suggests a possible failure of risk harmonization in the stock market, which in turn raises the deeper question of identifying why this failure in risk harmonization is not arbitraged away. In short, papers in the conference deepen our knowledge of some of the asset-pricing puzzles, but they also highlight new aspects of the puzzles that remain to be explained. BIS Review 28/2007 3 
How credit derivatives markets can improve our understanding  This leads to my last topic, which is how credit derivatives markets provide new ways for us to uncover market perceptions of risk. Like all derivatives (such as options and swaps), credit derivatives allow for credit risk to be unbundled and traded independently from other types of risk, which makes it easier to price and measure the different types of risk. Here I will focus on two examples. The first involves our ability to infer the market's perception of default risk. In the bad old days, about ten years ago, the best way to infer credit risk was from the prices of corporate bonds, but bond prices are contaminated by differences in coupons, taxes, option-like features, bond covenants, and the illiquidity of the corporate bond market itself. All of these features meant that the modeling error involved in the process resulted in credit-risk measures that were noisy and potentially biased. Now, instead of looking to the bond market to measure default risk, we are increasingly turning to the market for credit default swaps, or CDS. CDS are more standardized than corporate bonds, and, over time, they have also become more liquid. They therefore provide us with new, and in many cases more precise, measures of credit risk. These measures in turn can sharpen our measures of the pricing puzzles. In addition, because the CDS market helps us to strip out the credit-risk component from bond prices, that market also gives us a clearer picture of how important non-credit-risk components of bond prices, such as liquidity, are priced. The second example involves the pricing of default correlation. Default correlation measures the tendency of firms to default at the same time. Suppose a bank makes a set of loans that appear to be safe when looked at individually. Whether the loans are likely to default at nearly the same time can represent the difference between whether the bank remains healthy or has the potential to become insolvent. For this reason, the modeling of default correlations, and how correlations change with economic conditions, is one of the most important inputs into measures of portfolio credit risk at banks. Default correlations and how they are modeled are also important to bank regulators and are heavily emphasized within the Basel II capital standards. Collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs, are one of a number of financial instruments whose prices are sensitive to the pattern of default correlations. As a result, the prices of these instruments provide us with a forward-looking picture of the market’s perception of default correlations and an indication of how the risks of changes in correlation are priced. Of course, as some of the papers in the conference demonstrate, the pricing of correlation-sensitive instruments is, putting it generously, somewhat less than straightforward. For that reason, there is substantial model risk involved in making inferences from these prices. Nevertheless, the prices of these instruments provide a blurry view of default correlations that I expect will improve through time as credit derivatives markets continue to grow and mature. Credit derivatives, like all derivatives, are in zero net supply, and, abstracting from the very important issue of counterparty credit risk, they neither add to nor subtract from the stock of financial risk in the economy. They do, however, provide new and more-efficient ways for sharing and hedging the risks that do exist, and they facilitate the transfer of those risks to those who are most willing to evaluate and bear them.  As a consequence, as the credit derivatives market continues to develop and deepen, my guess, and it is just a guess, is that cleaner measures of credit risk will, all else being equal, reduce the costs of arbitraging between markets and will improve the harmonization of risk across markets – one of the asset-pricing puzzles I highlighted. Two of the other puzzles I described earlier are the credit-spread and equity-premium puzzles. At least a part of these puzzles may be due to imperfect risk sharing among active market participants. If this is indeed part of the puzzle, then financial innovations such as credit derivatives may, again, all else being equal, reduce long-run average risk premiums in both the equity and credit markets, over time, by facilitating risk sharing among currently active market participants, provided that participants adequately understand and manage the risk of these products. That said, time will tell whether my speculations on this point are correct. Conclusion My message to you today has been that the Federal Reserve places a lot of emphasis on understanding financial asset prices to help it meet its public policy objectives. But in doing so, we are handicapped by the extent to which we do not understand important aspects of how financial assets 4 BIS Review 28/2007 
are priced. Your work as researchers in this field – a portion of which is show-cased at this conference – has been helpful in beginning to explain some of the puzzles, and more recent techniques and ideas together with the data series being generated in new markets hold the promise of more progress in the future. So, I will not keep you from your work any longer. Your contributions are important to the nation’s central bank. Please, go solve some puzzles.  BIS Review 28/2007 5 
Randall S Kroszner: Recent innovations in credit markets  Remarks by Mr Randall S Kroszner, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, to the 2007 Credit Markets Symposium at the Charlotte Branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Charlotte, North Carolina, 22 March 2007. *      *      * I am delighted to be the opening speaker at this Credit Markets Symposium. The time certainly is ripe for an open dialogue among market participants, risk-management professionals, and policymakers. Credit markets have been evolving very rapidly in recent years. New instruments for transferring credit risk have been introduced and loan markets have become more liquid. Asset managers have become an important force in a wider range of credit markets. Taken together, these changes have transformed the process through which credit demands are met and credit risks are allocated and managed. As I will discuss, I believe these developments generally have enhanced the efficiency and the stability of the credit markets and the broader financial system by making credit markets more transparent and liquid, by creating new instruments for unbundling and managing credit risks, and by dispersing credit risks more broadly. Interestingly, this is not the first time that we have witnessed innovations in derivatives markets that have led to these types of benefits. Later, I will very briefly draw some parallels between recent developments in credit derivatives and the development of agricultural futures in the mid-nineteenth century. For all their benefits, these developments have posed some significant challenges to market participants. The complexity of some instruments creates difficulties with respect to valuation, risk measurement, and risk management. Also, the trading of certain instruments has at times run well ahead of developments in the infrastructure necessary for clearing and settling those trades. Although impressive progress is being made toward addressing these challenges, I believe they need continuing attention from market participants and policymakers. Recent developments The evolution of the credit markets has been spurred by the astonishing growth of new credit instruments, particularly credit derivatives. The notional amount of credit derivatives outstanding has doubled each year for the past five years; it totaled $20 trillion at the end of June 2006, according to statistics compiled by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).  The bulk of credit derivatives outstanding consist of single-name credit default swaps, or single-name CDS, which reference the obligations of a single obligor.1 Derivatives are sometimes faulted for their complexity, but that charge cannot be leveled against single-name CDS: The risk of a single-name CDS is essentially that of simply buying or selling short a bond. Single-name CDS make up 70 percent of all credit derivatives, according to the BIS. The bulk of CDS trading is in the investment-grade segment of the corporate credit market, although CDS trading involving high-yield names has been expanding quickly. Most recently, CDS that reference asset-backed securities have been a high-growth part of the market. Single-name CDS can be used as building blocks to construct credit derivatives referencing portfolios of issuers. These so-called multiname CDS make up the remaining 30 percent of credit derivatives, according to the BIS. Some multiname CDS are quite straightforward, such as an index of actively-traded names in a particular market segment. Some, however, are indeed quite complex; they include certain structured credit derivatives that unbundle the risk of a portfolio of names into tranches with different seniorities and dramatically different risks.  Credit derivative indexes are currently the fastest-growing and most liquid area of the credit markets. They were created first in the most actively traded market segments: investment-grade and high-yield                                                       1  A CDS provides the purchaser with protection against the cost of defaults or other credit events that reduce the market value of underlying reference obligations (usually bonds or loans). Reference obligations and obligors are known as “names.” BIS Review 28/2007 1 
names in both North America and Europe. Recently, newer indexes have been created in other market segments, including securities backed by commercial mortgages, subprime residential mortgages, and European leveraged loans.2  Among the more complex credit derivatives, the credit index tranches stand out as an important development. A credit index tranche exposes an investor to a particular slice of the losses due to defaults among names in one of the credit derivative indexes. The so-called equity tranche bears a disproportionate share of the total credit risk of the underlying index. For example, an equity tranche might be exposed to the first 3 percent of losses. Other tranches would cover the remaining percentiles of loss, and the sum of all tranches reproduces the exposure of the entire index. As I will discuss in a few minutes, one factor behind the complexity of credit index tranches is that the loss exposure depends not only on the level of defaults but also on the correlation of defaults across issuers. Another instrument in the credit markets, similar to a credit index tranche, is the collateralized debt obligation, or CDO. A CDO pools a portfolio of fixed-income assets into a tranched liability structure that is familiar from other securitization markets. For example, banks have long used a similar liability structure to fund their credit card loans to consumers. The most common types of collateral for CDOs are asset-backed and corporate securities and syndicated loans. CDOs backed by loans are referred to as collateralized loan obligations, or CLOs. The growth of CLOs has certainly had an effect on the market for syndicated loans. Of course, syndicated loans are not a new instrument. They have been around since the 1970s. But recently, the secondary-market liquidity of syndicated loans has improved dramatically, in part because of the demand for loans by CLOs. This improved liquidity has transformed loans from buy-and-hold investments into traded assets. Market participants are now working to standardize documentation for trading credit default swaps referencing loans. These so-called loan CDS have already started to trade in small amounts. The development of these new instruments and markets has been facilitated by nonbank institutional investors and has in turn helped such investors expand their participation in credit markets. Data on participation by nonbank institutional investors are difficult to come by, but such data are available for the syndicated loan markets.3 Historically, loan syndications, which include both loan commitments and term loans, were predominantly funded by banks. But in the period from 2001 through 2006, when the amount of term loans to U.S. nonfinancial corporations rose from $100 billion to more than $350 billion, the nonbank share of such lending rose from less than one-half to roughly two-thirds. The institutional investors in these loans include mutual funds, insurance companies, pension funds, and hedge funds. In the mid-1990s, mutual funds were the most important type of institutional investor in these markets. More recently, identifying the ultimate sources of institutional demand has become more difficult. For example, from 2001 through 2006, about two-thirds of institutional term loans were purchased as collateral for the issuance of CLOs. Although institutional investors undoubtedly are the predominant investors in CLOs, little is known about the holdings of the various types of institutions. Also, while much is being made of the increasingly important role of hedge funds in credit markets, hedge funds, in turn, are increasingly managing assets on behalf of endowments, pension funds, and other institutional investors.4  Asset managers are clearly playing an increasingly important role in credit markets, whether they are managing mutual funds, CLOs, or hedge funds. The decisions of those asset managers are increasingly being driven by the preferences of institutional investors. And the decisions of the asset managers have a large influence on the pricing of credit, even for types of credit whose pricing historically was driven by the decisions of banks.                                                       2  A leveraged loan is commonly defined as a syndicated loan, typically to a riskier borrower, with an interest rate of at least libor plus 125 basis points. 3  Standard and Poor’s Leveraged Commentary and Data, “Leveraged Lending Review,” 2006:Q3. 4  One industry survey forecasts that institutions will account for roughly half of hedge fund inflows in 2007, up from virtually zero in 2000 (“Hedge Funds,” International Financial Services, London, March 2006, p. 3, chart 7). 2 BIS Review 28/2007 
Benefits of recent developments The new instruments, markets, and participants I just described have brought some important benefits to credit markets. I will touch on three of these benefits: enhanced liquidity and transparency, the availability of new tools for managing credit risk, and a greater dispersion of credit risk.  In listing these benefits, I am struck by the strong resemblance of what is happening right now in credit markets to what happened historically in other markets when derivatives were introduced. For example, the markets for agricultural commodities in the United States reaped some of these benefits when standardized futures contracts for wheat and other commodities were introduced in the middle of the nineteenth century.5  Historically, the secondary markets for corporate bonds, loans, and asset-backed securities were illiquid and not transparent. Liquidity in these [msg1] markets has improved over time but is still quite poor. For example, half of outstanding corporate bonds did not even trade once in the first three months of 2006.6 Individual bonds tend to be somewhat liquid immediately after they are issued, but trading activity declines quickly thereafter as investors put the bonds into buy-and-hold portfolios. Also, shorting corporate bonds is very difficult. The dramatic improvement in credit market liquidity has been spurred by credit derivatives. One way to measure the improvement in liquidity is with bid-ask spreads. For investment-grade corporate bonds – a relatively liquid part of the bond market – the bid-ask spread averaged 64 basis points last year.7 The bid-ask spreads for single-name investment-grade CDS, however, are typically only 10 basis points or less, and the usual bid-ask spread for investment-grade credit indexes is just 2 basis points. The liquidity of the secondary market for loans has also improved in recent years. Trading volume totaled $239 billion in 2006, up from $102 billion in 2000.8 A key factor driving the improvement in secondary-market liquidity is the expanded participation of nonbank institutional investors. These investors are active managers of credit risk, and consequently they appear to place a higher value on liquidity.  Along with liquidity, transparency in credit markets has also improved over time. Corporate bond markets are more transparent thanks to a regulatory change that took effect in 2002. Dealers must now report nearly all corporate bond trades to the NASD within fifteen minutes, and the NASD immediately reports the trade data to the market. For asset-backed securities and loans, price transparency is available from specialist vendors who aggregate and disseminate dealers’ prices. For example, in the syndicated loan market, one vendor currently aggregates data from more than seventy traders to price nearly 6,000 loans daily. Prices of many credit derivatives, including single-name CDS, credit derivative indexes, and credit index tranches, are widely available on services such as Bloomberg or Reuters. Complex credit derivatives such as CDO tranches are an exception to all this: They remain largely illiquid and nontransparent. Enhanced liquidity and transparency should promote better risk management by market participants and facilitate broader participation in credit markets. Liquid markets make it easier to access historical price data and thus permit better measurement of credit risks. Measuring a risk more accurately allows it to be priced more accurately. A more transparent market with more accurate pricing is attractive to a wider array of investors. In effect, better liquidity and transparency have lowered the cost of entry into the credit markets. In addition to enhanced liquidity and transparency, the recent developments in credit markets have equipped market participants with new tools for taking on, hedging, and managing credit risk. These new tools allow investors to more easily customize their credit risk portfolios. Investors can now construct a diverse portfolio at much lower transaction costs compared with purchasing a portfolio of corporate bonds or even single-name CDS. As derivatives, indexes can readily be used either to                                                       5  See Randall S. Kroszner (1999), “Can the Financial Markets Privately Regulate Risk?

reduce or to take on more credit risk. In contrast, for corporate bonds, the lack of a well-developed securities lending market makes it difficult to shed credit risk by short selling.  The enhanced transparency and liquidity of credit markets and the development of new instruments for customizing the risk characteristics of credit exposures have resulted in a wider dispersion of credit risk. Although significant participation by nonbank institutional investors has long been a hallmark of U.S. credit markets, these developments have facilitated greater risk-bearing by entities other than banks and other highly regulated depository institutions. On its face, a wider dispersion of credit risk would seem to enhance the stability of the financial system by reducing the likelihood that credit defaults will weaken any one financial institution or class of financial institutions.  Some have expressed concern about the transfer of risk by banks and other heavily regulated depository institutions to more lightly regulated or unregulated entities. Some specific concerns are quite legitimate. For example, as I will discuss in a few moments, if banks transfer credit risk to other entities through mechanisms that expose the banks to counterparty risks to those entities, the transfer is fully effective only if the banks manage those counterparty risks prudently.  However, some other concerns about the transfer of credit risk outside the banking system seem to be based on questionable assumptions. For example, some observers believe that credit risks will be managed more effectively by banks because they generally are more heavily regulated than the entities to which they are transferring credit risk. But those unregulated or less regulated entities should in principle be subject to more-effective market discipline than banks because, without a safety net supporting them, their creditors have stronger incentives to monitor and limit their risk-taking. In fact, while many focus on the dangers of risk transfer to highly leveraged entities that might be vulnerable to a sharp widening of credit spreads, a significant portion of the risks that are being transferred outside the banking system are being transferred to institutional investors that are far less leveraged than banks.  Challenges associated with recent developments The benefits from the development of new instruments and markets that I have described will be fully realized only if market participants address various risk-management challenges posed by the use of these instruments. I will discuss three challenges: limiting counterparty credit risk, modeling default correlation, and improving the infrastructure for clearing and settling credit derivative trades. But before I discuss the risk-management challenges, I want to emphasize that the fundamental risks in credit markets have not been changed by the new instruments that are now being traded. Credit risks may be traded among market participants, but that does not eliminate the risk. Investors in credit markets are still exposed to the risk that issuers may default on their obligations. And in the event of default, investors are still exposed to the further risk that the recovery rate will be lower than expected. The management of default and recovery risks presents nothing fundamentally new to investors. Instruments like single-name CDS and credit derivative indexes simply replicate the sort of credit exposures that have always existed. From the perspective of financial stability, I believe that the most important risk-management challenge in credit markets is the management of counterparty credit risk. I mentioned earlier that institutional investors, including hedge funds, are now more active in credit markets. I also noted that when banks trade credit risk using new instruments such as credit derivatives or CDOs, they must take care to limit any counterparty credit risk that might result.  Banks commonly rely on collateral to mitigate counterparty credit risk on over-the-counter derivatives. Credit derivatives are no exception. Also, banks universally require their hedge fund counterparties to post collateral to cover current exposures and, with some exceptions, to cover potential exposures from future market movements. But given the growing role of hedge funds in credit markets, it is appropriate to ask whether dealer banks have enough collateral to protect them against a stress scenario that goes well beyond the recent benign experience in credit markets.  Default correlation is a distinctly new aspect of credit risk. The value of credit index tranches and CDO tranches is sensitive not only to the number of defaults among a set of issuers but also to the correlation of defaults. The more senior tranches suffer losses only in a scenario with many correlated defaults. The value of these senior tranches falls when default correlation rises. The value of a first-loss tranche rises when default correlation rises. And somewhere in the middle of the capital structure is a tranche whose value is roughly insensitive to correlation. The mathematical relationship between 4 BIS Review 28/2007 
tranche value and correlation depends on the particular model that is used to forecast defaults. This dependency exposes dealers and investors to so-called correlation risk if their models or forecasts of default correlation turn out to be incorrect.  Correlation risk is challenging to measure and manage, and fairly recently some market participants learned a hard lesson about those challenges. In May 2005, a widening of credit spreads for several automotive companies led to sharp movements in the prices of credit index tranches that seemed to catch market participants by surprise. Their models of correlation risk seemed to have lagged behind the development of the new tranched credit products. Since then, much energy has been devoted to building better models of correlation risk, but I believe it is fair to say that much work remains to be done before this risk can be considered to be fully understood. These risk-management challenges have not gone unnoticed by market participants themselves. In 2005, a private-sector group, the Counterparty Risk Management Policy Group II, or CRMPG II, chaired by E. Gerald Corrigan, produced a report highlighting many of these issues.9 That report also made a number of useful recommendations to market participants on how they could address some of the challenges I have mentioned here. It is encouraging to find market participants taking a leading role in making the improvements in risk management that will be needed to fully reap the benefits of innovations in credit markets. The third and final challenge I will discuss is that of infrastructure. The very rapid growth of trading credit derivatives had until recently outpaced the development of the infrastructure necessary to clear and settle those trades. Post-trade processes were largely manual, with attendant inefficiencies and risks. By early 2005, credit derivatives dealers had huge backlogs of unconfirmed trades, even though they had greatly increased their back-office resources. Unconfirmed trades increase the potential for material inaccuracies in trade records, which can cause mismeasurement and mismanagement of market risks and counterparty credit risks. Market infrastructures can be improved only through collective actions by market participants. In 2005, some stimulus for the necessary collective actions was provided by both the private sector and the public sector. CRMPG II called attention to the growing backlogs and the risks that they posed to market participants and called for the convening of an industry roundtable to address them.10 Prudential supervisors then took the lead. In September 2005 they called fourteen leading dealers to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, where the supervisors collectively made clear their concerns about the risks posed by the growing backlogs. The supervisors wisely avoided any temptation to design their own improvements to the market infrastructure. Instead, they simply insisted that the backlogs be reduced and left it to the dealers who had been at the meeting (and who became known as the Fed 14) to figure out with other market participants how best to achieve that objective. The market participants recognized that automation was the key; manual processes simply are not scalable. Both dealers and asset managers embraced use of the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation’s Deriv/Serv electronic confirmation service. The results have been dramatic. Between September 2005 and December 2006, aggregate credit derivatives confirmations outstanding thirty days or more at the fourteen dealers declined 92 percent despite continued rapid growth in trading volumes. With the encouragement and support of supervisors, a larger group of dealers and asset managers are now turning their attention to addressing backlogs in the equity derivatives markets. Conclusions Credit markets undoubtedly will continue to evolve in the years to come. In the short run, rapid change can pose significant challenges to market participants. Cooperative initiatives, such as CRMPG II and the Fed 14, can contribute greatly to ensuring that those challenges are met successfully by identifying effective risk-management practices and by stimulating collective action when it is necessary, notably in achieving improvements in market infrastructures.

Jean-Claude Trichet: Hearing before the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Parliament   Speech by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, at a hearing before the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Parliament, Brussels, 21 March 2007. *      *      * Madame la Présidente, Mesdames et Messieurs les membres de la Commission Economique et Monétaire, c’est avec un intérêt chaque fois renouvelé que je parais, tous les trimestres, devant votre Commission afin de poursuivre le dialogue de la Banque Centrale avec le Parlement. La Banque Centrale Européenne est, vous le savez, très attachée à cet exercice qui contribue à rendre notre action transparente vis-à-vis du citoyen européen. Je commencerai mon intervention par une évaluation de la situation économique et monétaire. Anschließend werde ich auf die Unterschiede, die bei den geldpolitischen Transmissionskanälen in den USA und dem Euroraum bestehen, sowie ihre praktischen Auswirkungen eingehen. Zum Abschluss möchte ich die Bedeutung von Preisstabilität aus sozialpolitischer Perspektive erläutern. Economic and monetary issues Since my previous appearance before the European Parliament in December last year, newly available information has served to confirm our assessment that economic growth in the euro area continues to expand robustly. In addition, the cross-checking of our economic and monetary analyses have underlined the existence of upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. Accordingly, on 8 March the Governing Council of the ECB decided to increase key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. Our decision to increase key ECB interest rates in March contributes to ensuring that medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability, which is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting sustainable economic growth and job creation in the euro area. Let me explain the assessment underlying this decision and the outlook for the economy and risks to price stability. Starting with the economic analysis, according to Eurostat’s first estimate, the quarter-on-quarter growth rate of real GDP in the euro area for the fourth quarter of 2006 was 0.9%, which was above previous expectations. Both domestic demand and exports made significant contributions to this growth, confirming the sustained and broad-based nature of the current expansion. The information on economic activity from various confidence surveys and indicator-based estimates supports the assessment that economic growth has continued into 2007. Looking ahead, conditions remain in place for the euro area economy to grow solidly. Global economic growth has become more balanced across regions and, while moderating somewhat, remains robust, providing support for euro area exports. Domestic demand is expected to maintain its relatively strong momentum. Investment is expected to remain dynamic, benefiting from an extended period of very favourable financing conditions, balance sheet restructuring, accumulated and ongoing strong earnings, and gains in business efficiency. Consumption should also strengthen further over time in line with developments in real disposable income as employment conditions continue to improve. This outlook for economic developments is also reflected in the new ECB staff macroeconomic projections which foresee average annual real GDP growth in a range between 2.1% and 2.9% in 2007 and between 1.9% and 2.9% in 2008. In the Governing Council’s view, the risks surrounding the favourable outlook for economic growth are broadly balanced over the shorter term. At longer horizons, risks lie mainly on the downside, relating to the possibility of a renewed increase in oil prices, fears of a rise in protectionist pressures and concerns about possible disorderly developments owing to global imbalances.  Turning to the price developments, annual HICP inflation was 1.8% in February 2007, unchanged from January 2007. The lower annual HICP inflation rates since the summer of 2006 have been predominantly due to lower energy prices. Looking ahead, last year’s volatility in energy prices will lead to significant base effects, affecting the profile of annual inflation rates this year. Accordingly and on the basis of the current level of oil prices and oil price futures, annual inflation rates are likely to fall during the spring and summer before rising again towards the end of the year and hovering again at BIS Review 27/2007 1 
around 2%. The new ECB staff macroeconomic projections point to annual HICP inflation averaging between 1.5% and 2.1% in 2007 and between 1.4% and 2.6% in 2008.  At the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, the outlook for price developments remains, in the Governing Council’s view, subject to upside risks. These stem from the possibility of renewed oil price increases and additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those announced and decided thus far. More fundamentally, stronger than currently expected wage developments would pose significant upward risks to price stability, particularly in view of the favourable momentum of real GDP growth. It is therefore crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities and that wage agreements take into account present relative price competitiveness positions, the still high level of unemployment in many countries as well as productivity developments. The Governing Council will monitor the upcoming wage negotiations in the euro area countries very carefully. Turning to the monetary analysis, this confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer horizons. Annual M3 growth was unchanged at 9.8% in January, remaining at the highest rate observed since the introduction of the euro. At 10.6%, the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector also remained strong in January. This reflects the continuation of the upward trend in the growth of borrowing by non-financial corporations seen since mid-2004. Meanwhile, the growth of household borrowing has shown some further signs of moderation in recent months, albeit remaining at still high rates.  Taking the appropriate medium to longer-term perspective, the latest developments confirm the continuation of a persistent upward trend in the underlying rate of monetary expansion. Furthermore, following several years of robust monetary growth, the liquidity situation in the euro area is ample by all plausible measures. The robust expansion of money and credit in an environment of ample liquidity points to upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. Monetary developments therefore continue to require very careful monitoring, particularly against the background of a solid expansion in economic activity and continued strong property market developments in many parts of the euro area.  To sum up, in assessing price trends it is important to look through any short term volatility in inflation rates. At the policy-relevant horizon of the medium term, risks to price stability remain on the upside, relating in particular to stronger than currently expected wage developments in a context of robust ongoing growth in employment and economic activity. Given the vigorous monetary and credit growth in an environment of already ample liquidity, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium to longer term.  Monetary policy transmission in the euro area and the US In my remarks today I would also like to discuss differences and similarities in the transmission of monetary policy in the euro area and the US.  Optimal monetary-policy actions depend on the nature of the shocks hitting the economy, the present and future expected economic environment and, importantly, on the transmission mechanisms of monetary policy actions. These elements have a precise bearing on comparative exercises highlighting parallels and differences between monetary policies in different currency areas. For example, in order to compare the monetary policy decisions of the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, we must analyse, among other things, the structure of the economies in which they are operating, because economic structures and institutions determine the functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanisms and, therefore, indirectly influence the design of policy.  Is the monetary transmission mechanism in the United States significantly different from that of the euro area? Applied economics has approached this question from two different angles: statistical and structural analysis.  Statistical analysis has studied the business cycle properties of aggregate data, such as GDP and inflation for the US and the euro area. By applying a battery of statistical tests, this approach seeks to assess whether macroeconomic time series display similar or different dynamic patterns over the cycle in the two areas. A related approach has applied statistical techniques to identify the way in which a monetary policy innovation propagates through the economy.  But statistical analysis is imperfect because it is difficult to see – based solely on aggregate data statistics – whether a difference in statistical patterns originates in shocks or in economic structures, 2 BIS Review 27/2007 
and what feature of the economic structures and institutions is responsible for what particular aspect of the transmission of monetary policy impulses.  Structural analysis has concentrated – more fundamentally – on two related aspects. First, it has constructed measures of price and wage rigidity: these have been expressed by the frequency of price and wage adjustments. In economies with more rigid goods and labour markets – where, for example, labour practices and contractual institutions hamper a prompt transmission of shocks to wages – the macroeconomic adjustment to shocks takes longer to run its course and, more importantly, falls disproportionately on production and employment.  Second, structural analysis has provided evidence of the sensitivity of inflation expectations to past inflation developments. The relevance of inflation expectations to the transmission mechanism is more subtle but central. An inflationary shock tends to be more persistent if wage and price rigidities are greater, unless inflation expectations are found to be insensitive to the inflation history and more solidly anchored around the objective of the central bank. Again, this has important implications for monetary transmission. A shock to inflation is faster to dissipate – even if prices and wages are relatively more rigid – if inflation expectations are more firmly anchored.  Now, while the statistical approach has generally failed to spot significant differences across the two areas, structural analysis comes to two main conclusions. The first is that, in the euro area, prices are distinctly less flexible than in the United States.1  Second, an inflationary shock dissipates quickly in the euro area despite rigidities, and inflation has a tendency to return to its long-run norm reasonably quickly. Survey-based measures of inflation expectations, for example, suggest that the ECB’s influence on expectations seems to have become much stronger since the establishment of the euro.2What are the implications for policy? I will mention two of them, both stemming from the notion that the appropriateness of policy cannot be judged in abstract terms: policy needs to be carefully calibrated to the underlying economic structure.3 First, in a relatively rigid economy, the adjustment falls primarily on quantities. So, a central bank is generally well-advised to avoid volatile policy paths, which in those conditions can transmit unwelcome volatility to the economy and often necessitate corrective, countervailing action further down the road. Second, inflation expectations that look more forward – to the central bank’s intentions – than backward – to inflation history – call for more persistence in the policy direction. Again, a central bank that moves its policy rate around in response to each twist and turn in the data would under these circumstances have only a limited impact on the economy. When the inflation process is as forward-looking as it is in the euro area, policy shifts that lack persistence have little impact on longer-term interest rates, on expectations and – ultimately – on macroeconomic and pricing decisions.  Counterfactual policy evaluation is difficult to conduct and necessarily conditional on a long list of technical assumptions. Nonetheless, recently conducted counterfactual policy-evaluation exercises suggest that since 2001 – and compared with the flexible economy par excellence, the US – our policy interventions had a greater stabilizing effect on the economy. In tune with the structural conditions                                                       1  The Eurosystem has made important contributions to the analysis of price rigidities in the euro area. A summary of a very extensive research project conducted jointly by the ECB and the national central banks is provided in Altissimo, F., M Ehrmann. And F. Smets (2006), “Inflation Persistence and Price Setting in the Euro Area: A Summary of the Inflation Persistence Network Evidence” ECB Occasional Paper 46, Frankfurt am Main: European Central Bank. The paper reports that the average duration of CPI price spells in the euro area is 4.3 quarters. By comparison, M. Bils and P. Klenow, in “Some evidence on the importance of sticky prices”, Journal of Political Economy 112, 2005, calculate that the average duration of CPI prices in the United States is 2.2 quarters. Other Phillips curve-based analyses broadly confirm these results. For the euro area, see J. Gali, M. Gertler and D. Lopez-Salido, “European inflation dynamics”, European Economic Review 45(7), 2001, and J. Gali, M. Gertler and D. Lopez-Salido, “Erratum”, European Economic Review 47(4), 2003. 2  The consumer survey on inflation expectations compiled by the European Commission is a good barometer of the sensitivity of short-term inflation expectations to recent inflation dynamics. Results are presented in terms of the difference between the percentage of respondents who believe prices will increase and the percentage of respondents who believe that they will decrease or stabilise. Prior to the euro cash changeover there was a close relationship between this qualitative indicator and actual inflation developments, with a correlation coefficient near to 1. However, since the cash changeover, the correlation between the two series has dropped to 0.4. 3  Christiano, J., R. Motto and M. Rostagno (2007), “Shocks, Structures or Policies? The Euro Area and the US after 2001” (forthcoming in the Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control) argue along these lines on the basis of a structural estimated model of the euro area and the US. BIS Review 27/2007 3 
prevailing in the euro area, the overall degree of accommodation delivered by the ECB was more ample, albeit back-loaded, because it was more persistent.4  Of course, keeping our interest rate at an unprecedented low level for two years and a half would not have been part of a feasible policy, without consistent signs that expectations were well-anchored and the inflationary shocks that were hitting the economy at the time of the downturn were being quickly reabsorbed.5  Social benefits of price stability  Let me now turn to my last point today in which I would like to emphasise the critical role of our quantitative definition of price stability in orienting expectations. I have mentioned how persistent conditions of price stability can change the transmission channels in ways that can partly alleviate structural shortcomings of the economy. In the euro area, notwithstanding structural rigidities that impede price and wage adjustments – rigidities that cannot be corrected by a central bank – well-anchored inflation expectations partly compensate for and make the transmission mechanism less inefficient than it would be otherwise.  But welfare analysis has also drawn attention to other, and perhaps even more fundamental, channels through which price stability can enhance growth prospects and contribute to the living standards of citizens.  First, in a market economy, the price system plays a key role in the efficient allocation of resources to alternative uses. Price pressures in a specific market can signal profitable investment opportunities to firms. Price stability improves the quality of the signals that prices convey to both households and firms, which can then easily recognise changes in the relative prices of different goods, allowing them to make well-informed consumption and investment decisions. By contrast, in an inflationary environment, prices only provide blurred signals: price increases in a specific market can either indicate strong demand and investment opportunities or simply reflect a general increase in the price level. By helping market forces to guide resources to those uses in which they can be used most productively, price stability contributes to sustainable increases in productivity and employment, and ultimately higher standards of living.  Second, price stability contributes to lower levels of both nominal and real interest rates. Inflation erodes the real value of nominal claims and, in an inflationary environment, lenders typically require an inflation risk premium to compensate them for the inflation risks associated with their investments. By contrast, creditors do not require such a risk premium when price stability is ensured. By reducing inflation risk premia, price stability results in lower levels of real interest rates, thereby making more investment projects profitable. By supporting investment, lower interest rates contribute to higher levels of employment and economic growth. Third, it is well known that inflation acts like a tax on holdings of cash. Inflation increases the price of the transaction services of money. While this certainly is not a palpable economic phenomenon in the euro area today, a handful of hyperinflation episodes in economic history still makes this so-called “inflation tax” one of the most widely known examples of the undesirable consequences of inflation. By setting the “inflation tax” to negligible levels, price stability minimises transaction costs in the economy as a whole. This benefits all citizens on a daily basis, and even more so those who are not in a position to protect themselves against inflation.  Finally, inflation brings about an arbitrary redistribution of income and wealth. The more vulnerable groups in society typically suffer the most from inflation. They have a relatively higher share of their savings invested in cash and savings accounts, the real value of which is easily eroded by inflation. Their limited access to financial markets leave them with little room to evade the “inflation tax”. In this respect, pensioners who have to live on their pension entitlements and savings accumulated during their working life constitute a group that is particularly vulnerable to inflation. Price stability ensures that the real value of both pension entitlements and savings is maintained.                                                        4  The counterfactual is conducted in Christiano, et al (2007), op. cit. 5  See in particular the following speeches (published on the ECB website): J.-C. Trichet, “Monetary policy and credible alertness” (Jackson Hole, 27 August 2005) and “Activism and alertness in monetary policy” (Madrid, 8 June 2006). 4 BIS Review 27/2007 
Today, the level of inflation in the euro area is below the threshold of our definition of price stability, of “less than 2%, close to 2%”, while medium and long-term inflationary expectations in the euro area are solidly anchored. Against this background, the social benefits of price stability are often taken for granted. I should therefore like to stress here that the undesirable social and economic consequences of inflation, namely inefficient allocation of resources, high levels of interest rates, the regressive inflation tax, arbitrary redistribution of income and wealth to the detriment of the most vulnerable, and, last but not least, economic instability, lower growth and lower job creation, are the benchmarks against which one has to assess the social benefits of price stability. This is why a credible commitment to maintaining price stability is so important for the living standards of European citizens. And why our fellow citizens, according to all surveys, are so profoundly attached to price stability.  I thank you for your attention. BIS Review 27/2007 5 
Y V Reddy: Globalisation and monetary policy – some emerging issues Inaugural address by Dr Y V Reddy, Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the conference on “Advances in Open Economy Macroeconomics”, organised by the Center for Economics and Development, Northwestern University, USA and the Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, Mumbai, 19 March 2007. *      *      * Professor Radhakrishna, Professor Eichenbaun, Professor Rebelo, Professor Christiano, Professor Nachane, Dr. Rakesh Mohan and friends, Happy New Year to all of you. For Dr. Rakesh Mohan, it is a holiday issue, as he described. For me, it is a festival issue also, since I am a Telugu. So, my address will be in the form of sharing of the festive mood also. As you may be aware, today is a festival celebrated as New Year by the State of Maharashtra, and is called Gudipadwa by the Marathi-speaking people, who number about 70 million. It is also celebrated by about 65 million Kannada-speaking people as "Ugadi". We, the 80 million Telugu-speaking also celebrate the festival as Ugadi. The festival marks the New Year day for people who follow the southern Indian lunar calendar. This calendar reckons dates based on the Salivahana era (Salivahana Saka), which begins its count from the supposed date of the founding of the Empire by the legendary hero Shalivahana. The Satavahana king Shalivahana (also identified as Gautamiputra Satakarni) is credited with the initiation of this era known as Shalivahana. The Shalivahana era begins its count of years from the year corresponding to 78 AD of the Gregorian calendar. Thus, the year 2000 AD corresponds to the year 1922 of the Salivahana Era. In the terminology used by this lunar calendar, Ugadi falls on Chaitra Sudhdha Paadyami or the first day of the bright half of the Hindu month of Chaitra.  The Telugu and Kannada people celebrate the festival with great fanfare; gatherings of the extended family and a sumptuous feast are de rigueur. The day, however, begins with ritual showers followed by prayers, and then the eating of a specific mixture of Neem Buds/Flowers for Bitterness, Jaggery for Sweetness, Raw Mango for Vagaru , Tamarind Juice for sour. This mixture, called “Ugadi Pachhadi” in Telugu and “Bevu-Bella” in Kannada, symbolizes the fact that life is a mixture of pleasure and pain, which should be accepted together and with equanimity.  People traditionally gather to listen to the recitation of the religious almanac (Panchangam) of the coming year, and to the general forecast of the year to come. This is the Panchanga Sravanam, an informal social function where an elderly and respected person opens the new almanac pertaining to the coming year and makes a general benediction to all present. The advent of radio and television has changed this routine somewhat, especially in the cities. Nowadays, people turn on the radio or TV to watch the recitation.  Ugadi celebrations are also marked by literary discussions, poetry recitations and recognition of authors of literary works through awards and cultural programmes. Recitals of classical carnatic music and dance are held in the evenings. In Maharashtra, it is customary to erect “Gudis” on the first day (Padwa) of the Marathi New Year. “Gudi” is a bamboo staff with a colored silk cloth and a garlanded goblet atop it, which symbolizes victory or achievement. Hence, this day is known as "Gudipadwa" in Maharashtra. The New Year is ushered in with the worship of the “Gudi” and the distribution of a specific “Prasadam” comprising tender neem leaves, gram-pulse and jaggery. The symbolism of tastes is the same as that of Ugadi. It is believed that the creator of the Hindu pantheon Lord Brahma started creation on this day – Chaitra suddha padhyami or the Ugadi day. Also, the great Indian Mathematician Bhaskaracharya’s calculations proclaimed the Ugadi day from the sunrise on as the beginning of the New Year, new month and new day. Let me confess that I am not able to predict for the next year, the future of monetary policy in the open economies in general or opening economies like India, since I am yet to hear "Panchang Sravanam" for the New Year named as "Sarvajeet". There is an interesting reason why I could not hear the authentic Panchang Sravanam. There is a difference of opinion among the top pundits in Andhra Pradesh as to whether Panchang Sravanam should be on the 19th or the 20th March, 2007, and a leading light insisted that it should really be on 20th since "Surya-Grahanam" (solar eclipse) on the BIS Review 27/2007 1 
19th bars "Panchang Sravanam" on that day. So, the Panchang Sravanam is slated for the 20th March at 11 am on Saptagiri official TV channel. So, I understand that the Government of Andhra Pradesh has declared that in addition to today being a holiday, the 20th March would be an optional holiday for those who would choose tomorrow for their festivities.  Friends, the Indians may be argumentative but the Telugus are not only argumentative but love freedom to choose – even their Ugadi festival day, even when based on a reading of celestial stars. In the festive mood that lasts for two days this year for the Telugus, let me wish the deliberations of the conference on "Advances in Open Economy Macroeconomics" a very productive and pleasant time. I recognise that a number of eminent economists from the North Western University and other US universities are participating in the conference and I would like to extend a hearty welcome to them. I congratulate the economists from the IGIDR, the RBI and other Indian universities for their contributions to this conference. Let me extend a personal warm welcome to our guests from other countries – we believe in "Atithi devo bhava". I would like to take this opportunity to share a few thoughts on a possible rethink that may be occurring in regard to globalisation that could affect how the open economies would choose to be – to the extent the public policy has choices. That would lead me to share some of the challenges for conduct of monetary policy, in a world currently less certain of the costs or benefits of globalisation. I am afraid, I may be repeating what I had said in some other fora recently but, I hope to contextualise the presentation. In the recent period, a reassessment of the costs and benefits associated with globalisation seems to be taking place. Domestic structural reforms in the emerging economies are unlocking the pent-up domestic demand and, in turn, enabling a greater realisation of the huge potential for growth. So, what is causing the rethink in both – the developed and the emerging economies?  Firstly, the traditional postulate that the capital flows from the capital-surplus or developed countries to the capital-scarce or developing countries, seems to have been disproved in recent years. The world's largest economy, the United States, currently runs a current account deficit, financed to a substantial extent by capital exports from the emerging market economies. Of course, it can be argued that the so-called “global imbalances” are a reflection of incomplete globalisation. But the fact remains that as long as globalization happens to be incomplete, public policy has to manage the consequential "imbalances". Secondly, in a globalising world, the context in which monetary policy is set, often leads to a confrontation with the impossible trinity – independent monetary policy, open capital account and managed exchange rate. The theory holds that at best, only two out of the three would be feasible. In practice, however, there is a shift in preference away from the corner solution with respect to financial imbalances. Currently, intermediate solutions, which were earlier regarded as “fuzzy”, are now becoming increasingly relevant. Moreover, in recognition of the differences between trade and financial integration – first pointed out by Jagdish Bhagwati – there is less certainty today about the corner solutions than in the past.  Thirdly, at a practical level, the recent experience seems to indicate that globalisation may have had accentuated potential conflicts that can impact the fabric of our societies, particularly, in view of rising corporate profits coupled with a reduction in share of remuneration for the labour. In this regard, I was struck by what Mr. John Micklethwait, Editor-in-Chief of The Economist is reported to have said in an interview, as mentioned in a leading daily yesterday (March 18, 2007). He said this in the context of the process of globalisation: "But as far as globalisation goes, I am worried about one thing: if you look at inequality, particularly in America, the rich have got even richer and the median income has barely budged. What is interesting is that just in the last couple of quarters, you began to see a sign of the wages beginning to rise. What if you have seen in the last ten years is the returns to capital increasing dramatically and returns to labour proportionately going down? What is happening now is that if you have the prospect of a downturn, then inequality will become much bigger issue in the American elections. Around the world it is already a much bigger issue, including in places like Japan. The corporate boss in Japan now is paid 35 times what the median worker is paid. In America, it is 411 times." Fourthly, there are wide-spread concerns about the gaps in international trade rules and regulations, the impasse in multilateral trade negotiations and consequently, a rising number of regional and bilateral trade arrangements.  2 BIS Review 27/2007 
Fifthly, the rapid pace of globalisation in monetary and financial relationships has not been accompanied by an improvement in the international financial architecture. Managing financial crisis remains largely a national responsibility. As the UNCTAD’s Trade and Development Report, 2006 has noted: ‘‘The bulk of adjustment in case of external imbalances is often concentrated on a group of developing and transition economies, despite the fact that the source of such imbalances may occur in the developed world’’ (Overview, p. 38-39). In the wake of these developments, there is a growing expression of heightened sensitivity to the costs associated with globalisation. It is recognised that in the ultimate analysis, public policy has important role in managing the costs and benefits of globalisation. To quote Chairman Bernanke: ‘‘Further progress in global economic integration should not be taken for granted…as in the past, the social and political opposition to openness can be strong… much of it arises because changes in the patterns of production are likely to threaten the livelihoods of some workers and the profits of some firms…The natural reaction of those so affected is to resist change, for example, by seeking the passage of protectionist measures’’ (Jackson Hole, 2006).  In brief, the unfolding path of global economic integration and consequently, preferences for open economies are beset with unknown uncertainties. In this broader setting, let us look at the emerging challenges to monetary policy.  First, considerations relating to maximising output and employment weigh as much upon monetary authorities as maintaining price stability, particularly in the developing countries. The twin-objective is often enshrined in the legal provisions except where inflation targeting is mandated. However, domestic inflation has increasingly become less sensitive to the domestic output gap and potentially more sensitive to the world output gap. Each country may, therefore, take a holistic approach to the trinity of free flows of capital, fixed or managed exchange rates and independent monetary policy. The impossible trinity has to be often managed in the emerging economies and this is ensured by close coordination between monetary and other public policies.  Second, the central banks are often concerned with the stability / variability of inflation rather than the level of prices. However, inflation processes have become highly unclear, amidst these uncertainties; central banks are faced with the need to recognise the importance of inflation perceptions and inflation expectations also, as distinct from inflation indicators. The distinction between inflationary expectations and current inflation perceptions in the context of inflation policy is also worth bearing in mind. Furthermore, often than not, the expected change rather than the actual change in real interest rate, following a change in the policy rate, often drives the actions of the economic agents. In this context, credible communication and creative engagement with the market and economic agents has emerged as the critical channel of monetary transmission. The existence of administered prices in commodities critical to inflation expectations, perceptions or indicators complicates the relationship between prices and monetary policy transmission, though the outcome may be socially desirable.  Third, the presence of administered interest rates, even in segments of a financial system, could hold back appropriate adjustments in real rates as a sequel to changes in the policy rates. The administered interest rates do occur in different forms, instruments and magnitudes but these could be, to some extent, monitored. What is surprising, however, is that the financial market rates could also display somewhat inexplicable impervious behaviour and thereby, act as the source of nominal rigidities in the economy. Sometimes, it is described as a conundrum, or might I say "I do not know"? Fourth, the central banks are now taking baby steps – sometimes more frequent steps and at other times after a long gap, and in both directions – to respond to, what appear to be, ripples rather than huge waves in the sea of economic activity. Further, while what is considered as a “neutral rate” of interest, in the present period, appears to be much lower compared to several years before, the issue is whether the neutral rate in respect of the emerging market economies, which has been coming down in tandem with global rates, will tend to be distinctly higher than in the developed economies. Fifth, if the domestic inflation rate of an economy, however low it may be, is higher than the average inflation rate of its trading partners, it puts pressure on the exchange rate. In this context, the question of simultaneous balance of the internal and external sectors becomes a major issue if the flexibilities in the economy are less than adequate. The conduct of monetary policy inevitably involves a careful judgment on the relative weights assigned to the domestic and the global factors and constant reassessment and rebalancing of these in response to evolving circumstances. Sixth, since external capital flows to emerging economies cannot be easily predicted and can also reverse even in the presence of sound fundamentals, monetary authorities often have to, in BIS Review 27/2007 3 
consultation with the government, make choices in regard to exchange rate and monetary management.  Seventh, financial stability considerations may require the use of monetary policy measures, in conjunction with other prudential measures. Some times, there could be even a trade-off between raising the short-term interest rate and tightening of prudential norms, if the risks are perceived to originate from certain segments of the market. The highly leveraged lending operations in the backdrop of asset-price bubbles might require adjustments in the lending margins and risk-based capital requirements.  Eighth, in terms of financial stability, some new challenges are emerging. The international financial markets are currently dominated by private equity funds like hedge funds, which are largely operating outside the “Know-your-customer”/ “Know-your-investor” (KYC/KYI) norms. Hedge funds have long used arrangements that allow them to execute trades with several dealers but there is now an increasing tendency on their part to consolidate the clearing and settlement of their trades at a single firm, the “prime broker”. Prime brokerage poses some unique challenges for the management of counterparty credit and operational risk. Recent events have reinforced the possible adverse impact of their risks. Further, it is commonly observed at the global level that hedge funds are “opaque” – that is, information about their portfolios is typically limited and infrequently provided. From a policy perspective, transparency to investors is largely an issue of investor protection, but the need for counterparties to have adequate information is a risk-management issue. Finally, there are some uncertainties associated with the settling of trades in newer types of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, particularly credit derivatives. As part of recent financial innovations, the credit-derivative and structured-credit markets have grown rapidly during the past few years, allowing dispersion of credit risk by financial players. As we are aware, the impact of instability in the emerging economies in times of crisis appears to be borne by the home or domestic public sector also, along with the global private sector. Avoiding crisis is ultimately a national responsibility. In such a milieu, the policy makers are often confronted with competing positions and make choices in the face of daunting dilemmas. Concluding remarks Before concluding, it will be remiss of me not to address the relationship between the real and the financial sectors in the context of globalisation, open economies and macro finance. Economists have for long recognised the strong complementarities between the real and the financial sectors. Financial development contributes to growth in either a supply-leading or a demand-following sequence; that is, either the financial sector development creates the conditions for growth or the growth generates demand for the financial services. It is important to recognise that the financial sector in India is no longer a constraint on growth and its strength and resilience are acknowledged, though further improvements need to take place. On the other hand, without the real sector development in terms of the physical infrastructure and improvement in supply elasticities, the financial sector can even misallocate resources, potentially generate bubbles and possibly amplify the risks. Hence, public policy may have a crucial role to play in ensuring balanced reforms in both the real and the financial sectors. The criticality for the policy makers is not only to ensure that there are no financial sector constraints on the real sector activity but also to assure that the financial sector reforms have complementarity with the pace and process of reforms in the real sector in India, along with, no doubt, fiscal empowerment – as consistently emphasised by the Reserve Bank.  Let me conclude by complimenting all those who have devoted their energies to bring to fruition this innovative collaborative academic activity with policy significance for the Reserve Bank of India. I am thankful to the organizers, specially Prof. Nachane for giving me this opportunity to be with you.  We, in the RBI, look forward to the benefit of discussions in this conference. Let me wish the conference all success, and, with success, hopefully many happy returns. Thank you.  4 BIS Review 27/2007 
Erkki Liikanen: CashSSP – the cash single shared platform Remarks by Mr Erkki Liikanen, Governor of the Bank of Finland, on the occasion of signing the Cash Single Shared Platform agreement between the Bank of Finland and the central banks of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, Bank of Finland, Helsinki, 16 March 2007. *      *      * We are here today to witness what could be considered a historic event. The governors of two central banks will in some minutes sign an agreement, by which the Bank of Finland becomes a partner of the group using a joint information system for central bank cash management – CashSSP – the cash single shared platform.  I am glad that José Manuel González-Páramo, a Member of the Executive Board of the ECB responsible for the banknotes directorate, was able to join this important event, together with our Belgian guests and partners. I know that also my colleagues from the Bank of Finland appreciate the presence of you all.  As we all know, CashSSP is a product originally developed years ago by the National Bank of Belgium to manage its own and the country's cash handling requirements. Over the years, the product has been updated and today it is capable of meeting the broad range of requirements that are placed on such systems.  The Benelux countries enjoy a tradition of strong and long-standing cooperation, on top of which, they have always been known for their progressive thinking and open approach to change. It is therefore completely natural that, when it came time to consider modernising their own systems, they first looked to their closest neighbours. This was also the case when introduction and development of the Eurosystem brought with it pressures to change the respective national information systems for cash handling, for example. The Netherlands and Luxembourg were natural partners for Belgium – both already users of CashSSP.  How then did the Bank of Finland come in on the project? We have in place information systems which we ourselves have set up to meet our currency supply needs, and which – both technically and functionally – are becoming outdated. Almost two years ago, planning started to replace the systems with new ones, and we were already reaching the point where a project plan to build a new system was ready, only formal approval was pending.  At the same time, however, we received information on the Belgian system and their willingness to offer the system to other euro area central banks. We took up the matter with the NBB, and it soon appeared that CashSSP, as it had already been expressively named, would also suit the Bank of Finland's needs. For us, the key selection criteria were:  • It enables the streamlining of work flows in the best and most economically sensible way, by making widespread use of modern bar code techniques, for instance.  • It reduces the need for our own resource input in IT by offering an almost fully-fledged system as well as the equipment to run the system.  • It supports harmonisation of the Eurosystem's cash distribution function towards a Single Euro Cash Area.  • It is in line with the Eurosystem's mission, strategic objectives and organisational principles.  Having decided to join the CashSSP, negotiations were commenced on the necessary agreements, pricing policy and a more detailed operational framework. It is clear, that when trying to find the common denominator in information technology, business options and in sharing costs and benefits, negotiations are not necessarily simple or easy.  In the course of the process, our cooperation partners have, however, shown understanding for the questions we have raised, and the negotiations have taken place in a very constructive and fruitful atmosphere; as an expression of these efforts we are now here to sign the agreement, and the Bank of Finland's CashSSP project can be formally launched. At the practical level, we have already been preparing this project for a long time.  BIS Review 26/2007 1 
Despite a comprehensive cooperation agreement, the success of CashSSP will be based on confidence between all parties involved and on the quality of ongoing cooperation. The parties are committed to help each other to the best of their ability. An excellent example of this is the assistance that the NBB is already providing to us in the form of system installation and user training.  In a broader context, cooperation by National Central Banks in the CashSSP project is a significant case of the new, truly European approach to central bank operations, which is evolving within the Eurosystem. Member NCB's are now looking for ways to deepen their cooperation in a flexible and creative manner, developing areas of specialisation on the basis of their relative strengths.  This is, without doubt, a welcome development. According to the Organisational Principles of the Eurosystem, as adopted by the Governing Council, "potential synergies and economies of scale shall be identified and exploited to the extent feasible", and "the Eurosystem shall energetically pursue organisational options that ensure effectiveness, efficiency and prompt action".  Developing our division of labour is especially important, as the Eurosystem needs to improve its cost efficiency to a significant degree. Many activities have large fixed costs and thus delegating them to some central banks avoids duplication of these costs. This kind of pooling is actually one of the most promising ways of pursuing the efficiency goals set out in the Organisational Principles.  For these reasons, the Bank of Finland takes a very positive attitude to this drive for efficiency through deeper cooperation. However, some conditions for further progress in the field should still be borne in mind.  In particular, governance and accounting systems must be built very carefully for each "pooling" arrangement, ensuring that costs and benefits are adequately measured and shared, and that users can get sufficient control of how the pooled services are produced and developed. This is, of course, necessary for the kind of trust required for the delegation of tasks. It is also in conformity with our Organisational Principles which emphasize the values of transparency and accountability.  Secondly, we expect that all Eurosystem central banks can and will participate in the emerging division of labour on the basis of reasonable reciprocity. This reciprocity also conforms nicely with the Organizational Principles, according to which "all members of the Eurosystem shall contribute strategically and operationally to the goals of the system".  The Bank of Finland for its part – as with other NCB's – actively analyses its relative strengths and considers its capacity to participate in the emerging division of labour in a balanced way; not only as a user of pooled services, but also as a service provider. So I expect that our willingness to participate in future pooling schemes will be in some proportion to our prospects of hosting some of the services, where we feel we can usefully contribute.  However, I expect that the conditions which I have mentioned here will not prove any great obstacles for progress in the important further deepening of operational cooperation within the Eurosystem. Good governance models for pooling schemes will be developed – perhaps along the lines marked by the CashSSP project – and NCB's will find their niches, in which they can make their strongest contribution to the success and efficiency of the system as a whole.  To finish, let me again congratulate all those who have worked in order to make this cooperation agreement possible and also express my appreciation of the National Bank of Belgium for its very useful and innovative work. Thank you.  2 BIS Review 26/2007 
Amando M Tetangco, Jr: Migration, remittances, economic development and the role of banks Remarks by Mr Amando M Tetangco, Jr, Governor of the Central Bank of the Philippines (Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas), at the 13th Meeting of the World Savings Bank Institute Asia-Pacific Regional Group, Manila, 15 March 2007. *      *      * Distinguished organizers led by Mr. Jose Antonio Olavarrieta Arcos of the World Savings Bank Institute, WSBI Asia Pacific Group President Mr. Asvinvichit, Mr. De Noose, Chairman of the Management Committee, Undersecretary Jun Paul of the Department of Finance, guests and participants to the 13th Meeting of the WSBI Asia-Pacific Regional Group, good morning and to our foreign guest, welcome to the Philippines!  I must say that the decision of WSBI to hold this year’s meeting in our country is most timely indeed, given the conference theme “Economic Development and Migration: A new Challenge for Savings Banks.” I therefore congratulate the Philippine Postal Savings Bank headed by its Chairman, Justice Lapeña, and its President & CEO Rolando Macasaet for taking the lead in hosting this event.  Indeed, migration and remittances are significant factors in our economy.  According to the World Bank, the Philippines ranks fifth globally in terms of remittances received from its overseas workers. The World Bank report was based on 2004 figures, with India reported to have received $22 billion, China $21 billion, Mexico $18 billion, France $13 billion and the Philippines $10 billion.  Latest available data from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas indicate that in 2006, remittances of overseas Filipino workers coursed through banks reached a record high level of $12.8 billion. Another $1.2 billion was estimated to have been remitted through informal channels. The total amount is equivalent to 10.9% of our Gross Domestic Product! This is a huge resource that offers a lot of opportunities. The increase is due mainly to higher deployment of Filipino workers, abroad more and more in the skilled and professional categories, and a more aggressive campaign to encourage a greater number of overseas workers to channel their remittances through our banking system.  To our banking sector in general and savings banks in particular, remittances averaging $1 billion a month from our 8 million overseas Filipinos represent tremendous opportunities.  As of Sept 2006, for instance, the country’s 85 thrift banks had total deposits of roughly $6.1 billion, up 19.8% from the year ago level. This is about 15% of consolidated deposits of the banking sector. If our savings bank can capture more deposits, it will have more funds for lending, and have better opportunities to improve its profitability.  The first challenge for our banks, therefore, is to find innovative and more cost-efficient ways to provide financial services as well as to expand their network and upgrade their infrastructure to reach an even greater number of our workers and their beneficiaries.  Most of our workers’ remittances come from the United States, Saudi Arabia, Canada, Italy, the United Kingdom, Japan, the United Arab Emirates, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan. So far, so good. Banks and non-bank remittance companies have been heeding our challenge to have faster, safer and more efficient remittance delivery. In fact, the Philippines is credited to have launched one of the world’s first mobile phone-based remittance service.  Specifically, we now have improved platform for remittances through the adoption of advanced systems and new technologies such as internet/on-line banking, phone banking and through short messaging.  Furthermore, we now have enhanced and expanded financial products and services including bills payment arrangements, international money/cash cards, remittance network expansion, as well as new correspondent remittance agreements with host countries.  To promote the efficient delivery of competitively-priced remittance services by banks and other remittance service providers, the BSP issued a circular requiring banks and non-bank financial BIS Review 26/2007 1 
institutions to post the charges for their various remittance products, including classification of costs. This disclosure requirement also provides the necessary information for the worker or his/her beneficiary to make a more informed decision in bank selection. The OFWs as bank clients also benefited from the improvements in the country’s payments and settlement systems, such as the full interconnection of the three major automated teller machine (ATM) networks; and the continuing approval by the Bangko Sentral of alternative mechanisms for sending money, such as SMS-based applications for remittances. The interconnection of the three networks facilitates greater accessibility as more ATMs can now serve the withdrawal needs of depositors. More importantly, it reduces the cost of transactions since it eliminated fees associated with the use of international “switch” to connect the three networks.  Moving forward, our goal is to have further improvements so that we will have a remittance system based on transparency, efficiency, security and fair prices.  The second challenge for our banks is to help in the national effort to encourage overseas workers and their beneficiaries to channel a higher percentage of their money to deposits and other productive activities possibly linking this to microfinance and small enterprise lending. As other speakers mentioned earlier, there is a full range of banking services that can be offered to overseas workers and their families.  In line with its ongoing advocacy programs, the Bangko Sentral is undertaking a nationwide financial literacy campaign to help channel remittances to development activities and to promote a culture of saving among OFWs and their families. The financial literacy program emphasizes the importance of savings and introduces the participants to alternative opportunities for their remittances, such as placements in financial instruments and investments in business ventures.  In summary, the Philippine central bank’s initiatives to further improve the environment for overseas Filipino workers’ (OFWs) remittance flows will continue to be anchored on five principles, namely:  1. enhancing transparency and promoting competition in the remittance market to lower remittance charges;  2. improving the country’s payments and settlement systems to facilitate faster, safer and more efficient transfer of funds to beneficiaries;  3. improving access to financial services;  4. encouraging OFWs and their families to increase savings and investments; and  5. promoting advocacy programs to cultivate financial literacy among OFWs and their families.  Ladies and gentlemen. The BSP recognizes the valuable contribution of OFWs in expanding the foreign exchange available for meeting the economy’s requirements, as well as the efforts of institutions that help improve the remittance environment, including remitting banks, private remittance companies, and other government agencies. We are therefore looking forward to a fruitful exchange in this meeting of the WSBI to help us provide better, faster and more cost-efficient services to our overseas workers who have helped empower our countries to grow at a healthy rate, on a more sustained basis.  May you have a successful conference and a happy stay in our country. Thank you all and Mabuhay!  2 BIS Review 26/2007 
Xiang Junbo: Pushing forward the construction of a harmonious socialist society through developing a financial system for the disadvantaged Speech by Mr Xiang Junbo, Deputy Governor of the People’s Bank of China, at the “2006 China Financial Forum”, Beijing, 26 December 2006. *      *      * Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen: I’m very pleased to attend the 2006 China Financial Forum jointly held by China Society for Finance and Banking and Financial News. This forum takes the theme of “A harmonious society – the social responsibility of China’s financial sector”, which is of great significance, because this theme not only reflects the characteristics of our times, but also aligns itself with the objective of constructing a socialist harmonious society, highlighting a very practical question facing the financial sector in China, i.e., what role the financial sector can play and what social responsibilities it should take as the core in the modern economy. It is fair to say that each of us as financial practitioners, especially those in leading positions, must take this issue seriously. Not long ago, I published an article entitled “Push forward the construction of a harmonious socialist society through developing a financial system for the disadvantaged”. Today, I’d like to take this opportunity to talk about the background against which this concept is put forward, the definition of the financial system for the disadvantaged, and its key aspects.  1.  Background of the concept  As is known to all, in a modern society, finance and the economy are interdependent. Since China’s reform and opening-up, the economy has been growing at a stable and fast pace. While our overall national strength keeps improving, some deep-rooted problems have emerged and accumulated, leading to structural imbalances in the economy and society, which is reflected in the uneven development among regions, between rural and urban areas, and among industrial sectors. One of the direct outcomes of the “three imbalances” is an emerging and growing group of disadvantaged regions, sectors and people. The support and involvement of the financial system is one of the important factors defining the development of this disadvantaged group. The financial sector has made great endeavors and undertaken some pilot programs in this area, in particular in supporting the development of the central and western China, the development of agriculture, rural areas and farmers, reemployment of laid-off workers, poverty reduction initiatives and student loans. We’ve put forward theories, carried out trials, and gained experiences, both positive and negative. But in general, the theories, practice and experiences are driven by isolated events instead of a systematic plan. There is no theoretical conclusion made from the strategic perspective of constructing a harmonious socialist society, and no practice under the guidance thereof. Because of the absence of a systematic financial theory, institutional and policy system to guide and push ahead the construction of a harmonious society, it is difficult to display the synergy of the entire financial sector in this cause. In the new century, especially since the 16th CPC National Congress, we have clarified the strategic importance of building a socialist harmonious society for the socialist society construction drive. In addition, the just concluded 6th plenary session of the 16th CPC National Congress adopted the Decisions on Major Issues Concerning the Construction of a Harmonious Socialist Society. As the center of the modern economy, finance should and is able to play an important role in the construction of a socialist harmonious society. So far, the financial sector has not fully adapted to the endeavors to build a harmonious socialist society. We need to make major breakthroughs in financial reform in the future. One of the major tasks is to conduct theoretical analysis on how to utilize the financial sector to support the building of a harmonious socialist society, and find a way for the sector to do so.. Since structural imbalance is a major strain, finance should make its due contribution to solving the structural imbalances. To be specific, the financial sector should move away from the concept of “favoring the rich over the poor”, and provide, based on the market principle, necessary support to industrial sectors, regions and groups that are short of funding and lag behind in economic and social development. This is not only a requirement for the financial sector to support the harmonious economic development, but also a responsibility. As such, I believe it necessary to put forward the BIS Review 26/2007 1 
concept of “developing the financial system for the disadvantaged” to fully display the functions of the financial sector in the construction of a harmonious socialist society. 2.  Definition of the concept  “Finance for the disadvantaged” refers to the financing activities for the underdeveloped areas and groups. So far in China, it is meant to be the support rendered to the disadvantaged sectors with agriculture as the primary one, less-developed regions mainly in central and western China, and disadvantaged groups of farmers and laid-off workers in urban areas. It is fair to say that finance for the disadvantaged represents a revision to traditional finance that seeks immediate return. Generally speaking, in countries with immature financial systems, the opportunities are only available to a small group of the population with certain capital accumulation, while those short of capital accumulation are deprived of development opportunities, and subsequently of the benefits from economic growth. However, for a mature financial system with various financial institutions and appropriate institutional arrangement, it is possible to give financial support to those people or regions lack of capital accumulation but equipped with productive skills or resources in one way or another, so that they have opportunities to grow and develop. Therefore, while conforming to the principle of efficiency in the market economy, finance allocates resources to backward regions and industrial sectors, and helps improve the welfare of disadvantaged groups, make them benefit from economic growth and promote a harmonious society. Internationally, there are two types of financial support to disadvantaged industrial sectors, people and regions, namely direct government involvement and indirect policy guidance by the government. Direct government involvement means that the government establishes policy financial institutions to lend to disadvantaged industrial sectors and regions, while policy guidance means that the government adopts preferential policies to guide the market to increase input to the disadvantaged. Policy support is an important feature of finance for the disadvantaged. However, finance for the disadvantaged is more than policy financial activities, it is a relatively complete financial system that includes commercial, cooperative and charity financial activities,. Specific forms of finance for the disadvantaged varies from country to country. Generally speaking, a relatively complete financial system for the disadvantaged at least includes three aspects: financial institutions, a legal system and policy supports..  First, there is a full spectrum of financial institutions that provide finance for the disadvantaged. A lot of countries have put in place a well-developed system, including government-backed financial institutions, private partners, commercial institutions and private lending institutions. They interact with and complement each other to support the development of backward regions, industrial sectors and disadvantaged groups. For example, as far as support for agricultural development is concerned, in the US there are government-backed agricultural lending institutions, farmers cooperative financial institutions, commercial financial institutions and private lending institutions; in Japan, the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Finance Corporation acts as the policy financial institution, and Japan Agricultural Cooperatives as cooperative financial institutions; in India, cooperative agricultural lending institutions, policy financial institutions and commercial banks work together to support the agricultural development; in addition, in over 40 countries governments have established agricultural insurance scheme to conduct agricultural insurance business. To support development in backward regions, various countries have applied policy finance, development finance, and other supportive measures. So far, there are over 750 financial institutions (40% of which are in Latin America) working for the sole purpose of developing backward regions. Almost every African country has set up a bank for regional development. To support disadvantaged groups, over 150 countries have pension insurance institutions, and half of all the countries in the world have established policy medical insurance institutions. Furthermore, many countries have student loan schemes in various forms, which have played an important role in promoting economic development and social stability. Second, a legal system governing finance for the disadvantaged. Most countries regulate financial institutions through a fully-fledged legal framework, and strictly separate financial legislations and regulations into those regulating commercial finance and those targeting policy and cooperative finance, so that the latter group of financial institutions has their own laws and are free from intervention. Thus, they are able to serve agriculture, rural areas, disadvantaged industrial sectors and groups better. Many countries have promulgated special laws to emphasize the importance of the finance for the disadvantaged, such as Federal Agricultural Loan Act, Agricultural Credit Union Act, and Community Investment Statute in the US, Law on Japanese Development Banks, Law on Japan 2 BIS Review 26/2007 
Scholarship Society in Japan, KfW-Gesetz (Law on KfW Development Bank) in Germany, Law on Korean Development Bank, Law on Long-term Credit Bank of Korea in South Korea, Act on Agricultural Intermediary Credit and Development Companies in India, etc. These laws are gradually improved to support and safeguard the development of financial institutions for disadvantaged regions, industrial sectors and groups.  Third, a system of supportive policies. Investment in less-developed regions disadvantaged industrial sectors and disadvantaged groups has lower efficiency, diminishing returns, and high risks; therefore, it is very unlikely to secure capital investment if completely market-oriented. As such, a lot of countries provide preferential policies, such as capital infusion in development financial institutions, guarantee, tax holiday, interest subsidy, etc. For example, the German government guarantees all the liabilities of KfW incurred in supporting the development of disadvantaged industrial sectors and regions, grants it special treatments such as tax exemption and zero dividend payout to shareholders, and allows all profits to be used to increase capital. Japan Development Bank is exempted from all local tax, state tax and corporate tax. The Korean government guarantees the principal and interest payment of financial bonds issued by Korean Development Bank’s to support development of disadvantaged industries. The US federal government provides credit guarantee to private financial institutions that give credit to backward regions. In building the railway network in western states, the federal government granted various favorable financial policies to railway companies to boost their financing capabilities.  3.  The focus in developing the finance for the disadvantaged in China  We have made some progress in developing the financial system for the disadvantaged, but there is a lot to do compared with that in developed countries and in order to build a harmonious socialist society. In my opinion, we should make efforts in the following three key aspects to in order to develop a financial system for the disadvantaged.  First, new measures should be taken to create a financial system for the disadvantaged. Since reform, some financial institutions have been established for the disadvantaged in China, but there are not fully fledged. For example, there are structural and operational problems in the rural financial institutions, such as extensive operational mode, weak management, low profitability, yet-to-be improved staff quality, and high risks associated with rural credit cooperatives; the Agricultural Bank of China has not fully functioned as a major player in commercial finance for farmers and rural economy; the risk compensation, sharing and transferring mechanism is not sound for policy agricultural loans, guarantee mechanism in rural areas and agricultural insurance are yet to be developed. There are not enough innovations of financial institutions and supportive policies to meet the needs of farmers’ productive activities and livelihood. Generally speaking, there is room for improvement in the financial system for the disadvantaged, which should not only include traditional financial institutions, such as policy, development, commercial and cooperative financial institutions, but also include innovative financial institutions such as venture capital investment, guarantee, insurance, leasing, micro-credit financial institutions. Endeavors should be made to create a system in which various types of financial institutions coexist, complement and compete with each other, each with well-defined functions and responsibilities to satisfy the demand of disadvantaged industrial sectors, groups and backward regions for financial services. It is worth mentioning that, micro finance, as a new measure of poverty reduction, has evolved from the micro loans for farmers in the 1970s, to micro-credit for micro-businesses in the 1980s, and finance that seeks commercial viability and loan coverage. It has become an important part in the financial system for the disadvantaged. We have made some trials in micro finance in the past, and in the future, we will explore a development mode with multiple players in line with the Chinese situation by drawing on positive and negative experiences in other countries, so that micro finance can truly and effectively support the majority of disadvantaged.  Second, progress should be made in creating a legal system for finance for the disadvantaged. The finance for the disadvantaged is part of the financial system, so it carries the features and conforms to the general principles of the financial system on the one hand; while on the other, its development follows certain special rules. Thus, it is necessary to strengthen the legal system for finance for the disadvantaged. The first is to strengthen legislation for policy finance. From the international perspective, the primary principle here is a separate law for each type of policy financial institutions. Policy banks in China do not have its own legal framework; instead, they are regulated with reference to the laws and regulations governing commercial banks. This not only hinders the smooth operation of policy banks, but also affects how they position themselves. Therefore, we must actively explore BIS Review 26/2007 3 
independent legislation for policy financial institutions. Administrative regulations may be promulgated before they gradually become laws. Second, strengthen regulation and guide of informal finance. Informal finance, as a complement to formal finance, plays a role in boosting economic activities in rural areas and poor regions and promoting regional economic development to some extent. However, due to absence of laws and regulations, it contains a lot of hidden risks. In recent years, informal finance’s positive role is increasingly recognized, but the legal framework is not being developed at the same time. Therefore, laws and regulations should be created and improved to protect legitimate informal financial activities and crack down on loan sharks, underground banks, illegal fundraising and other illegal activities. Third, adopt new measures in policy support to finance for the disadvantaged. Policy guidance and support from the government is common in developing finance for the disadvantaged. Government support should be multifaceted and mutually reinforcing, including legal, economic and administrative measures, both direct and indirect. As mentioned earlier, from the inception and development of finance for the disadvantaged in various countries, we can see that government support has played a central role. Finance for the disadvantaged is based on the effective combination of government credit and market credit, and reflect the synergy of government support and market performance. To be more specific, firstly, the government should provide reliable source of capital for specialized financial institutions, and provide guarantee for their policy lending to ensure sustainability of operations. Second, emphasis should be laid upon coordination between fiscal and financial policies, reflected in tax breaks and fiscal subsidies to relevant financial institutions and activities, and in close cooperation between fiscal and financial departments. Third, more transfer payment should go to disadvantaged groups, industrial sectors and backward regions in the form of agricultural insurance, unemployment insurance and minimum subsistence, to support their risk management and debt servicing capability. These are my personal opinions toward the financial system for the disadvantaged, some food for thought. Hope they will provoke further research in this area, and hopefully more practice to make the financial sector more socially responsible in building a harmonious society. I’m open to questions and challenges. Thank you! 4 BIS Review 26/2007 
Emmanuel Tumusiime-Mutebile: Business continuity and risk management in African central banks Speech by Mr Emmanuel Tumusiime-Mutebile, Governor of Bank of the Uganda, at the closing of the Regional Workshop on Business Continuity and Risk Management, Entebbe, 9 February 2007. *      *      * It is my pleasure to join you as you wind up this workshop. I also wish to appreciate the support provided to this workshop by the Bank of England and Deutsche Bundesbank through the experts they sent to guide deliberations. In the same way I would like to thank Governors of Central banks of Kenya, Tanzania and Reserve Bank of Malawi for honouring my invitation to send representatives to attend this workshop. As the Deputy Governor indicated at the opening ceremony, the BOU considered this workshop as extremely important given the roles our Central Banks are playing on a day-to-day basis in macroeconomic management and financial stability of our region. From the reports we receive at the EAC Monetary Affairs Committee meetings, all the central banks represented in this workshop are at different phases of implementing business continuity and risk management programmes. For the Bank of Uganda, we have implemented our Business continuity program for the last three years while a formal risk management program has now run for slightly over two years. This workshop therefore has presented us with an opportunity to initiate reviews and improvements for resilient business continuity and risk management programs in each of our central banks. I hope that the joint training programme has contributed to further networking on the numerous issues that you handle. Within the context of the East African Community’s set goal to create a single monetary union for the East African region, the three central banks in East Africa have spent significant amount of resources to lay the groundwork for the eventual monetary and political union. Central Banks have been engaged in efforts to harmonise policies, practices and processes to ensure smooth integration. Business continuity, risk management and IT governance are some of the areas, which have been highlighted as key in addressing such a harmonisation process. In business continuity sphere today, a lot of debate has shifted to the possibility of extending business continuity sites beyond territorial boundaries. It is possible that with common approaches and practices discussed in this workshop, our central banks can at some stage act as backup to each other and hence help business recovery efforts in the event of business disruptions. As we come to the end of the workshop, it is my hope and belief that the outcomes of the workshop will be an invaluable contribution to the ongoing efforts to establish sound programs for the management of risks and business continuity. I hope that this workshop has provided the needed opportunity to re-assess and evaluate our performance in the areas of business continuity and risk management. On behalf of Bank of Uganda I would like once again to thank Bank of England and Bundesbank for providing support to this workshop and to thank all the delegates for their participation. It is now my duty to declare this workshop officially closed. BIS Review 25/2007 1 
Alan Bollard: Easy money – global liquidity and its impact on New Zealand Speech by Dr Alan Bollard, Governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, to the Wellington Chamber of Commerce, Wellington, 15 March 2007. *      *      * 1.  What has been happening to global liquidity? Globalisation has had major effects on the New Zealand economy over the last decade or two. Monetary policy has certainly not been immune. Some of the impact has been very helpful to us in our primary task of achieving price stability. We have enjoyed a useful disinflationary impact from the flood of cheap manufactures available from China and other newly industrialising countries. We have enjoyed the benefits of trading with a buoyant world that has been enjoying good stable growth rates with stable prices. More recently however, we have had to focus on a related phenomenon which has had some unanticipated effects: the growth of global liquidity. Global liquidity has increased dramatically over recent years. In our part of the world, this reflects:  • a surplus of savings relative to investment in the East Asian and oil-exporting countries;  • new players, new products, new transactions and markets; and in particular  • the impact of the “carry trade” fuelling investment flows into a range of markets. A feature of the period of relatively strong growth in the world economy over the past several years has been large and growing financial imbalances among the world’s major economies. The US current account deficit has increased significantly over this period, although it has stabilised over the past year relative to the size of the US economy. Meanwhile, most East Asian countries have consistently run current account surpluses since recovering from the 1997/98 financial crisis, when many experienced deficits. More recently, the rise in oil prices has underpinned a substantial increase in the surpluses of the oil exporting nations. Figure 1: Current account balances  Source: IMF World Economic Outlook, September 2006; RBNZ BIS Review 25/2007 1 
These relative current account positions broadly reflect the contrasting balances between saving and investment in these countries. In the case of the deficit countries – such as the US, Australia and New Zealand – investment has exceeded saving, with the excess savings of surplus countries financing the shortfall. Excess savings relative to investment amongst the surplus countries has increased substantially since the late 1990s, led by Asia, a range of developing countries and more recently the oil exporters. This has given rise to a phenomenon that US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has referred to as a “global savings glut”.1  Figure 2: Gross saving and investment  Source: IMF World Economic Outlook, September 2006; Economics@ANZ For many of these countries – particularly the developing economies – this represents a considerably different set of circumstances to that existing prior to the late 1990s, when developing economies (including many of those in Asia) were net recipients of capital. In the case of the developing economies in Asia, the response to the 1997/98 financial crisis has been to focus on export-driven growth and the associated accumulation of foreign exchange reserves – a strategy that most are continuing to pursue almost a decade after the crisis. The strength of exports relative to domestic demand has seen saving outstrip investment in most of these economies – even in the case of China, where investment growth has been very strong. Accordingly, we have the ironic situation whereby a range of developing countries are (in net terms) the providers of capital to some of the world’s most developed economies. This rapidly rising “savings glut” has been a principal source of increased global liquidity.                                                       1  “The Global Saving Glut and the US Current Account Deficit”, March 2005 2 BIS Review 25/2007 
Figure 3: Capital flows to developing economies  Source: IMF World Economic Outlook, September 2006; Economics@ANZ 2.  How is this being recycled? Along with financial deregulation and the general opening up of economies, the flow of increased global liquidity through markets has provided the impetus for many changes. In a recent speech2, Malcolm Knight, General Manager of the Bank for International Settlements, highlighted a number of important new features:  • the unbundling and re-pricing of risk through major advances in financial engineering, resulting in improved ability to lever lending via new markets such as for credit transfer products;  • the emergence of new financial players such as hedge funds and private equity firms that have not been traditional intermediaries;  • more reliance of financial firms on markets to handle growing complexity;  • a reliance on market liquidity even in stress situations; and  • a surge in volume and value of transactions. The search for means to generate a return on this liquidity has spurred massive growth in securitisation of debt and the development of a vast array of derivatives. The propagation of these instruments can itself be seen as a source of liquidity growth and, by some estimates, a substantial one at that. From a monetary policy perspective, this implies a very big increase in the liquidity that is not directly controlled by central banks.                                                       2  “Now you see it, now you don’t: risk in the small and in the large”, February 2007 BIS Review 25/2007 3 
Figure 4: Estimates of global liquidity  Source: Independent Strategy A particular development of interest to us has been the increasing integration of housing finance into these liquid international markets. A recent article in the Financial Times3 reports on a significant slice of new mortgages in Hungary being issued in Swiss francs while households in Latvia and Romania are borrowing in yen. The article then goes on to focus on what they see as one of the biggest flows, the bonds denominated in NZ dollars by European and Asian issuers. 3.  What are the global effects of this liquidity? The flows associated with the growth of global liquidity has played a role in helping to prolong the period of strong global growth seen in recent years. The associated search for yield has pushed down interest rates, bid up equity prices and generally put downward pressure on returns across a range of asset classes.  Many of these effects have been clearly welfare-enhancing. But in contrast to how markets might have reacted a decade ago, it has also allowed less disciplined economic behaviour by some households and firms. It has allowed global imbalances, particularly those associated with the contrasting current account positions of the major economies, to build up and persist beyond what might have previously been considered sustainable. It has meant that when large economies operate with distortions in their own markets, those distortions can be felt halfway around the world. Risk appetites in global financial markets have generally been very strong in recent years. This perhaps reflects the extended period of relatively strong growth in the world economy underpinning investor confidence. This confidence has been bolstered by generally low market volatility, which has also lowered perceptions of risk.                                                        3  “Why the yen borrowing game could end in players taking a tumble”, 14 February 2007 4 BIS Review 25/2007 
Figure 5: Risk aversion and market volatility  Source: Bloomberg; DataStream Perceptions of a relatively benign risk environment have provided the basis for investors to engage in a vast range of so-called “carry trades”. These involve borrowing to invest in an asset that is either yielding – or is expected to yield – a higher rate of return than the borrowing cost. In this regard, relatively low risk aversion and market volatility are important conditions for carry trades, so that traders are less fearful that sharp market moves could eliminate the expected yield differential. Currency carry trades, whereby investors borrow in low interest rate currencies to invest in higher interest rate currencies, have been some of the most popular. Relatively low interest rates in some economies, particularly Japan and Switzerland, have been used as the basis for a raft of leveraged investments and in so doing have further fuelled global liquidity. Figure 6: Global policy rates Source: DataStream BIS Review 25/2007 5 
The events of the past few weeks have provided a timely reminder of the importance of low risk aversion and market volatility for the carry trade. Fears sparked by a sharp retracement in China’s share market and growing concerns regarding the ramifications of problems in the US sub-prime mortgage market saw investors rush to reduce positions in a range of markets. Notably, this episode saw currency carry trades scaled back, with funding currencies strengthening and recipient currencies weakening – although the sell-off proved highly correlated across a wide range of asset classes. This period of turbulence has proved relatively contained to date, with risk appetites and markets recovering. But it does demonstrate the potential widespread impact of an increase in risk aversion and market volatility. Figure 7: Market developments since the beginning of the year  Source: Bloomberg 4. How does it impact on the NZ economy? Given our relatively high interest rates, New Zealand has attracted a disproportionate share of global liquidity in recent years, putting upward pressure on the NZ dollar despite a relatively large current account deficit. These flows have come in many forms. One particular avenue has been the issuance of NZ dollar denominated bonds in offshore markets: Eurokiwi and Uridashi bonds. The derivative transactions associated with Eurokiwi and Uridashi issuance have provided a mechanism for the New Zealand banks to hedge the interest rate and currency risks associated with their offshore borrowings at cheaper rates than would otherwise have been the case. The upward pressure this has put on the New Zealand dollar and downward pressure on interest rates has exacerbated the current problematic imbalance between traded and non-traded sectors in New Zealand. 6 BIS Review 25/2007 
Figure 8: Offshore NZ dollar denominated bond issuance (Eurokiwi & Uridashi bonds)  Source: Reuters; Bloomberg; RBNZ But it is important to recognise that the attractiveness of the NZ dollar for offshore investors is not just a reflection of the current level of interest rate differentials, but also investors’ views regarding their sustainability. In this regard, it is interesting to note the relatively close correlation between house prices and the NZ dollar over the last 15 years. Without claiming a direct relationship between the two, this goes some way to illustrate the extent to which persist domestic inflation pressures have underpinned the outlook for interest rates, which in turn has maintained upward pressure on the NZ dollar. Accordingly, a sustained retracement in the NZ dollar from the highs seen in recent years could be contingent on our efforts to rein in domestic inflation pressures. Figure 9: House prices and the NZ dollar Trade Weighted Index (TWI) Source: Quotable Value; RBNZ BIS Review 25/2007 7 
Of course the inward capital flows that have kept pressure on the NZ dollar would not have happened without a strong domestic demand for borrowing. In this case it is New Zealand households’ desire to keep investing in housing, while at the same time consuming strongly, that fuels their demand for funds, and represents the other leg to these international transactions. 5.  How does it affect monetary policy? No central banker today can ignore these effects on domestic monetary policy. A recent speech by Ben Bernanke4 observed that financial market globalisation has made the Fed’s analysis much more complex. He notes that even for the US there is no such thing as total monetary independence. For example, correlations between long term interest rates in the US and other industrial countries have risen significantly. Having said that, he concludes that, despite Alan Greenspan’s term of “conundrum”, this has not significantly constrained their ability to influence domestic financial conditions. This is more problematic for a number of small open economies with higher interest rates – not only New Zealand, but also Iceland, Hungary, Australia and South Africa. The downward pressure created by abundant global liquidity on market interest rates has had implications for the operation of monetary policy. In general terms, the Reserve Bank has most impact on the shorter end of the yield curve, both by setting the OCR itself and influencing market expectations about the outlook for monetary policy. But further out the yield curve, other factors – including global interest rate developments and country risk premia – also influence interest rate levels. Figure 10: A stylised representation of the relative influences on the yield curve  Source: RBNZ Low global interest rates have restrained the rise in longer-term interest rates relative to the upward pressure monetary policy has been able to exert on shorter-term interest rates during this tightening cycle. This has seen the yield curve progressively flatten and become negatively-sloped during the past few years.                                                       4  “Globalisation and Monetary Policy”, March 2007 8 BIS Review 25/2007 
Figure 11: The change in the yield curve since the beginning of the tightening cycle  Source: Bloomberg Figure 12: New Zealand and US long term interest rates  Source: Bloomberg A negatively-sloped yield curve has encouraged borrowers to take out term loans at relatively lower rates. Households in particular have favoured fixed rate mortgages, which now account for more than 80 percent of mortgage borrowing, and increasingly for longer terms. This has muted and delayed the impact of policy tightening in this cycle, although we have now seen the effective mortgage rate rise by around 110 basis points since its lows in late 2003. BIS Review 25/2007 9 
Figure 13: The OCR and the effective mortgage rate  Source: RBNZ A further practical constraint for us has been that, although the TWI is influenced by a wide range of global events, in recent years we have not wished to add to upward pressure on the NZ dollar. We have also remained conscious of our obligation to avoid unnecessary instability in output, the exchange rate and interest rates, as required under section 4b of the Policy Targets Agreement. This has meant we have been more cautious in our OCR tightening path than might otherwise have been the case. 6. New Zealand policy in a global context The circumstances we face at present do not necessarily represent an enduring structural change in the environment in which policy operates. At some stage in the future when the large East Asian trading blocs are able to trade currencies and products with the world at more sustainable prices, a significant distortion to our own rate setting process will be removed. However, for that we must wait for G-7, Doha and other international forces to do their work. As for New Zealand, we need to see realisation amongst borrowing households and lending banks that this recent period of cheap international money has been unusual, and at some point will revert to more normal financial conditions. That means thinking about other eventualities ahead, and in some cases showing less exuberance. Monetary policy always impacts with long and variable lags. Those lags have been longer in this cycle, but as household debt grows the OCR becomes a more potent policy instrument. We are continuing to assess alternative measures that might support the OCR, working with the relevant government agencies. These include a tightening of tax rules applying to housing investment and changes to bank capital requirements to help moderate the amplifying effect of credit on the housing cycle. However, we will continue to rely on the OCR as the primary instrument of monetary policy. 10 BIS Review 25/2007 
Ajith Nivard Cabraal: Overview of financial and economic developments in Sri Lanka  Keynote address by Mr Ajith Nivard Cabraal, Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, at the Opening of the Financial Services Academy at the Centre for Banking Studies, Rajagiriya, 5 March 2007. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen: Today we all have gathered here to witness an important step towards the development of the financial landscape and knowledge pool of the country, the establishment of the Financial Services Academy, a landmark organization that we hope, would shape the future of our financial services industry. As we know, the Sri Lankan economy recorded a growth of 7.8 per cent in the first three quarters of 2006 and according to current available data, it is very likely that the economic growth in 2006 would be well over 7 per cent. This will be the highest since 1978. Towards such growth, the contribution of the services sector was easily the highest and of such high growth sector, the growth in financial services was highly significant. It is therefore widely acknowledged that the contribution of the financial sector for the achievement of growth of the country is enormous, and whatever we do in that connection, would be of overall immense value.  The developments in the financial sector also helps the economic growth through several other channels as well: It improves the efficiency of business processes, attracts investment, reduces unemployment and enhances access to finance, to name a few. We are happy that during the recent years, our financial sector has also improved in every respect. This is clearly evident when we look around the financial institutions, financial markets and the developments in financial infrastructure.  Within the last five years, assets of the licensed banks in the country doubled. Altogether, there has been an addition of over 400 branches of these banks. Other financial institutions including Registered Finance Companies, Leasing Companies, Insurance Companies, Merchant banks, Venture capital firms and Unit Trusts have also grown in sympathy with the banking sector. At the same time, we have also progressed rapidly in the financial infrastructure developments as well. This is particularly visible with the leap forward in the Payment System development as evidenced by the implementation of a Real Time Gross Settlement System in 2003. Now, 84 per cent of the value of country’s payments are settled through the RTGS system. In 2006, we completed the Cheque Image Truncation project, reducing the maximum cheque clearance time to 2 working days, which is another significant achievement. The Colombo Stocks Exchange remains one of the most technically advanced stock exchanges of the world. Soon, we will also have a SWIFT Service Bureau in Sri Lanka and that will help to reduce cost of financial transactions. Together with these infrastructure developments, our banking system has expanded their horizons by introducing several innovative infrastructure facilities and complex financial products as well. The ATM network of the country has doubled during the last five years and the number of credit cards in use have more than tripled. Improvements in Internet banking, tele-banking and mobile banking facilities are very significant and the progress is mind-boggling.  There have been significant improvements in financial markets too. With the introduction of LankaSecure, the Scripless Securities Settlement System, in 2004, government securities are transacted on Delivery versus Payments (DvP) basis and now nearly 27,000 beneficiary accounts are maintained at the LankaSecure. Recently we also allowed foreigners to own 5% of government securities through a new TIERA account that we introduced, and so far, foreigners have purchased US$ 55 million worth of Treasury bonds. This is a new instrument that has enhanced liquidity in the capital market Developments in the foreign exchange market are also immense. Helped by the continuous growth in imports and exports, and specially with the recorded improvement in migrant earnings, values and BIS Review 24/2007 1 
volumes of forex transactions through formal channels have improved significantly during recent years. The initiatives we are taking will also improve this sector further in the years to come. In conjunction with these improvements, banks have now stepped forward to introduce new derivative instruments to the market. As you all know, CPC has now started to use hedging mechanisms to minimize the exchange rate exposure, which we expect that would be followed soon by other large public and private sector organizations. Performance of the Share Market has of course been spectacular. The Colombo Stock Market has gained by 35% on average during the past 5 years. The growth during the last year was over 50% and the trend has continued so far during the year. With the expansion of CSE to regional cities such as Matara and Kandy, the contribution of outstation customers in stock market activities have increased significantly and this trend should be encouraged. However in comparison to other regional countries, our Insurance penetration rate is still low, although the developments in the industry during recent years have been impressive. As the country observes these developments in the financial sector, the regulatory mechanism has strengthened as it should be. The Central Bank continues to supervise the banking sector, finance companies, leasing companies, and money changers. Stock exchanges and stock brokers are regulated by the SEC. IBSL has the role of regulating the Insurance Industry. All these developments have necessitated more and more people who are skilled, knowledgeable and trained on financial services. As stated in the bestseller of Robert Kiyosaki, the reason as to why most of the poor and middle class people financially struggle, while the rich continue to remain rich for generations, is mainly because of the lack of financial intelligence and insight, as the real financial education is usually conveyed by parents to their children and not taught formally at schools. Perhaps, this applies not only to individuals but to countries as well. May be, one of the reasons as to why we remain under-developed while developed countries progress faster, may be because of our shortage of human capital, with specific and adequate financial insights and awareness. If this situation is to be rectified, we need to develop well financially-educated people to operate financial institutions. We need well trained people to regulate these institutions.  We need the investors to master the art of investment. All in all, we need our future generations to acquire sufficient financial knowledge.  At the same time, I hope the knowledge that would be disseminated by this newly formed FSA would, also be valuable to change the attitudes of our financial journalists as well. In that regard, I hope that some of these courses may provide opportunities for our journalists too, to better understand financial service related subjects so that they will be able to provide a more meaningful interpretation of such matters. That too would, hopefully, enhance the general public’s understanding of financial operations and I look forward to such an outcome as well. As we all know there is today a vast majority of people who lack the knowledge to take advantage of the enormous opportunities that may be actually right in front of them. I think we have now taken the initiative to rectify that situation. The Financial Services Academy, established today, jointly by the SEC and the IBSL is a great move in that direction, and I hope that the FSA would grow to be a leading institution in financial education not only in Sri Lanka but also in the region.  2 BIS Review 24/2007 
Axel A Weber: Challenges posed by (financial) globalisation  Lecture by Professor Axel A Weber, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the University of Pune, Pune, 15 March 2007.  *      *      * 1 Introduction  Dear Mr. Jadhav, members of the University of Pune, ladies and gentlemen  This is my first visit to India. Although I flew in only ten hours ago, I am already quite impressed by what I have seen in my very brief time here. The official slogan of the Indian ministry of tourism is: “Incredible India!” This is almost a perfect description of my impressions so far.  My speech is entitled “Challenges posed by (financial) globalisation”. Regarding globalisation, there isn’t any other term which has attracted nearly as much attention over the past ten years. It is quite justified to say that globalisation and its implications are the “topic of the decade”. And I think that globalisation is very likely to maintain this position in the foreseeable future.  The process of globalisation has various facets. Hence, there are many angles from which one might look at this process (for example, historical, political, social, or economic). Not surprisingly, in most of my remarks, I shall take a central banker’s point of view: I shall focus mainly on the economic implications of the ongoing global integration. Besides financial aspects of globalisation, I shall cover real economic aspects as well, since both features cannot be meaningfully separated.  2  Globalisation: basic remarks and characteristics  Let me start by making some basic observations with respect to globalisation. Globalisation is a term referred to pretty often in the media, and by politicians and economists. However, there is no single definition of what globalisation actually means nor is there a single key figure for measuring its scale and evolution over time.  To me, a useful approach to defining globalisation is that, quite fundamentally, the term “globalisation” describes the ongoing process of the international division of labour. In the wake of this process, the domestic markets for goods and services, as well as the labour markets, are becoming more and more interlinked and interdependent internationally.  In the absence of a single yardstick to gauge the extent to which globalisation is evolving, it is useful to look at various developments that, in combination, reflect this process quite well. Primarily, there are three elements that characterise globalisation.  First: The steadily rising volume of global trade, whose growth rate has been exceeding that of global GDP for a long time now. On average, global trade has grown 50% faster than world GDP over the past 35 years. During the 1990s, global trade even grew twice as fast as global GDP. Among the reasons explaining this development, there are a number of factors which have particular relevance. More and more goods and services are becoming tradable. In addition, companies and economies have become more involved in foreign trade. As a result, the degree of real economic openness of many countries, measured by total exports and imports of goods and services as a ratio of GDP, has increased significantly. In the German case, the relevant figure amounted to roughly 75% last year, compared with just over 60% in 1990.  Second: The ongoing internationalisation of production processes, measured, for example, by the growing volume of foreign direct investments (FDI). FDIs have increased considerably since the 1970s. According to UNCTAD figures, worldwide FDI stocks amounted to over USD10 trillion in 2005. About 77,000 transnational enterprises with roughly 770,000 branches are involved. FDI flows among developed countries still account for the majority of FDI flows. The share of developing countries as recipients of FDIs, though, has been increasing markedly over the past few years. However, the investment has been concentrated on just a few countries, mainly in Asia.  Third: The increasing openness of many economies in financial terms, measured by the ratio of the sum of external assets and liabilities to domestic GDP. For Germany, this figure currently amounts to roughly 340%, which is three times as high as in 1990. Compared with other developed countries, BIS Review 31/2007 1 
Germany is among those with a high degree of financial openness. In addition, the increasing financial openness of many economies has also been reflected by strongly rising international capital flows, for example, in terms of cross-border securities transactions.  The process of globalisation has been evolving among developed countries for many decades now. Therefore, in contrast to what some observers might think, the current process of globalisation per se is neither new nor of special uniqueness. Rather, it is the logical outcome of efforts to further exploit the benefits of the division of labour on an international scale.  However, the pace of this process has been increasing rapidly for more than a decade now. In particular, declining costs of telecommunication and transportation have been the main drivers of this development. In addition, skill levels in many regions of the world have improved considerably as has the quality of goods and services produced in formerly rather underdeveloped countries.  Additionally, what has changed the face of globalisation is the fact that globalisation nowadays extends to a larger group of countries than in the past. More and more countries with formerly rather closed economies have opened themselves to the world market. Thus, new players have entered on to the global stage and are becoming increasingly relevant economic powers and, as a result, competitors to established developed countries.  As a consequence, the process of globalisation is leading to a shift in weights within the global economy. This shift is nothing exceptional. It is quite a natural development which simply reflects the continuously evolving global economic landscape. Within this process, China and India, in particular, have gained particular relevance over the past decade, in both economic and political terms.  In the case of India, there can be little doubt that the world’s largest democracy is an emerging global economic power. Its economic growth has averaged some 8% over the past four years, placing it among the world’s fastest-growing economies, while inflation has remained largely contained. Its dynamic development in foreign trade, for instance, has been quite impressive, too, thus leading to a rising share in the volume of global trade. “India goes global” – which is the title of a book that was published last year by the IMF – is an appropriate description of India’s recent development.  I think that the outlined process of globalisation is among the most important factors that have fuelled the global growth dynamics we have been seeing for more than four years now. And it is likely to keep on doing so, at least in the medium-term future. IMF estimates suggest that, unless we witness rather unexpected incidents, 2007 will be the fifth consecutive year with an above-average increase in global real GDP.  After having outlined major characteristics of the current process of globalisation, let me continue by elaborating more on its implications. 3  Implications and challenges of globalisation  3.1  Real economic implications  In various parts of the world, quite a lot of people are rather sceptical if they think about the real economic implications of globalisation. In fact, there is often an indistinct fear that globalisation is mainly a risky development in which the negative consequences clearly prevail. At the heart of concerns in developed countries are the fear of loss of jobs as well as the pressure on the social security systems.  While recognising the associated challenges, the fact that globalisation is basically a positive phenomenon cannot be stressed too much. What are the benefits of globalisation? According to foreign trade theory, the international division of labour, which exploits comparative cost advantages, leads, under competitive conditions, to efficiency gains and increases the average per capita income. Compared with a situation without foreign trade, the economies concerned have greater consumption possibilities. In addition, globalisation increases product variety, which is beneficial to consumers, and enlarges the input and output markets for companies. Finally, globalisation intensifies competition, thus fostering innovation, and accelerating the dissemination of technological expertise.  But it is not only economic theory which underlines that globalisation is a positive process. Besides the theoretical aspects, empirical evidence clearly shows that there is no developed country which has opted out of the world economy and the associated global exchange of goods and services.  2 BIS Review 31/2007 
In turn, actively participating in the globalisation process is a prerequisite for increasing real income and the living standard of the population, not an impediment to it. To me, it is obvious that globalisation, among other factors, has made a crucial contribution to increasing wealth in more and more parts of the world.  However, the integration of formerly rather closed economies into the world economy is a process which has to be set up prudently. Otherwise, the integration process might impact negatively on the domestic economy and the well-being of its population and might increase the risk of crisis instead of enhancing the chance of prosperity. This is true of the real sector, and especially of the financial sector and the task of liberalising capital flows.  The process of opening to the world economy needs to be accompanied, among other things, by a regulatory and supervisory system that strengthens financial institutions and their ability to manage risks as well as strengthening the resilience of the financial and economic system as a whole. Thus, domestic factors, above all, are of major importance if a country wishes to benefit from globalisation.  India’s approach of liberalising its capital flows as part of far-reaching economic reforms that were initiated in the early 1990s, has proved to be a well-founded strategy. With gradual and cautious steps, which have been carefully phased and sequenced across the country, India has successfully paved the way for the stronger position we see it in today.  Let me continue by looking more closely at the relationship between globalisation and monetary policy, which is certainly of special interest to a central banker.  3.2  Globalisation and monetary policy  For central banks, it is important to understand the forces and transmission channels of globalisation in order to calibrate the monetary policy stance in an adequate way given the domestic goals of monetary policy. Two aspects are of special interest for central banks: First, the way in which globalisation changes the domestic inflation processes. Second, the way in which globalisation alters the transmission of monetary policy measures – in other words, changes in the short-term interest rate – through the economic system.  By and large, the first aspect is closely related to real globalisation, whereas the second question deals with the consequences of financial globalisation.  Globalisation and inflation  The ongoing increase in real globalisation is coinciding with a decline in inflation rates worldwide. It is not surprising that these parallel developments have been given a causal interpretation along the lines that increased real globalisation has been driving down inflation rates. And, indeed, over the past six years, the price of manufacturing imports in the euro area has been rather stable, thus dampening, other things being equal, the increase in the overall consumer price index. The same developments could be observed in other mature economies as well.  This prima facie evidence seems to support the view that globalisation has been a main factor in low inflation rates. However, I am quite sceptical about whether the story of globalisation adequately captures the aspects that are most important for explaining the decline in inflation rates, at least for the euro area.  First, the increase in trade volumes relative to GDP is a process that was already under way in the 1970s and 1980s. However, inflation rates during this period were substantially higher than today. Second, the effects of increased trade with labour-abundant economies will affect only relative prices. It is a well-known fact that, for the aggregate price level and its rate of change, relative price effects have no ultimate influence.  It is monetary policy that, over the medium to long term, pins down trend inflation. Globalisation might have contributed to the observable decline in cross-country trend inflation as positive price shocks have created an environment in which some central banks could use “the opportunistic approach to disinflation”. But this does not seem a convincing explanation for the bulk of industrial countries.  Third, even the immediate relative price effects of trade with emerging economies are not as benign for inflation in industrial countries as is commonly assumed. The rapid industrialisation of economies like China and India has led to sharply rising energy demand from these countries. This demand has contributed markedly to the increases in oil and commodity prices over the past couple of years. It is BIS Review 31/2007 3 
difficult to estimate the net effect of these developments on the overall price level in industrial countries. But, in my view, there are no reasons to assume that the overall outcome has been one of a more benign inflation outlook.  Taken all together, there are reasons for exercising caution with regard to the popular globalisation story of inflation. In other words, in my view, the real effects of globalisation on the inflation process are an issue that should be of some interest for monetary policymakers. But, at the end of the day, the importance commonly attached to globalisation forces is less clear than popular views often assume.  The decline in trend inflation worldwide is better explained by monetary policy in many countries being geared towards price stability, which is enhanced by the increasing independence of central banks in achieving their goals. Globalisation will have played a supportive role, but, in the final analysis, it is monetary policy that is responsible for medium to long-term inflation outcomes.  Financial globalisation and the transmission of monetary policy  Another aspect of globalisation with potential crucial implications has to do with the impressive growth in cross-border financial flows. As domestic asset prices are increasingly determined by global factors, the transmission channels of monetary policy measures might change as well. This is especially relevant to long-term interest rates as they constitute one of the main variables through which monetary policy influences economic outcomes and inflation.  Does globalisation mean that monetary policy is losing its leverage over domestic long-term interest rates? And if so, does this mean monetary policy is becoming ineffective?  I do not want to go too much into the details. Let me just make two points: First, even if it is true that long-term interest rates are increasingly determined on the global capital market, this by no means renders monetary policy ineffective.  One of the workhorses of international macroeconomic theory, the Mundell-Fleming model, dealt with precisely this issue some 40 years ago. And you are familiar with the result that, as long as you operate a flexible exchange rate, monetary policy becomes the more effective the higher the degree of capital mobility is. The exchange rate channel then more than compensates for the decline in the ability to influence long-term rates.  Second, one might debate whether influence over long-term rates is the most important way in which central banks achieve their goals. Issues such as the transparency, independence and credibility of monetary policy are, in my view, far more important in stabilising inflation expectations and thus safeguarding price stability.  3.3  Globalisation and financial stability aspects  Apart from its likely influence on inflation and the conduct of monetary policy, financial globalisation is increasingly affecting financial stability aspects as well. The term “financial stability” broadly describes the financial system’s ability to perform its key functions efficiently, including in stress situations and periods of profound structural change. This embraces the efficient allocation of financial resources, the settlement of payments and securities transactions, and the spreading and pricing of risk.  The importance which many central banks attach to the stability of the financial systems has increased substantially over the past few years. Regarding financial globalisation, the main reason for this development is that the internationalisation of financial flows has increased the degree of integration of the national financial systems and has therefore also heightened the risks of contagion in the event of turbulence.  Financial stability issues are, at least implicitly, also a task for central banks. What is the basic rationale behind this conclusion? The central banks’ primary objective of safeguarding monetary stability, and thereby facilitating sustainable growth and development, is based on the prerequisite of a stable financial system. In fact, monetary and financial system stability are intertwined phenomena: Monetary stability can be maintained only if the financial system is sufficiently stable to transmit monetary policy signals, for example. In turn, a stable financial system is unthinkable without monetary stability, which is a necessary, albeit not sufficient prerequisite for financial stability.  With respect to current challenges or, rather risks to financial stability, let me finally and rather briefly mention two developments which are of continuing – or even increasing – global relevance.  4 BIS Review 31/2007 
First aspect: global imbalances  The issue of global imbalances has been a continuous part of nearly every analysis dealing with risks to the world economy over the past few years. The term ‘imbalances’ refers to today’s uneven pattern in trade and, closely related to this, capital flows among major countries or regions. In this connection, it is the US current account that has attracted most attention among economists and policymakers as well.  Basically, today’s situation is characterised by the fact that the US, in particular, is recording large trade deficits, thus requiring substantial net capital inflows, with other countries – especially in emerging Asia, but also oil exporting countries – providing this capital through sizeable trade surpluses. Today’s uneven pattern in global trade and capital flows is being accompanied by a massive accumulation of foreign exchange reserves – mostly in these Asian or oil-exporting surplus regions. This reveals that the unprecedented accumulation of foreign exchange reserves, following large current account surpluses in many emerging market countries, is as much a part of global imbalances as is the US current account deficit.  Global imbalances are an ongoing matter of concern since they still harbour the latent risk of a disorderly unwinding, with substantial negative consequences for global economic growth, employment and stability. Thus, successfully rebalancing the global economy remains a pressing issue of global relevance. Undoubtedly, this goal can only be achieved through the combined policy actions of all parties involved.  Second aspect: search for yield in riskier assets  The search for yield in riskier assets was one of the main topics during the time of record-low interest rates in major economic regions. Key central bank interest rates as well as long-term market interest rates have moved upwards in the meantime, while remaining rather moderate by historical standards. Therefore, the search for yield in riskier assets still seems to define the actions of many market participants.  Despite the marked corrections in various financial markets quite recently, there are ongoing signs of relatively low risk premia and still increasing use of leveraged instruments, such as in the credit markets. Both developments reflect a rather pronounced feeling of complacency among many market participants. This raises the question of whether risks are appropriately reflected in the prices of various financial assets.  Why does search for yield entail risks? The search for yield in riskier assets might be a profitable investment if economic conditions remain as favourable as they are at present. However, an unexpected deterioration in the macroeconomic environment, for instance, could trigger a turnaround in sentiment with widespread repercussions. It is therefore key that risks are adequately taken into account and priced appropriately. The ongoing search for yield in riskier assets warrants further close monitoring by central banks.  4  Concluding remarks  Globalisation, defined as the process of the international division of labour, is a quite natural process in an economic environment that is evolving continuously. Basically, it is beneficial for all the countries participating in this process. However, the degree to which a country can benefit from the opportunities of open markets is determined mainly by domestically influenced factors. India has shown how to integrate successfully in the global exchange of goods and services and has become an emerging market economy of major importance.  Moreover, (financial) globalisation poses various challenges to both the domestic and global economic and monetary policy environment. The analysis of these challenges, their origin and possible implications, remains on the top of many central banks’ agenda. Coping successfully with these challenges continues to be vital to fostering sustainable growth and development in many parts of the world and is hence a matter of global interest.

David Dodge: Promoting sound economic policies globally and locally Remarks by Mr David Dodge, Governor of the Bank of Canada, to the Americas Society and the Council of the Americas, New York, 29 March 2007. *      *      * It has been three years since I last had the opportunity to address the Council of the Americas. Since then, the global economy has continued to expand at a remarkable pace. Indeed, over the past five years, it has grown more than in any five-year period since the Second World War. In my opinion, much of this performance can be credited to the increasingly widespread acceptance of the need for a liberalized worldwide financial and trade order. Many countries that once closed themselves to the outside world are now actively engaged in the global economy. Notable examples are China, India, and, within the Americas, Chile. Many states that twenty five years ago would have been considered "less-developed countries," or that were within the sphere of the former Soviet Union, are now experiencing the benefits of economic openness, and millions of people have been lifted out of extreme poverty.  In Canada and the United States, it is understood by many – although certainly not by all – that it is in our own interest, both economic and geopolitical, to increase the number of countries taking part in a liberalized financial and trade order. While there have been clear successes, particularly in Asia, there have also been clear disappointments. Within Latin America, there have perhaps been more disappointments than successes. And even in those Latin American countries that have taken real steps to join the global economy, anti-globalization sentiment remains quite strong. So today, I want to talk about the factors that have led to either success or setback in our progress towards a liberalized global framework for trade and finance. Then, I want to talk about the particular challenges that we face in promoting active involvement in the global economy by countries throughout Latin America. I will confine my remarks to economics, although the challenges clearly extend well beyond this domain. Developing a global policy framework The best place to begin is with the aftermath of World War II. Delegates to the Monetary and Financial Conference at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, began to create an economic order where trade could flourish, and postwar reconstruction could take place. Led by a strong contingent of American, British, and, if I may say so, Canadian representatives, the delegates set out to establish new international institutions. These would serve as tables around which policy-makers would gather to work out what could be called the "rules of the game" for a new financial and trade order.  Over time, policy-makers at these new institutions had some real success in developing the rules of the game for several important areas. Early on, there was the establishment of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which would become the World Bank. Later, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade was launched, which would ultimately become today's World Trade Organization (WTO). And over time, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) evolved to become a venue where financial authorities could gather and discuss how best to promote strong economies through liberalized markets, freer trade, and sound macroeconomic policies.  Initially, the rules of the game were meant to apply to many of the so-called "first world" nations, including the United States, Canada, Western Europe, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand. And for many years after the Second World War, the rules that had been developed served these countries reasonably well. Indeed, the global economic order was sufficiently successful that a number of other nations began to see how their economies and their citizens could benefit from taking part in it. And so, more nations began to adopt the policy frameworks needed to become engaged in an increasingly inter-connected global economy. I'll have more to say on this in a few minutes. But first, I want to discuss the struggles of policy-makers to keep the rules of the game relevant, given the changing nature of the global economy. BIS Review 31/2007 1 
Updating the rules of the game The need to keep the rules of the game updated is no surprise. After all, the world economy has changed tremendously over the past few decades. Enormous advances in transportation, communications, and information technology have led to widespread gains in productivity and massive changes in the structure of the world economy. While this has been going on, new economic powerhouses have emerged. In response to these developments, the rules of the game have evolved somewhat, as have the institutions supporting the global financial and trade order. But to be blunt, neither the rules nor the institutions have fully kept up with the times.  To illustrate my point, I'm going to say a few words about the IMF in particular. The Fund was critical in establishing some of the rules for monetary policy and exchange rates in the years immediately following the Second World War. But more recently, the IMF has been perceived by some countries as being irrelevant, and its activities have sparked resentment and outright hostility in other countries, including some in Latin America. A major source of this hostility and perception of irrelevance is the fact that the Fund has not evolved in step with the global economy. And this lack of evolution contributed to the Fund's inability to prevent or even to mitigate international crises such as the Asian Crisis of 1997 and the Argentinean crisis in 2001. In the absence of global co-operation to update the rules of the game, and an effective IMF to support these rules, we have seen a drift towards regional initiatives. And rather than using the IMF to efficiently pool international reserves, countries such as China have set out to accumulate very high levels of reserves.  I have made several speeches in other places about the need to strengthen the surveillance function of the IMF, to improve its governance, and to make it more representative of today's global economy. I won't repeat those arguments here; if you are interested in the details of our recommendations for the IMF, I'd invite you to read the lecture I gave one year ago at Princeton University.  The point I want to make today is that strengthening the IMF could help some countries – including those in Latin America – to willingly support and engage with the Fund. And this would increase the chances that these countries would willingly engage in the global economy. Unfortunately, in recent years, the attention of Canada and the United States has focused mainly on Asia. We have worked hard to help the Asian economies integrate into the global economy and take their rightful place at the policy-makers' table. We've encouraged these countries to play by the rules of the game with respect to international trade, in particular, by supporting their accession to the WTO. But at the same time, we have become concerned that these nations, notably China, are not always following the rules of the game with respect to monetary and exchange rate issues. Rather than deal with this issue through a strengthened IMF, we in the G-7, including the United States, have often dealt with it on a country-by-country basis. My contention is that all of us in the G-7, particularly the United States – which truly believes in a liberal financial and trade order – should lead the effort to strengthen multilateral institutions, such as the IMF. Not only would a stronger IMF be a more effective forum for dealing with the policy challenges now seen in Asia, it would also be more effective in encouraging the countries of Latin America to engage more fully in a liberalized financial and trade order.  Policy challenges in Central and South America Because of our recent focus on Asia, we have, in many ways, neglected the need to promote economic progress and development in our own backyard. We need to pay equal attention to encouraging global economic involvement and promoting appropriate policies in our hemisphere, so that the countries of Latin America and their citizens can share the benefits of globalization. But this is not a simple task. The challenges of Latin America differ from those in Asia and other regions. And the task is made more difficult because there is no table around which the economic policy-makers of this hemisphere regularly gather. There is the Organization of American States (OAS), but it deals mainly with political and strategic issues. There is CEMLA, but it deals with the limited range of issues common to the central bankers of the Americas. There is the Inter-American Development Bank, but it is more project-oriented than policy-oriented. And at the IMF, the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean island nations are divided among four executive directors. In short, we really do need a table around which all the economic policy-makers of the Americas can gather. Unfortunately, there is no OECD for the Americas.  2 BIS Review 31/2007 
If there were an OECD for the Americas, what would it do? Essentially, it could serve the same function as the original OECD did for Western Europe. It could be a forum where economic policy-makers would discuss how best to promote strong economies through sound monetary, financial, and fiscal policies, as well as how to promote liberalized markets and freer trade.  I do not know how such a table could be created, or how we could ensure that discussions would be as fruitful as the ones at the OECD. But creating such a table could be a very positive step, and I would be most interested in hearing your thoughts on this during our discussion period. Monetary policy Let me now take a few minutes to discuss some of the issues that could be dealt with at an OECD for the Americas. I'll begin with my subject area: monetary policy. The first point to make is that Latin America has to overcome a history of high inflation and, occasionally, hyperinflation. High inflation has not only held back economic development in Latin America, it has also had a devastating effect on its poorest citizens, who cannot shield themselves from its pernicious consequences. Inflation has exacerbated the problems of an already skewed income distribution. Some countries have made substantial progress in getting inflation under control and keeping it under control. I am thinking here of Chile, Mexico, and more recently, Brazil. In these cases, central banks were given sufficient independence from government and tasked with controlling inflation, although I hasten to add that the independence of the Brazilian central bank has never been formally legislated. These central banks were then able to make progress by adopting an inflation-targeting framework, supported by a floating exchange rate.  In a Latin American setting, inflation targeting has been tremendously helpful in promoting macroeconomic stability, facilitating investment, and very importantly, aiding the most vulnerable members of society. Indeed, a low-inflation environment has allowed banks to offer credit to some households for the very first time – often a crucial first step in escaping poverty. I'll say more about the banking sector in a moment. I should also mention that some smaller nations in the Caribbean and Central America have achieved low inflation, quite appropriately, by fixing their exchange rate to the U.S. dollar.  But while we can celebrate some monetary progress, we must also consider the country with the most troubled monetary policy history: Argentina. This is a country that has all the natural advantages needed to be one of the richest in the hemisphere. But Argentina has consistently failed to live up to its potential, and bad policy choices are largely to blame. The independence of Argentina's central bank has been repeatedly undermined, and unfortunately, the current policy path chosen by the government is once again leading to high inflation in that country. Of course, Argentina isn't alone in this regard. Perhaps the most important thing that Canada and the United States can do is to demonstrate our support for those countries that have made the right policy choices. In this way, we can show the citizens and their governments that they are on the right path to development. That is why the Bank of Canada has worked closely with the Banco Central de Chile, the Banco de México, and the Banco Central do Brasil, to provide support and technical assistance as they implemented inflation targeting. Financial system policy  Next, I'll say just a few words about financial system policy. Here, I'm referring to the rules governing banking and the financial sector, as well as policies to support sound clearing and settlement systems. This is an area that is often overlooked. A sound and stable banking sector is, of course, enormously helpful in encouraging investment, which leads to increased employment and economic activity. And, as I just mentioned, extending access to credit to a broader segment of the population is a critical step towards economic progress. With increased access to credit, the poorest members of society are enabled to break out of the poverty trap. Progress in the financial sector area has been quite good in several countries for a number of years. Indeed, one could argue that there has been more progress in Latin America on financial system policies than there has been in Asia. The result has been that some commercial banks from the United States, Canada, and Europe, have expanded into the region. But it is important that we also encourage local financial institutions in Latin America. In the long run, having a sound and vibrant BIS Review 31/2007 3 
financial sector in place is in everybody's interest, even those financial institutions that would face increased competition in these markets. Another point to be made here is that policies must be put in place to encourage the development of local capital markets across Latin America, beginning with government bond markets. It is through both capital markets and financial institutions that savings are efficiently turned into productive investments, stimulating economic growth and helping to alleviate unemployment and poverty.  Clearly, an OECD-like table, where policy-makers in Latin America can learn from each other, and from our experience in Canada and the United States, could be tremendously helpful in this area. It would be very beneficial to have a forum where economic policy-makers could gather to discuss issues and devise solutions to help strengthen financial sector policies across the Americas. Fiscal policy Now let me turn to fiscal policy. In many ways, this has been the Achilles heel of Latin American economic policy. There are very few examples of sound fiscal frameworks in the region, although I would point to Chile, which has adopted the prudent policy of sequestering the windfall gains realized from the sharp increase in the prices of its exports. Elsewhere, Mexico and Brazil have made some progress, although not as much as they might like to see. And even where there has been improvement, countries still lack an anchor for their fiscal policy, although I have to acknowledge that, more often than not, the problems are political rather than economic. That's no different from the situation in many of the OECD countries in the 1960s and 1970s. But what was helpful to the fiscal authorities of the OECD is that they received support from the analysis carried out at that institution, as well as from their colleagues around the OECD table. This is another area where a regional table for the Americas would be a tremendous help. Fiscal authorities from the region could gather to exchange policy advice and develop strategies to deal with their situations. And civil servants could gather to share best practices with regard to tax and expenditure issues. We in Canada and the United States can offer advice. But, ultimately, fiscal policy in most of Latin America is a political problem, and it will be up to the people and governments of Latin America to solve it. Trade policy The final area I want to address is trade policy. We can all agree that more open trade is key to economic development. Canadians and Americans have clearly benefited from freer trade, and there is a reasonable degree of support for further trade liberalization. However, in Latin America, there is much greater resistance to freer trade, and much greater popular support for protectionist policies. Indeed, a number of countries have chosen to adopt trade policies that impede growth and jeopardize improvements in living standards. But while governments in Canada and the United States generally favour and advocate freer trade, we don't always act on our own beliefs. And since we do a poor job in demonstrating our own willingness to live by the principles we espouse, it's not surprising that we in Canada and the United States have been unable to convince our neighbours in the Americas that the best way to raise incomes and lift people out of poverty is by taking on the challenges of free trade and global competition. One way for us to do a better job is to work more diligently towards a resumption of the Doha Round of trade talks, and to show a greater willingness to open our own markets to products in which Latin American countries have a comparative advantage. I recognize that it is easy for me, as a central banker, to say that we need to confront our own protectionism. But this is a political problem that we in Canada and the United States have to solve. These areas – monetary policy, financial sector policy, fiscal policy, and trade – are what I see as the four major economic policy challenges for Latin America. And these are four areas where it would be very helpful to have a forum for economic policy-makers in the Americas, a forum that could facilitate greater co-operation in the hemisphere. My remarks today reflect a long-standing tradition at the Bank of Canada of working with our central bank colleagues throughout the hemisphere. But beyond the Bank's collaboration in the region, Canada enjoys an enduring connection with the Americas. More Canadians now travel to Latin America and the Caribbean than to any other part of the world outside the United States. Canada joined the OAS and signed NAFTA in the early 1990s. Our involvement with the Americas has grown, encouraged by democratic transition, increased commercial and 4 BIS Review 31/2007 
investment opportunities, and the movement of people. And Canada's engagement will continue to grow. In a speech last month, our Prime Minister noted that Canada "will seek to re-engage relationships throughout the Americas, with our partners in Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central and South America." Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to conclude. The prosperity that we enjoy in Canada and the United States is a testament to the ability of free markets to generate wealth and raise living standards. We understand the gains that can come from building a strong global financial and trade order, backed by appropriate rules of the game. Other governments have worked hard to engage in this global order because they, too, understand the benefits that it can bring to their citizens. We now face two challenges. First, we must think globally about how best to update the rules of the game to take into account the evolving nature of the global economy. Second, we must act locally, within our own hemisphere, to help our neighbours to see that integration into the global economy is in everyone's interest. Neither of these tasks will be easy. They will require patience and persistence. And along the way, we will encounter governments that are more inclined to withdraw from the process than to engage with the global economy. But we can't let the difficulty dissuade us from our goal. To the delegates at Bretton Woods, the task of rebuilding the world's economy must have appeared daunting indeed. And there were times when the political will to see this task through appeared to be lacking. But eventually, a spirit of co-operation overcame the obstacles, and policy-makers gathered around tables at international institutions and built a liberalized financial and trade order – an order that has led to the prosperity we know today. It is time to rekindle that spirit of co-operation and to build a table for the Americas, so that the benefits of the global economy can be spread throughout our hemisphere.  BIS Review 31/2007 5 
Zeti Akhtar Aziz: Potential role of Islamic finance in strengthening the New Silk Road  Special address by Dr Zeti Akhtar Aziz, Governor of the Central Bank of Malaysia, at GIFF Investors & Issuers Forum: "Islamic Finance: The New Silk Road", Kuala Lumpur, 28 March 2007. *      *      * Up until the 14th century, the Silk Road served as a major global conduit between ancient civilizations in the East and West. It created mutual prosperity, encouraged knowledge transfer and enhanced understanding between civilisations through trade, cultural and technological exchange. Now in the 21st century, globalisation and liberalisation, and the emergence of new financial centres and their increased integration have created an environment of flourishing activity reminiscent of the Old Silk Road.  Indeed, it suggests that a New Silk Road has emerged. This new route not only carries flows of oil, manufactured goods, and technological innovation, but also flows of direct investment, portfolio capital, private equity and human capital. Previously, silk was one of the main commodities traded on this route. Now, the emergence of Islamic financial products and services has brought together financial services providers across continents to trade on this new route. The emergence of the New Silk Road reflects the increasing and evolving economic and financial relationships and inter-linkages, with Islamic finance well positioned to further facilitate these linkages to offer mutually-reinforcing benefits to those who participate in it. Indeed, the New Silk Road opens up the prospect of exciting opportunities for economic progress and prosperity for us all.  I first made reference to the New Silk Road at the 2nd World Islamic Economic Forum (WIEF) on "Unleashing the Potential of Emerging Markets" in Islamabad, Pakistan in November 2006.  It is my pleasure today to share some thoughts on the potential role of Islamic finance in strengthening the New Silk Road. My remarks will focus on four areas that is the emergence of the New Silk Road; how the linkages on the New Silk Road have built on the comparative advantages of Asia and the Middle East; how Islamic finance is able to foster the linkages along the New Silk Road; and finally, how we can extend the New Silk Road to the rest of the world to advance global economic stability and prosperity. The emergence of a New Silk Road Today, signs that a New Silk Road is flourishing are abundant. The economic and financial linkages between Asia and the Middle East are growing. While the world trade has on the average expanded by 10% over the period 2001-2005, Asia's trade with the Middle East has increased on the average by 24%. More than half of the exports from the Gulf states1 goes to Asia and more than one-fifth of its imports are from Asia. The Gulf is the major supplier of fuel to Asia, while Asia in turn supplies manufactured goods and food to the Gulf. Recent trends in investment activities have been equally significant. Investment projects amounting to more than USD160 billion to be financed by the Gulf states in Asia have been announced since 20052. In 2006 alone, mega-deals3 involving corporate acquisitions and real estate purchases from the Gulf to Asia, are estimated to total more than USD18 billion, including multi-billion dollar IPO purchases in financial institutions in China, large oil refineries and telecom companies. The value of such investments are expected to increase to between USD20-30 billion in 2007. For economic regions with high savings and surpluses such as Asia and the Middle East, the challenge is to recycle part of these surplus funds to productive investments in the region. The supply of savings in Asia and the Middle East is by far higher than in any other part of the world. Savings rates here in Asia are expected to remain in the region of 30-40% of GDP for some years to come.                                                       1  The Gulf Cooperation Council represents Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman and Kuwait 2   "A route to riches on the new Silk Road", Financial Times, 21 Dec 2006 3  Worth more than USD1 billion BIS Review 31/2007 1 
Similarly, savings in the Middle East economies have been rising in the recent decade and is expected to average about 30-35% of GDP in the coming years. In 2006, the current account surpluses as percentage of GDP for Asia and the Middle East were about 5% and 23% respectively4. With Asian official foreign currency reserves exceeding USD2 trillion, and Middle East oil revenues exceeding USD1 trillion since 2000, the management of surplus savings and reserves in both regions will offer significant investment opportunities. Besides the institutional pool of wealth, the rapidly expanding middle class in both regions is a further trend sustaining the high savings rate and the increased demand for more sophisticated including consumer finance and wealth management. In Asia alone, we now have more than 2.4 million high net worth individuals5, not far behind the US with 2.9 million and Europe with 2.8 million, and these Asian individuals control an estimated amount of USD7.2 trillion financial assets. The size of this group in Asia is estimated to be increasing at 7% per year, second only to those in the Middle East, numbering 300,000 and growing at 9% per year. Traditionally, investors in Asia and the Middle East have looked to the developed Western markets to meet their investment needs, in view of the more developed financial markets and the range of asset classes. Increasingly however, there is growing interest and search for improved returns on investment in other parts of the world. This has been a global phenomenon for some years now, characterised by excess liquidity and low yields in the traditional markets.  The New Silk Road creates linkages that build on the comparative advantages between Asia and the Middle East Ladies and Gentlemen, Historically, trade and investment in Asia and the Middle East has been linked to the developed economies. However, it is now increasingly recognised that there are significant complementarities between our two dynamic regions. These complementarities provide a platform for two-way flows that enhances income and wealth creation. The different demand patterns of each respective region reinforces the significance of the complementarities.  The Middle East investors have a greater need for diversification, both in terms of geographical allocation and asset classes, beyond the traditional investments in the US and Europe. Asia in turn, the home to some of the fastest growing economies in the world, offers highly diverse investment opportunities, ranging from in Vietnam to Japan, and in a broad scope of industries, ranging from natural resource producers to established high-tech brands. Such investment opportunities continue to support the growth momentum in the region. At the same time, Middle East domestic infrastructure requirements are estimated to total USD500 billion for the next five years, and Asian companies have demonstrated the capacity to provide the technology, expertise and human capital to meet these infrastructure demands. Asia's relentless march towards development offers new opportunities for the Middle East. Asia's continued need for productive capital and uninterrupted energy supply to sustain its high growth matches the Middle East's resource endowments. It is estimated that Asia needs USD 1 trillion worth of infrastructure investment over the next five years, and is in search of new partnerships and strategic investors to co-invest in these undertakings. In focussing on the respective comparative advantages and connecting via the New Silk Road, it contributes to expanding the opportunities in both the regions. Essentially, this extends the production possibility frontiers to create new areas of growth. The participation of a wider pool of investors also enables better risk sharing and consequently, increases the viability of projects as well as the returns to the investment. New value is also created is in mutually beneficial collaborations, such as in downstream energy activities. Products resulting from hybrid ideas are also evident in innovations in several areas, including in Islamic finance, with the early global sukuks being issued from Asia and the Middle East economies.                                                        4  Refers to IMF data 5  Refers to individuals with at least USD1 million in financial assets.

Islamic Finance: strengthening the financial linkages between Asia and the Middle East Ladies and Gentlemen, Islamic finance has demonstrated its viability and competitiveness in a more liberalised and globalised financial environment and has become important in strengthening the linkages between the two regions. While the sizeable Muslim populations in both regions have been attracted to the unique features of Islamic finance, it has also attracted interest and participation from non-Muslims within these regions. At present, there are more than 1006 Islamic banks in both regions, while Islamic financial transactions involving sovereigns and corporations have amounted to USD 35 billion during the period 2004 and 20067.  Several factors have supported this trend. The orientation of Islamic finance towards real underlying assets is aligned to the nature of the investment opportunities in both regions. Infrastructure and project finance in both regions are particularly suited for Islamic finance.  The emphasis in Islamic finance on risk-sharing and the equity-oriented nature of such financing also suits the requirements. The Islamic financial structures clearly distinguish the roles and responsibilities as well as risk and profit-sharing profiles of the parties involved. This clear delineation of the roles also promotes greater transparency and the appropriate governance. The nature of the structures also enables the risks to be transferred to those more able to contribute towards value creation.  In addition, the use of Islamic finance promotes stability in the financial markets and the financing flows, which is important for emerging market economies such as those in Asia and the Middle East. In Islamic finance, strategies to minimize and manage the risks involve integrating with the risk in the real activities. The real activities therefore needs to generate sufficient wealth to compensate for such risks. In contrast, conventional instruments generally separate the risks from the underlying assets. As a result, risk management and wealth creation may at times move in different or even opposite directions. Conventional financial instruments also allow for the commoditisation of risks, leading to its proliferation through multiple layers of leveraging and disproportionate distribution. These could result in higher systemic risks, increasing the potential for instability and inequitable concentration of wealth. The adoption of Islamic financial principles encourages financing to be primarily adopted as a means to facilitate real underlying economic transactions and not for speculative purposes. There are also clear value propositions in Islamic finance for both investors and issuers from both regions. For investors, Islamic financial products offer portfolio diversification and new investment opportunities as they avail themselves to a new asset class. They also encourage risk management and provides confidence through explicit disclosure and transparency of the roles and responsibilities defined in the contract. For issuers, Islamic finance allows access to a new source of funds and liquidity besides providing, new risk management options and new mechanisms for price discovery. Islamic finance is well positioned to be a vehicle on the New Silk Road, as the enabling supporting infrastructure is already in place. The required regulatory and legal frameworks for Islamic finance have been established, not only in a growing number of countries in both regions but also at the international level through standard-setting bodies such as the International Financial Services Board and the Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions (AAOIFI). Efforts towards the harmonisation of Shariah interpretations and issues concerning mutual recognition are at an advanced stage. The platforms for extending regional linkages and cross-border initiatives, including to the Middle East, are already in place within Asia, where there has been a significant degree of regional financial and economic integration.  Malaysia as an intermediary destination along the New Silk Road Malaysia is committed to and extensively engaged in strengthening linkages through Islamic finance. In collaboration with the participation of the industry representing the banking, takaful and capital markets in Malaysia, the regulators have worked towards enhancing the inter-linkages with the global                                                       6  Estimates based on the listing of Islamic financial institutions provided by the Institute of Islamic Banking and Insurance, London. 7  Data sourced from Islamic Finance Information Service website.

Islamic financial markets, not only by the further development of the Islamic financial infrastructure but also through increased liberalisation and through the implementation of measures to increase competitiveness of the financial services sector. This has included further liberalisation of the capital account of the balance of payments and the implementation of tax neutrality measures. Just as historical Malacca was a key port along the ancient trade routes between Asia and the Middle East, it is envisaged that Malaysia would serve as a key destination along the New Silk Road. Today, as part of Malaysia's efforts to further spur the infrastructure development of the Islamic financial system, it is my pleasure to announce that Bank Negara Malaysia, the Securities Commission, Bursa Malaysia and industry players have worked collaboratively towards establishing a mechanism referred to as the Commodity Murabahah House. This mechanism which uses crude palm oil as the underlying commodity will facilitate Islamic financing applying the concept of murabahah or tawarruq. BNM commodity murabahah acceptance As part of these efforts to promote development of products to meet the diversified requirements of investors, Bank Negara Malaysia is pleased to announce the introduction of a new Islamic monetary instrument, Commodity Murabahah Programme (CMP) as part of its diverse range of policy instruments in managing the short-term liquidity in the Malaysian Islamic inter-bank money market. Unique to Malaysia is that the CMP is designed to be the first ever commodity-based transaction that utilises the Crude Palm Oil based contracts as its underlying asset. The Bank has executed CMP master agreements with the eight Islamic banking institutions including the three foreign owned banking institutions to promote the use of the instrument for liquidity management. Several CMP transactions have now been conducted between the Central Bank and the respective Islamic Banks.  As commodity murabahah is widely used in other Islamic centres, it is envisaged that this CMP will promote increased linkages between Malaysia and these centres.  BNM Sukuk Murabahah/tawaruq short-term securities  The Central Bank also intends to diversify the issuance concept of the existing Islamic monetary notes from being based on Bai Inah and Ijarah into murabahah. Currently, the outstanding amount of the respective notes is RM 8 billion. This initiative is the continuation from the commodity murabahah acceptance initiative as the issuance involves the securitisation of the acceptance facility. There are several key benefits of issuing the Islamic Monetary Notes under this structure. It provides Islamic financial institutions an additional instrument to manage liquidity risk on a short-term basis. It is also a financial instrument whose structure has been widely used for retail banking and syndication products in the Middle East. Finally, it provides an opportunity for new investors to invest in Islamic financial papers in the Malaysian market, thus diversifying the investor base.  As part of the initiative to be linked to the global Islamic financial markets, this instrument will be promoted to the international financial market. Islamic Derivative Master Agreement (IDMA) Recognising the importance to develop Islamic hedging products for Islamic financial market to mitigate investment risks, Malaysia has introduced the first global Islamic Derivative master agreement to document Islamic derivative transactions. The effort is initiated by Bank Negara Malaysia and driven by the financial industry via the Persatuan Pasaran Kewangan Malaysia. The implementation of the agreement is expected to improve the risk management practices, balance sheet management, increase fund mobilisation efficiency and enhance their investment banking capability of the Islamic banking institutions. With the introduction of IDMA, the rights and obligations of contracting parties are clearly stated, thus creating an environment that is more transparent. As IDMA also incorporates best practices in market conduct, this document serves as an important catalyst for the future linkages between financial markets that offer Islamic financial market instruments. 4 BIS Review 31/2007 
Extending the New Silk Road to the world  Ladies and Gentlemen, While the New Silk Road is enhancing linkages between Asia and the Middle East, both regions have always extended the Silk Road to the rest of the world to participate in the these exciting developments on this route. Indeed, global investors and the international financial community are already drawing the benefits from the increased diversification of asset classes while riding on the dynamism of the two regions. As Islamic finance expands further, reinforced by the activities on the New Silk Road, there will be greater convergence towards ethical or socially responsible-type of investments (SRI) in the global financial community. Islamic investment guidelines share significant similarities with the SRI principles. The focus of Islamic investment not only involves the avoidance of riba-free activities but also extends to include issues related to ethical values, such as fair trade and environmental protection. Furthermore, the prospects of increased stability for financing flows and the focus on the role of real sector economic activities have ignited interest in utilising Islamic finance for sustainable development. This overwhelming gathering of so many issuers and investors here today provides some indication of the growing interest in Islamic finance, reinforcing the potential increased activity on the New Silk Road. We all have a part in the making of the New Silk Road into a vibrant source of wealth and prosperity in the global economy.  In closing, Malaysia is committed to be part of the New Silk Road to facilitate greater cross border economic and financial flows for increased inter-regional trade and investment transactions. Insya-Allah, the greater inter-regional economic and financial linkages would bring greater benefits which will be mutually reinforcing and contribute towards raising the prospects for greater global shared prosperity.

Lucas Papademos: Financial integration in Europe – March 2007 Introductory remarks by Mr Lucas Papademos, Vice President of the European Central Bank, at the ECB press conference on the occasion of the first publication of the report, Frankfurt am Main, 28 March 2007. *      *      * I. Introduction  On behalf of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank (ECB), I would like to welcome you to this press conference on the occasion of the publication by the ECB of a new yearly report, entitled “Financial Integration in Europe”.  The main purpose of this report, which we expect to publish towards the end of March every year, is to contribute towards the advancement of European financial integration and to raise public awareness of the Eurosystem’s role in supporting the financial integration process. Before I focus on the content of the report, let me first explain why we decided to regularly prepare and publish this report.  The Eurosystem has a keen interest in the integration and the efficient functioning of the financial system in Europe, particularly in the euro area, given their relevance to the fulfilment of our core tasks.  In particular, financial integration is of key importance for the conduct of the single monetary policy, as a well-integrated financial system enhances the smooth and effective transmission of monetary policy impulses throughout the euro area. Furthermore, financial integration is highly relevant to the Eurosystem’s task of contributing to safeguarding financial stability. It is also fundamental to the Eurosystem’s task of promoting the smooth operation of payment systems which also relate to the safe and efficient functioning of securities clearing and settlement systems. Finally, in accordance with the Treaty establishing the European Community, the Eurosystem supports, when this can be done without prejudice to the objective of price stability, the general economic policies of the Community which aim, inter alia, at “sustainable and non-inflationary growth”. Financial integration, which increases the efficiency and fosters the development of the financial system, helps to raise the economy’s potential for stronger non-inflationary economic growth. The ECB and the entire Eurosystem fully support the efforts of the private sector as well as those of the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers to enhance the integration and development of the European financial system. In this respect, let me emphasise that in the area of financial integration the ECB works in very close and effective co-operation with the European Commission which has a primary responsibility in this field. As such, the new ECB report complements, the work of the Commission aimed at enhancing European financial integration.  II.  Summary of the content of the report Let me now turn to the content of the report and draw your attention to some of the principal findings.  Our report is structured into three chapters. The first sets out the ECB’s assessment of “The state of financial integration in the euro area”. This assessment is based on a set of quantitative indicators developed by the ECB.1 The second chapter, entitled “Special Features”, contains in-depth analyses of selected issues relating to financial integration. The third chapter, “Eurosystem activities for financial integration” provides, an overview of the contribution of the Eurosystem towards a more integrated and developed financial market in Europe.                                                        1  From now on, this report will contain the indicators that previously appeared in the ECB report on “Indicators of financial integration in the euro area”. The most recent edition of that report was released in September 2006. The indicators will continue to be updated bi-annually on the ECB’s website. BIS Review 31/2007 1 
II.1 Indicators in the state of financial integration The ECB’s assessment of the state of financial integration in the euro area covers the money, bond, equity and banking markets, as well as market infrastructures. The evidence confirms that the degree of integration varies by the market segment and that it is generally more advanced in those market segments that are closer to the single monetary policy, especially the money market. The unsecured money market has been fully integrated since the introduction of the euro, and the repo market is also highly integrated. The full integration of the large-value payment systems has been instrumental in achieving this result. Government bond markets have become considerably integrated and similarly the corporate bond market received a major boost with the introduction of the euro and has subsequently achieved a high degree of integration.  Progress has also been made in the integration of euro area equity markets, where equity returns are increasingly determined by factors that are common to the euro area countries rather than country-specific ones. However, in other areas, financial integration needs to be enhanced. For example, the euro area securities infrastructure that underpins both bond and equity markets is not yet sufficiently integrated. Similarly, retail banking markets continue to be less integrated than other banking market segments. This situation is also reflected in the fragmented European retail payment systems and is addressed in more detail in one of the special features.  II.2 Special features The second chapter, “Special Features”, comprises in-depth assessments of selected issues relating to financial integration. In each edition of the report, these special features will typically address major policy issues, but may also contain analytical articles on the subject of financial integration. The topics are mainly selected on the basis of their importance to the EU’s financial integration agenda and their relevance to the pursuit of the ECB’s tasks. This first report covers the following three topics: “Monetary Policy and financial integration”, “Strengthening the EU framework for cross-border banks”, and “The SEPA initiative and its implications for financial integration”. The first special feature, “Monetary policy and financial integration”, focuses on the impact of financial integration on the monetary policy transmission mechanism. Deeper integration broadens the range of financing sources and investment opportunities and it creates economies of scale. It allows economic agents to share risks more effectively, thus improving their ability to mitigate or even offset the consequences of idiosyncratic shocks that might affect the individual economies within the euro area. A well integrated financial system is, therefore, crucial for the conduct of the single monetary policy, as it enhances the smooth and effective transmission of monetary policy impulses throughout the euro area. For example, in a well-integrated financial sector, cross-country differences in the way banks adjust their interest rates to changes in policy rates should be very limited. Indeed, thanks to increased financial integration, such differences have diminished over time, and this has contributed to the fact that the transmission mechanism operates in a broadly similar way across euro area countries. However, some discrepancies in the interest rate pass-through across countries seem to persist, which may reflect, in addition to the different structures of financial institutions and markets, a lack of sufficient financial integration.  Similarly, the level and the type of indebtedness of households and non-financial corporations both play a role in the transmission of monetary policy. Our analysis shows that some of the differences across countries could be related to the degree of integration and development of the respective financial systems. It should be emphasised, however, that the significant changes that have occurred in the financial sector since the start of Monetary Union have increased the choice of financial products and available finance, generating tangible benefits for households and non-financial enterprises. Overall, we can conclude that the process of financial market integration that is underway, while not yet complete, is conducive to the smooth transmission of monetary policy across the euro area. Nevertheless, greater financial market integration could eliminate some of the remaining differences and therefore facilitate further the transmission of the single monetary policy within the euro area. 2 BIS Review 31/2007 
The second special feature, “Strengthening the EU framework for cross-border banks”, focuses on the importance of cross-border banking in fostering integration in the banking sector. While cross-border banking is first and foremost a market-driven process, the public sector can play an significant role by providing a policy framework that is adequate to support cross-border activities. This special feature provides an overview of recent developments in cross-border banking in the euro area and reviews the related EU policy framework. A number of indicators point to an increased degree of cross-border banking activities in the euro area, such as the growing cross-border share in the financial holdings of banks, the increasing cross-border mergers & acquisitions, and the rising market share of major cross-border banking groups.  In this context, it is also important that the EU policy framework ensures equal market access and supports the efficient operation of banks across countries.  Various prudential, legal and fiscal measures to strengthen the EU framework for cross-border banking have already been adopted or are currently under preparation. The special feature briefly reviews these measures and provides an overview of the efforts to enhance convergence and cooperation in the supervision of cross-border banks. According to our assessment the EU supervisory arrangements have already been substantially enhanced by two significant measures: the introduction of the Lamfalussy approach in the banking sector and the adoption of the revised regulatory framework for home-host country interaction under the Capital Requirements Directive. Additionally, several initiatives are underway to ensure that the benefits of this improved institutional setting can be fully reaped and various EU fora monitor the progress made in this field. At the same time, some discussion has emerged on whether or not it may be beneficial to move over time towards more integrated supervisory arrangements. Our analysis concludes that the findings of the broad-based review of the EU supervisory framework by the end of this year will permit the evaluation of the overall functioning of the institutional arrangements and an assessment of whether there is a need for further action. The third special feature, “The Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) and its implications for financial integration”, considers the European banking industry’s initiative to enhance the integration of retail payment systems in Europe. The Eurosystem supports this initiative and acts as a catalyst. The introduction of a single retail payment system is the natural complement to the introduction of the euro banknotes and coins and it is a necessary step towards the further integration of the retail payment market. The aim of the SEPA project is to enable customers to make more efficient cashless payments throughout the euro area from a single account, irrespective of their location. SEPA will, in particular, define the technical standards and access conditions to the market. By creating a level playing-field, SEPA will ensure that participants are treated equally. This special feature concludes that, while the banking industry has made substantial progress towards a more integrated retail payment market, committing itself to introducing SEPA instruments and procedures from January 2008 and to migrating a critical mass of its customer payments by end-2010, some issues, such as transparency and interoperability, still need to be finalised. II.3 Eurosystem activities for financial integration The report’s third chapter, “Eurosystem activities for financial integration”, provides an overview of the main Eurosystem activities in 2006. This chapter shows that the ECB and the whole Eurosystem contribute in a number of ways to financial integration and development, building on their expertise and special nature as public institutions which are both active in the market and have intense relationships with market participants. We generally distinguish four activities in this contribution: (i) giving advice on the legislative and regulatory framework for the financial system and direct rule-making; (ii) acting as a catalyst for private sector activities; (iii) enhancing knowledge, raising awareness and monitoring the state of European financial integration; and (iv) providing central bank services that also foster European financial integration. I will now provide an example of each of these four activities. With respect to the shaping of the financial system’s legislative and regulatory framework, I would like to mention, as an example, the EU securities clearing and settlement infrastructure. Its current BIS Review 31/2007 3 
fragmentation represents a major obstacle to the further integration of European securities markets. Greater integration of securities clearing and settlement systems will be crucial to lowering the post-trading costs of cross-border securities transactions, to exploiting the potential economies of scale and to establishing a European level playing-field. Moreover, the clearing and settlement infrastructure directly affects the performance of the major tasks of the ECB, pertaining to the implementation of its monetary policy via the framework for the collateralisation of monetary policy (and intraday credit) operations, the safeguarding of financial stability and the promotion of the smooth operation of payment systems. Several public sector initiatives aim to achieve an efficient, safe and integrated post-trading market infrastructure in the European Union. The ECB is closely involved in this work through its participation in the Clearing and Settlement Advisory and Monitoring Expert Group (CESAME) and in the Legal Certainty Group. Let me also mention here – as an important development in 2006 – that, at the European Commission’s request, the European industry associations for exchanges and post-trading infrastructures and their members signed a “European Code of Conduct for Clearing and Settlement” last November. The ECB also participates in the related Monitoring Group that is chaired by the Commission. I now turn to the function that we describe as “acting as a catalyst for private sector activities”. By this we mean that in areas such as standard-setting and the establishment of common infrastructures, cooperation between private agents of the financial sector is as necessary as competition. However, cooperation may fail to materialise without the support of a catalyst. The ECB and the entire Eurosystem can play such a role, on account of the competence and objectivity and the numerous contacts with market participants. The Short-Term European Paper (STEP) initiative promotes the development of a pan-European short-term paper market through market players’ voluntary compliance with a core set of standards encompassed in the STEP Market Convention. This Convention was signed on 9 June 2006. Since then, 32 STEP-compliant programmes, amounting to EUR 166 billion, have been launched under the STEP label.  The ECB has supported the STEP initiative since its inception in 2001. During the preparatory phase, the ECB facilitated coordination among market players, contributed to the STEP Task Force of the Financial Markets Association ACI and provided legal assistance. The Eurosystem’s ongoing contribution to the STEP market focuses on two main activities. First, until June 2008, the ECB and nine of the Eurosystem’s NCBs will provide technical assistance to the STEP Secretariat concerning the STEP labelling process, whereby the ultimate responsibility for granting and withdrawing the STEP label fully rests with the STEP Secretariat. Second, the ECB regularly produces statistics on yields and volumes in the STEP market and publishes them on its website. From next week onwards, daily statistics will be made available. Following the publication of these yield statistics, the STEP market will be accepted as a non-regulated market for collateral purposes in Eurosystem credit operations.  Turning to research and monitoring activities, I would like to mention the ECB-CFS Research Network on “Capital Markets and Financial Integration in Europe”, which was set up in 2002 by the ECB and the Centre for Financial Studies in Frankfurt. The current research focuses on three areas: (i) the relationship between financial integration and financial stability; (ii) EU accession, financial development and financial integration; and (iii) financial system modernisation and economic growth in Europe. The network has organised a series of conferences attended by academics, market participants and policymakers, such as the one hosted in September 2006 by the Deutsche Bundesbank entitled “Financial System Modernisation and Economic Growth”. Furthermore, I would like to mention that, every year, the network awards five “Lamfalussy fellowships” to promising young researchers who undertake projects in the field of financial integration. Finally, with respect to the provision of central banking services that are also conducive to financial integration, as an example I choose our wholesale payment system, TARGET and its further development into TARGET2. After the rapid integration of the euro area money markets, which was closely related to the establishment of the TARGET system, the planned launch of the single technical platform, TARGET2, later this year will promote further integration in the financial markets affected. This will be achieved, in particular, through a harmonised service level, a single price structure, and a harmonised set of cash settlement services in central bank money for all “ancillary” systems, such as retail payment systems, clearing houses and securities settlement systems.  4 BIS Review 31/2007 
In November 2006 the Eurosystem published its third progress report on TARGET2, informing market participants about the Eurosystem’s decisions on pricing and legal issues, contingency procedures, and testing and migration activities. The report also confirmed that 19 November 2007 would be the starting date for TARGET2.  With a view to maximising the benefits from the establishment of TARGET2, the Eurosystem started in 2006 to explore the possibility of providing settlement services in central bank money for securities transactions in euro. The objective of the new service – the so-called TARGET2-Securities (T2S) project – is to harmonise the settlement of securities transactions and, ultimately, to process both securities and cash settlements on a single platform through common procedures. In early March of this year, the Governing Council concluded that it is feasible to implement TARGET2-Securities on the basis of a detailed feasibility study and a blueprint – both of which have since been published on our website. We therefore decided to go ahead with the next phase of the project, namely the definition of user requirements on the basis of market contributions. The scope of the project will be determined by taking into account the results of a public consultation. The Governing Council will then decide on the subsequent development phase by early 2008. III.  Conclusion This brings me to the end of my presentation and I would like to conclude with the following remarks.  From my presentation, you may have noticed the many different facets that, together, contribute to financial integration and shape the European financial system. Since central banks are at the core of financial systems, they closely follow developments which can foster their integration. The ECB and the entire Eurosystem devote a substantial amount of resources to this task because we are convinced that this is an important area of progress for the European economy, within the framework established by the Lisbon agenda. Indeed the progress made so far towards the integration and development of the European financial system is a European achievement, and the creation of the euro has made a decisive contribution. Finally, I should also like to stress that, while financial integration is an important driver for increasing the efficiency of a financial system, financial efficiency also depends on other factors. Among those are the degree of financial development and the quality of the fundamental determinants of the framework conditions of the financial market, such as the efficiency of the legal system. To capture more aspects of financial efficiency, we envisage widening the report’s scope over time in order to encompass such factors as well. I am now at your disposal for questions.

Ernesto Gouveia Gove: The challenges in extending financial services throughout Mozambique Speech by Mr Ernesto Gouveia Gove, Governor of the Bank of Mozambique, on the occasion of the XXXI Consultative Council, Nampula, 26 January 2007. *      *      * Honourable Governor of Nampula Province Excellency Honourable President of Nampula City Council Excellency Distinct Former Governors of the Banco de Moçambique, Dr. SérgioVieira, Dr. Prakash Ratilal, Dr. Eneas Comiche and Dr. Adriano Maleiane Dear President of the National Institute of Statistics Dear Representatives of Niassa Provincial Government Dear members of the Board of Directors of the BM Dear representatives of the Financial Institutions Dear Guests Ladies and Gentlemen First of all, I would like to express, on behalf of the Board of Directors and the employees of the Banco de Moçambique and personally, our satisfaction and gratitude for having accepted the invitation for a joint reflection on a current topic of our economy. Your presence in this conference room is of indubitable meaning, since it shows the sympathy and commitment towards the common problems we face in our country and particularly in the financial system, whose solution overcomes the simple will of each of us. Allow me to refer in a special way to the presence of the Former Governors of the Banco de Moçambique, personalities whose leadership and competence marked, at its time, the nearly three decades of the history of our institution. I would also like to take this opportunity also to express the profound regard of the Banco de Moçambique to all the banking institutions that operate in our market, the private and public financial institutions, the public in general and to all the international community, for all the support they have provided to elevate the financial system, contributing to the development of the economy and reduction of absolute poverty in the country. This is the second day of our XXXI Consultative Council. In yesterday’s session, besides the analysis of the implementation of the Recommendations of the XXX Consultative Council, we analysed the execution of our Strategic Plan, the report on human resources, titled “Balanço Social do Banco” and yet we discussed other important domestic matters, and stressed the relevant role of the colleagues who retired last year. Ladies and Gentlemen The recent history regarding the evolution of our financial system shows notable development and growth in terms of the number of institutions, diversification and modernization of products, thanks to the market opening to private financial institutions in the sequence of financial and economic reforms began in the 80’s, and which witnessed great move as from 1990. In effect, of a total of three banks and one insurance company that the country had in 1987, currently the number has moved to a total of (12) twelve banks, 11 (eleven) credit cooperatives, 56 (fifty-six) micro-finance institutions, besides 4 (four) insurance and leasing companies and others, as well as a notable implementation of electronic systems of international standards. However, this development is characterized by a tendency towards the concentration of institutions and financial services in the main cities of the country, situation that became worse with the closing of BIS Review 30/2007 1 
some branches in the rural areas, creating within the authorities and in the society in general, a great concern, given that it is in these areas where the majority of our population is concentrated. In fact, the numbers show that the 228 (two hundred and twenty-eight) bank branches existing in the country only cover 28 (twenty-eight) districts, which means that the remainder 100 (one hundred) districts, which comprise about 79% of the national territory, do not possess any banking representation, in other words, a vast group of people are deprived of financial services. The disproportions are still more evident if we consider that the three main cities of the country, Maputo, Beira and Nampula, have altogether 132 (one hundred and thirty-two) branches, that is, 58% of the total branches, of which Maputo city, alone, absorbs about 45%. In Maputo City, for example, each branch serves 11,592 inhabitants, while in Milange and Angoche, the coverage is of 411,267 and 258,594 inhabitants, respectively. Analysing the prevailing situation in another perspective, it is concluded that in Maputo city there is a branch in each 2.85 square kilometres against 15,871 square kilometres in Montepuez and 14,150 square kilometres in Mueda, which shows the long way still to be pursued. With regard to other kinds of services and financial products, namely ATM’s (Automated Teller Machines) and POS (Point of Sale) devices, it is concluded that there are differences provided that they are also concentrated in Maputo (Province and City), as they represent 69% of the total national coverage. In order to invert the situation, the authorities have devised a number of legal and regulating measures aimed at promoting micro finance, on one side and, on the other side, the establishment of banks through to the areas of the country with minor financial services. Similarly, it is worth referring that the Government, in the context of its Five-Year Term Program, has been undertaking efforts in order to create conditions in terms of infrastructures, namely, roads, bridges, telecommunications and electric power network. We are conscious that, even though, there are constraints that should be cleared, but this is the real country we have and under which we should work, being necessary to continue seeking innovative ideas in order to face the current and future challenges. The view that the authorities have about the expansion of financial intermediation is that it cannot only be confined to the physical presence of bank branches in rural areas. It should be done in a broad and integrated way, making use of the advantages offered by the information technology systems. We need to find an adequate combination between the traditional and electronic banking, maximizing the use of products such as ATM’s, POS, Internet banking and mobile banking. In this engineering, the mailing services can and should be asked to play an important role as bank correspondents, making savings on their behalf and responsibility and rendering other kind of financial services. The principal idea is that the financial sector must also associate itself clearly to the efforts of the Government and other economic agents, as well as the society in general, towards the accomplishment of the major objective of creating wealth in order to eradicate poverty in the country. Ladies and Gentlemen The objective of expanding banking institutions and financial services through to the rural areas is in line with the Government strategy, which defines district as the pole of planning and development of our economy. We are certain that these two factors will interact contributing towards the same purpose, taking into account that, for the growth of districts, it will be necessary to continue to endow them with financial and human resources as well as infrastructures, similarly important for the financial sector to flourish. At the micro-finance level, we should stress the valuable contribution given by the authorities through the Micro-finance Support Program, which aims specifically at expanding micro-finance activities through to the rural areas. There are experiences of countries with characteristics like ours, which confirm to be possible for the financial system to serve as the encouraging factor for development of economic and financially poor regions. Countries like Ghana, Kenya and Nigeria, for instance, can serve, at the level of our continent, as the source of inspiration in the process of promotion and development of micro-finance institutions. 2 BIS Review 30/2007 
Although the cases of relative failure observed since the 70s until the present days are not at all to be neglected, in the micro-finance domain, however, we have to note that Asia is a continent replete with successful experiences. With respect to cases of success, three institutions deserve relevance for their contribution in the fight against poverty in their respective countries: The Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives, (BAAC), of Thailand founded in 1966, the “BRI Unit Desa” System of the Bank Rakyat of Indonesia (BRI-UD), founded in 1984 and the Grameen Bank (GB) of Bangladesh created in 1983, which today hold a portfolio of savers to the tune of 4.4, 14.5 and 2.1 million, respectively. The history of Grameen Bank is very simple, but very rich in terms of learning aspects. Its founder, Mr Mohammad Yunus, began his activity as money lender, granting loans to 42 poor people who needed an individual amount equivalent to USD 27. That was in this way that everything started for the case, which today is the world reference in the field. The success obtained in terms of the fight against poverty and the increased potential of business in the areas where he operated, encouraged him to create a rural bank. Besides the information I referred to, recent data pointed out that today the bank employs 18,796 workers, and holds a portfolio of 6.61 million loan beneficiary clients, of which 97% are women and, a network of 2,226 branches. Mohammad Yunus and the Grammen Bank were awarded the 2006 Peace Nobel Prize, thanks to their devotion to the cause of the more needed population of their country. It is not possible to ensure social and political stability with high poverty indices the reason why the fight against it is a priority that cannot be postponed. Besides, recognising this fact, the Norwegian Committee of Nobel Prize supported its decision to award the prize in the following terms: “The long lasting Peace cannot be achieved without opening a way so that a large number of people is poverty free” end of quotation. It was considering all the potential financial intermediation for economic growth that, in the present year, we chose for debate in our XXXI Consultative Council the topic: Bancarização da Economia – Extensão dos Serviços Financeiros para as zonas Rurais, (Banking the Economy – Expanding Financial Services to the Rural Areas), believing it to be a current matter of national interest and importance for our reality where the district was assumed as the pole of development. Ladies and Gentlemen The hosting of our Consultative Council here in Nampula is a sign especially addressed to financial institutions and operators, to show that we should expand our activities beyond the Capital city. And for that reason we are grateful for the presence in this session of the Governor of Nampula Province and other representatives of the north region provinces. We are conscious that the attainment of the will for greater expansion of financial services throughout the national territory requires the intervention, with appropriate measures, by several interested parts: the Government, the private sector, and ourselves – Banco de Moçambique! Our strategy of reinforcing the level of expansion of banking institutions throughout the country, facilitating and encouraging the enlargement of financial services, had an important landmark with the process already underway, which consists of opening five branches of the Banco de Moçambique in similar number of Provinces. Until now branches have been inaugurated in Quelimane and Maxixe cities, with plans to open Pemba branch next week. This process will come to the end with the inauguration of branches in Lichinga and Tete by the end of the first semester of 2007. The Banco de Moçambique territorial expansion is within the performance of its role as central bank, namely, as the authority of the national payment systems, supervisor of institutions, issuing bank, and manager of money circulation. Therefore, we are conscious that the branches will facilitate our mission and will contribute to the (i) reduction of storing costs and transport of banknotes and coins by commercial banks, (ii) intermediation of Government financial operations (iii) deposits and withdrawal of banknotes and coins of the Metical by the banking system, (iv) licensing of foreign exchange operations and (v) support and supervision of micro-finance institutions. The urgency in expanding banking institutions throughout the country becomes similarly relevant in the context of regional economic integration programs underway within the SADC, as well as in the African continent. The creation of a single SADC central bank, and later an African central bank, will require a sound, modern financial system, with territorial coverage, otherwise institutions of other BIS Review 30/2007 3 
member countries of the region will reach this segment of the market rapidly, which is presently ignored by the domestic financial service network. Ladies and Gentlemen We are certain that in the current conditions, the enlargement of financial services to less favoured areas of the country, requires the provision of a number of non banking external factors as well as fiscal and non fiscal incentives. Therefore, bringing into debate a package of measures aimed at encouraging the enlargement of financial services throughout the country, we intend to get contributions from representatives of various transversal areas herein represented so that we can improve further the referred project with the purpose of ensuring the adoption of more effective actions that stimulate investments for the expansion and extension of financial services in Mozambique as quickly as possible, increasing the financial intermediation. We are not eluded in relation to the challenges we have forward, including in the macroeconomic plan, provided that stability is an essential element for investments in the context of more banking institutions throughout the country to take place effectively. We ended 2006 with a considerable reduction of inflation and the data we have been monitoring in 2007 suggest the continuous reduction and control of inflation. In the same way, with respect to the trend of the Metical exchange rate in relation to the USD, available data pointed out to a greater stability in 2007, in an environment of greater convergence between the USD rates in different segments of our foreign exchange market. These data show a scenario that encourages us to review some of the monetary policy instruments managed by the Banco de Moçambique. In this context, during February, we will reduce the Mandatory Reserve rate that the banking institutions should constitute at the Banco de Moçambique, and we will accommodate its regime of constitution in line with our objectives of a major deepening of money market operations and a major financial intermediation in the country. Ladies and Gentlemen Before I finish, I would like to express my gratitude to all those who, in a devoted and patriotic way, involved themselves in the process of introduction of the Metical of the New Family, integrating various working committees, or travelling throughout this country from Maputo to Rovuma and from Indico to Zumbo, visiting villages, towns, districts and Provinces, carrying out the heroic mission of informing our population of the importance and objectives behind this process. The mission is not yet finished, but it is not fairly a lack of modesty if we assert that the process was successful, taking into account similar experiences we have heard of. In this final stage of the process, I would like to urge, particularly, the economic agents involved in the commercialization campagins, in rural shops and all the institutions whose activity runs in the countryside, to serve as catalyst agents of the exchange process, using banknotes and coins of the Metical of the New Family in all transactions held with the public in order for about 6% to 7% of the remainder former families of the Metical to be changed in short time and within a peaceful environment. To end, I would like to invite everyone to participate in the debate, in a frank and open way, expressing your opinions and experiences on the challenges of expanding banking institutions and extending financial services through to the rural areas. Thank you very much. 4 BIS Review 30/2007 
Radovan Jelašić: Achieving a stable currency for a healthy Serbian economy Speech by Mr Radovan Jelašić, Governor of the National Bank of Serbia, at Roundtable on “Stable Currency for a Healthy Economy”, Belgrade, 16 February 2007. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen, Mr Yves Thibault de Silguy, The role of the National Bank of Serbia is well defined by the Law adopted in mid-2003, maybe because that particular point was copied from EU Treaty provisions on the European Central Bank. The definition reads as follows: “The primary objective of the NBS shall be to achieve and maintain price stability. In addition to its primary objective, the NBS shall also pursue the objective of financial stability. Without prejudice to its primary objective, the NBS shall support the economic policy of the Government of the Republic of Serbia, acting in accordance with the principle of a market economy.” Hence, the Law clearly defines the main objective – “to achieve and maintain price stability” – and says nothing about growth, employment, exports, wages, roads, etc... The reason why almost all developed countries adopted this law – and why we thankfully copied it – is simple enough: there is nothing that contributes more to growth and economic development, higher employment and growth in exports than stability of prices. This assertion has been proved right in all developed countries in the course of the last two decades. All other arguments remind me of stories from 1860s when Prince Mihailo reigned in Serbia and people were debating, believe it or not, whether Serbia needed railroads. The comments were like: “Foreign machines, foreign machine drivers, foreign managers, and all of it at our expense." And, while there is a clearly defined objective that we as a central bank need to achieve, the means for achieving it are not strictly specified – though in Serbia, like in other countries of the region, it is often much more important to find a good excuse than to face reality. In simple words, the law clearly defines our assignment without delineating the means to realize it! “Experts” in Serbia still engage in theoretical discussions about monetary policy while, at the same time, thinking in terms of exchange rate only! The facts relating to the exchange rate, however, show that the role of the NBS in setting the exchange rate was never as insignificant as in 2006 while the volume of interbank trade in foreign exchange was never more vigorous than last year – increasing by as much as 189%. Of course, we still have a long way to go to achieve a fully market-determined exchange rate, like for example Switzerland, but we are on the right track and we are getting there fast! We need a) a still deeper forex market, b) buyers and sellers who engage in forward trade and have abandoned the "euro costs what it costs" principle, c) exchange dealers who trade exclusively with banks. Moreover, after the first two weeks this year when, as we had expected, demand for foreign currency went up substantially, the NBS intervened in the Interbank Foreign Exchange Market session on one day only. Do we need another proof that the exchange rate is freely formed? Last year's inflation of 6.5% in Serbia matches the level achieved by its neighbours. To illustrate, by applying the foreign exchange regime of the currency board, Bulgaria recorded 6.5% also, Bosnia 6.0%, while Hungary reached 6.5% and Romania 4.9%. Building on this, and primarily on the low inflation recorded in the final quarter of 2006, in 2007 the National Bank of Serbia will target the lower band of the 4-8% core inflation corridor, set already in August 2006. Let us now note the role of the monetary policy. Last year was a key year for Serbia, as it was finally recognized that monetary policy represents a significant and powerful tool whose importance cannot be overstated! This is a very important point to make, especially in Serbia, where I can in all honesty say this is the first time a modern and proper monetary policy has been pursued! I find it quite normal and understandable that a person may come up to me in the streets of Čačak, Novi Sad or Belgrade and ask me why the National Bank of Serbia has only one objective and why this objective is “to achieve and maintain price stability” and not “to achieve growth and development, higher employment rates, exports, etc,” or why it is that the NBS needs to sterilize excess money and how it finances this sterilization. But when such questions are raised by “economists” and “experts” – well, that is a cause for much concern! I get the feeling that these people are trying to ignore a very valuable experience from the 1970s and 1980s. Many experts seem to have slept through the past 20 years – but the economic science has been developing regardless! Experiences from that time were well summarized BIS Review 30/2007 1 
at a conference in Budapest about a month ago, on 19 January 2007, by Jacques de Larosière, former Managing Director of the IMF and EBRD President and former Governor of the Banque de France: Stage one: Before the 1980s, governments were convinced that there was a trade off between “a little more inflation” and less unemployment. This policy eventually led to double digit inflation in advanced economies and galloping inflation in a number of developing countries. High inflation was finally recognized as inimical to growth and socially disruptive. In 1979-1980, the game of systematically seeking employment at the expense of price stability came to an end. The whole process had entailed high economic and social costs; Stage two: In 1980s and 1990s, monetary policy managed to reduce inflation. Most central banks were gradually made independent from governments and acquired new credibility. This was the period of the triumph of central bankers. US inflation came down from 13% in 1979-1980 to 2.2% in 1999.” Inflation has been a part of our lives for the last thirty years and it has become practically impossible to imagine living without it. It is always on our minds – when buying things or planning our future, when borrowing or giving presents – and it would feel strange not to count with the increase in prices! Because it has been with us for over 3 decades, an abnormal situation has become normal and it is now feels abnormal that there is no inflation. True, if there is inflation, it is easier to do the budgeting, to plan, to breathe, etc. because if your prices are changing all the time and your exchange rate is unstable, you will never really be comparable with the rest of the world, as today’s calculation will simply not apply tomorrow, let alone the day after. The same is true of my role as the NBS Governor: my job would be far easier if I chose to cover up my own and the institution’s inefficiency by means of inflation and currency depreciation. But times are changing, for, let me remind you, Serbia is still in the process of transition and it will take some time yet to complete! If nothing else, the stability of prices and currency has at least impelled many to come up with much more creative “explanations” for price rises. Only a year ago, the increase in prices of milk, cable TV and public transport services was blamed on the exchange rate… In the course of the past year, the NBS created a stable economic environment and successfully slashed inflation, forcing the Government and policy makers to face the reality. And the reality is unyielding: inflation does not create jobs, it does not push GDP up, and, perhaps most importantly, inflation has not created welfare anywhere in the world! Is it then possible that, even after the devastating consequences of the 1992-1993 hyperinflation on the country’s economy, Serbia has still not grasped how damaging the effects of inflation can be? 2 BIS Review 30/2007 
Timothy F Geithner: Credit markets innovations and their implications  Remarks by Mr Timothy F Geithner, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, at the 2007 Credit Markets Symposium hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Charlotte, North Carolina, 23 March 2007. *      *      * I am grateful to Jeff Lacker for including me in this conference, and my compliments to him and the Richmond Fed for bringing together an excellent group to discuss the implications of recent innovations in credit markets. The past few years have seen remarkable changes in credit markets, and this is a good time to take stock of what we know about those developments and their implications. The latest wave of credit market innovations has elicited some concerns about their implications for the stability of the financial system, concerns similar to those associated with earlier periods of rapid change in financial markets. Will the most recent credit market innovations amplify credit cycles, contributing to "excessive" lending in times of relative stability, and then magnify the contraction in credit that follows? Will they introduce greater volatility in financial markets? Will they create greater risk of systemic financial crisis? These concerns have been heightened in some quarters by the problems currently being experienced in the subprime mortgage sector. It will take some time before the full implications are understood and the full impact can be assessed. As of now, though, there are few signs that the disruptions in this one sector of the credit markets will have a lasting impact on credit markets as a whole. Indeed, economic theory and recent practical experience offer some reassurance against both these specific concerns and more general worries about the implications of credit market innovations for the performance of the financial system. The rapid growth in these new types of credit instruments is, of course, a sign of their value to market participants. For borrowers, credit market innovation offers the prospect of increased credit supply; better pricing; and a relaxation of financial constraints. For investors, new credit instruments bring the prospect of broader risk and return opportunities; the ability to diversify portfolios; and increased flexibility. And for lenders, innovations can help free up funding and capital for other uses; they can help improve credit risk and asset/liability management; and they can improve the return on capital and provide new and cheaper funding sources. By spreading risk more broadly, providing opportunities to manage and hedge risk, and making it possible to trade and price credit risk, credit market innovation should help make markets both more efficient and more resilient. They should help make markets better able to allocate capital to its highest return and better able to absorb stress. Broad, deep and well-functioning capital markets complemented by strong, well-capitalized banks, able to provide liquidity in times of strain, make for a more efficient financial system: one which contributes to better economic growth outcomes over time. There are therefore compelling arguments in favor of a generally positive assessment of the consequences of innovation. Does experience provide support for these arguments, or are these changes too new for us to know? The recent changes in credit markets have been dramatic. We have seen rapid growth of structured credit products, credit default swaps and new types of collateralized debt and loan obligations. Although these instruments are very new, they are the natural extension of earlier innovations in credit markets. Over a long period we have seen innovations ranging from the syndication of bank loans and the direct provision of credit through the capital markets, to the spread of asset-backed securities and products that separate different parts of the payments stream and different dimensions of the risk in a credit obligation into different instruments. These changes have contributed to a substantial reduction in the share of total credit held by banks. They have produced a greater separation or distance between the entity that first arranges a loan and those who end up holding the risk, and more intermediaries in that chain. And they have contributed to a dramatic increase in the number and diversity of creditors to any individual borrower, and a greater capacity to actively trade credit risk. BIS Review 29/2007 1 
We are now well into the third decade of experience with the consequences of these earlier innovations, and this history offers some useful lessons for evaluating the probable impact of the latest changes in credit markets. The ease with which the U.S. financial system absorbed the substantial scale of corporate defaults that peaked in recent years in 2002 provides some support for the argument that broader and deeper capital markets make the system more resilient. In general, there does not seem to be strong empirical support for the proposition that derivatives increase volatility in financial markets. Volatility is not higher where derivatives are most prevalent. Credit market innovation does not appear to have resulted in a large increase in leverage in the corporate sector, as some had feared. Indeed, nonfinancial corporate leverage in the United States is currently low by recent historical standards. The overall degree of balance sheet leverage by corporations, for example, is higher in some more traditional financial systems than it is in systems where credit market innovations are more advanced. Default rates do not appear to have risen, nor recovery rates fallen as these credit innovations have spread, despite concerns they might lead to excess lending, the mis-pricing of credit risk and more messy and more complicated workouts, resulting from the greater diffusion of the investor base. And although the sources of the broad moderation in GDP volatility observed in the United States over the past two decades are still the subject of debate, the fact that this moderation occurred during a period of extensive innovation in credit and other financial markets should provide some comfort for those who expected the opposite. Innovations in credit markets are inevitably accompanied by challenges. Indeed, the history of innovation in financial markets provides many examples of periods of rapid change accompanied by fraud and abuse, by challenges in assessing value and risk, by concerns about the adequacy of investor and consumer protection, and by unexpected behavior of prices, defaults and correlations. To some degree, these types of problems are the inevitable consequence of change and innovation. Although recent experience as well as theory provide some reassurance against the concern that credit market innovation would make markets more volatile and the financial system more vulnerable, these judgments require qualification. Some aspects of this latest wave of innovation are different in substance – therefore potentially in their implications – from their predecessors. And these differences require attention. There are three aspects of the latest set of changes which I think deserve more reflection. The first is about the role of market liquidity and liquidity risk in how credit markets work. Credit market innovations have transformed the financial system from one in which most credit risk is in the form of loans, held to maturity on the balance sheets of banks, to a system in which most credit risk now takes an incredibly diverse array of different forms, much of it held by nonbank financial institutions that mark to market and can take on substantial leverage. U.S. financial institutions now hold only around 15 percent of total credit outstanding by the nonfarm nonfinancial sector: that is less than half the level of two decades ago. For the largest U.S. banks, credit exposures in over-the-counter derivatives is approaching the level of more traditional forms of credit exposure. Hedge funds, according to one recent survey, account for 58 percent of the volume in credit derivatives in the year to the first quarter of 2006. Financial shocks take many forms. Some, such as in 1987 and 1998, involve a sharp increase in risk premia that precipitate a fall in asset prices and that in turn leads to what economists and engineers call "positive feedback" dynamics. As firms and investors move to hedge against future losses and to raise money to meet margin calls, the brake becomes the accelerator: markets come under additional pressure, pushing asset prices lower. Volatility increases. Liquidity in markets for more risky assets falls. In systems where credit is more market-based and more credit risk is in leveraged financial institutions outside the banking system, a sharp rise in asset-price volatility and the concomitant reduction in market liquidity, can potentially have greater negative effects on credit markets. If losses in these institutions force them to withdraw from credit markets, credit availability will decline, unless or until other institutions in a stronger financial position are willing to step in. The greater connection between asset-price volatility, market liquidity and the credit mechanism is the necessary consequence of a system in which credit risk is dispersed outside the banking system, including among leveraged funds. 2 BIS Review 29/2007 
This does not make the system less stable, though, only different. For if risk is spread more broadly, shocks should be absorbed with less trauma. Moreover, the system as a whole may be less vulnerable to distortions introduced by the moral hazard associated with the access that banks have to the safety net. A second issue we need to consider stems from the complexity of the new credit instruments, the challenges they present in terms of valuation and risk measurement and their short history of experience in times of stress. Even the most sophisticated participants in the markets for these instruments find the risk management challenges associated with these instruments daunting. This raises the prospect of unanticipated losses. Default rates are harder to predict where there has been a substantial change in the financial attributes of borrowers. The prices of instruments may not respond as expected to a given change in losses or in the value of the assets underlying these instruments. Hedging strategies may prove to be less effective than expected. Similarly rated instruments can behave very differently in stress events. The response of prices and volatility to the downgrades in the automobile sector in the spring of 2005 and the recent experience in subprime mortgages and related asset-backed securities and credit derivatives illustrate different types of surprises faced by the participants in these markets. They are a reminder of the dimensions of uncertainty that exist about the shape of the distribution of potential returns. This is particularly true of what we might call the adverse tail, or the negative extreme. These challenges exist for all participants in these markets: for the institutions that underwrite, structure and distribute these risks; for those who trade or hold them; and for third parties, like the rating agencies. These challenges of complexity are significant as well because they can exacerbate the problem of dealing with classic principal-agent problems. You can see this in the subprime mortgage market where, for example, a person may be rewarded for generating new mortgages on the basis of volume, without being directly exposed to the consequences of default; but these problems exist wherever incentives diverge and contracting is imperfect. Financial institutions typically maintain a range of different checks and balances to deal with the risk of misaligned incentives: for example, between a trader and the principal whose resources are at risk, or between the mortgage broker or underwriter and the firm that ultimately ends up holding the risk. But these checks and balances depend in part on the capacity of risk managers to observe and understand the underlying economic risk in these instruments. Where that is harder because of this combination of complexity, imbedded leverage, and short loss history, then market discipline will be weaker. A third issue relates to the dynamics of failure and the infrastructure that supports these markets. The dramatic growth in the volume of over-the-counter derivatives and the growth in the number and size of leveraged funds inevitably complicate the resolution of the failure of a large financial institution that is active in these markets. The sheer number of financial contracts that would have to be unraveled in the context of a default, the challenge that a former colleague of mine likes to refer to as "unscrambling the eggs," could exacerbate and prolong uncertainty, and complicate the process of resolution. As is typical during periods of rapid innovation, these markets grew much more quickly than did the supporting infrastructure. Take credit derivatives, for example. For most of the early years of this market, much of the post-trade processing system was not automated and required substantial manual intervention. Positions were assigned without the knowledge of counterparties. Confirmations backlogs rose to very high levels. As Alan Greenspan put it, the market was using 19th century methods of dealing with 21st century financial instruments. This created a greater risk of operational problems and uncertainty about exposures in the event of stress. The capacity of market participants to mitigate these risks by improving the infrastructure was hampered by classic collective action problems, magnified by the greater number and diversity of participants. All these challenges merit attention. They describe some of the risks that have accompanied the substantial benefits of credit market innovation. And they help illustrate why these broad changes in financial markets may have contributed to a system where the probability of a major crisis seems likely to be lower, but the losses associated with such a crisis may be greater or harder to mitigate. What should policymakers to do mitigate these risks? BIS Review 29/2007 3 
We cannot turn back the clock on innovation or reverse the increase in complexity around risk management. We do not have the capacity to monitor or control concentrations of leverage or risk outside the banking system. We cannot identify the likely sources of future stress to the system, and act preemptively to diffuse them. The most productive focus of policy attention has to be on improving the shock absorbers in the core of the financial system, in terms of capital and liquidity relative to risk and the robustness of the infrastructure. These issues are the principal focus of day-to-day supervision and market oversight in the major financial centers around the world. The Federal Reserve is actively involved in a range of efforts, working closely with the primary supervisors of the major global financial institutions and the critical parts of the financial infrastructure, to encourage further progress. In this context, we are working to put in place a stronger regulatory capital regime and to strengthen the capacity of firms to absorb losses in stress conditions. We are encouraging more sophisticated and more conservative management of credit exposures in over-the-counter derivatives and structured financial products, as well as of exposures to hedge funds. And we are encouraging a range of efforts to modernize the operational infrastructure that underpins the over-the-counter derivatives markets, and to improve the capacity of market participants to manage a major default. The stronger these shock absorbers, the more resilient markets will be in the face of future shocks, and the more confident we can be that banks will be a source of strength and of liquidity to markets in periods of stress and that the financial system will contribute to improved economic performance over time. Thank you. 4 BIS Review 29/2007 
John Gieve: The City’s growth – the crest of a wave or swimming with the stream? Speech by Sir John Gieve, Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, to the London Society of Chartered Accountants, Bank of England, London, 26 March 2007. *      *      * Introduction Over the past few months there has been renewed talk of London overtaking New York as the world’s leading financial centre. And it has reflected fears in the US as much as self congratulation in this country. We should take some of this with a pinch of salt. Talk of an external threat may be helpful to those building a case for change in the US financial system. The US market remains the biggest in the world by many measures. More fundamentally this is not a zero sum game. Even if London establishes a comparative advantage and gains market share, New York (and Paris and Edinburgh for that matter) can prosper too. Yet something interesting is going on. The report by McKinseys commissioned by Mayor Bloomberg concluded that “London is transforming itself into an increasingly sizeable and attractive talent hub for people with … skills that used to be available only in New York …” and “… superior conditions for innovation, capital formation, risk management and investment in these markets [derivatives and debt financing] are beginning to emerge (or have already done so) in London, which is building momentum relative to New York”.1  On this side of the pond too, the growth of financial markets in the City is attracting more attention. While much of that is favourable, we have seen renewed worries that London’s prominence and the wealth it attracts and generates may be distorting the broader economy possibly adding to social tensions – that it may be more a cuckoo in the nest than a golden goose. So the future of the City is a significant issue not just for Londoners but for the development of the wider British economy. And the development of the financial sector is of particular interest to the Bank not just because it is an important part of the economy itself but because it shapes the way that our monetary policy impacts on the wider economy and because of our responsibility with the FSA and Treasury for maintaining the stability of the financial system. I will be speaking about the impact of the City’s rapid growth on the broader economy in coming months but today I want to focus on what underlies that growth and, therefore, to address the question whether we should expect it to be a passing phase or to continue. Is London just on the crest of a wave or is it swimming with a persistent stream? Putting it into perspective To start with, how important is the City? Is its press profile greater than its real contribution to the economy? The City’s output is hard to measure.2 We know that financial intermediation as a whole accounted for about 8.5% of UK Gross Value Added in 2005. And a recent estimate3 of the professional services supporting financial services accounted for a further 3.6% of economic activity in 2005, giving a total of some 12%. That compares with around 14% of GDP for the UK manufacturing sector and the jobs in financial and business services taken together have increasingly outnumbered those in manufacturing.                                                       1  “Sustaining New York’s and the US’ Global Financial Services Leadership”. Report by McKinsey & Company to Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York and Senator Charles Schumer (pages 14 and 54). 2  Indeed the ONS has announced that it will be revising its estimates of the level and composition of GDP to incorporate changes to the measurement and treatment of value added for banks and to take better account of in-house software development. 3  International Financial Services, London. “International Financial Services in the UK”, November 2006. BIS Review 29/2007 1 
And since 1999 financial services and insurance taken together have accounted for over 20% of the UK’s exports of services. So it is clear that the financial sector is an important industry for the UK. But financial intermediation covers a great deal more than the City. Retail banking and insurance, like other retail services from restaurants to hairdressing, is widely dispersed across the country. In general one would expect this part of the industry to reflect the size of the population and their wealth. To the extent that the UK’s industry may be relatively efficient and competitive, we may even have fewer people engaged at this end of the business than some other countries. While in 2003 the share of Gross Value Added from financial intermediation was a little higher for the UK than for France, Japan or Germany (5%, 7% and 4% respectively) there was not that big a gap and the figures for the US were about the same as the UK (8.5%). It is London’s position in the wholesale and international markets that is special and it is harder to get a handle on that. A recent estimate put the total number employed in “City” jobs at around 320,000.4 There are other significant European centres in Paris and Frankfurt and, within the UK, in Edinburgh for instance. But London is estimated to have 75% of UK's wholesale financial jobs and to be the largest European centre for wholesale finance with 35% of the jobs (up from 30% in 2000). So by this measure those working in “City” represent a little more than 1% of the UK workforce. While this is estimated to be twice the equivalent proportion for Germany and three times that of France, we should not get it out of perspective. The economic geography of financial centres Geographical concentrations, clusters, are common in many industries. In some cases they reflect the availability of raw materials or power sources. Elsewhere the underlying reasons are not so obvious. Watch making in Switzerland, films in Hollywood, the high-tech sector of Silicon Valley are all classic examples. But the pattern of geographical hubs is particularly prominent in the financial industry. In most countries, one city has tended to become predominant even if cities such as Chicago and Edinburgh have developed important niches in particular financial services. Over time some of these have become hubs for international finance like New York in the US, Zurich in Switzerland, Hong Kong and Singapore in Asia and, of course, London in the UK. The history of each centre has been shaped by a myriad of factors from empire, the role of guilds, and the proximity of kings and governments. But a number of economic forces have also been at work and are still reinforcing the pattern.5First, there are great advantages for both firms and workers from operating in a market with a deep pool of labour with the right skills. Workers know that if their firms fail or shrink they can easily find another job; firms can easily acquire new workers to start up or expand. Second, firms which have expertise in supplying the main industry become established close to the cluster so new front-line firms find the inputs they need on the spot. The 37,000 strong membership of the London Society of Accountants is a good example of this. Third, where specialist firms and highly skilled workers are grouped together the transfer of skills and information can be quicker. Knowledge and information pass between workers in different firms, formally and informally, as they trade with each other, so innovation is encouraged and productivity improves. Fourth, clustering tends to promote both competition and cooperation. Clusters tend therefore to increase productivity, drive innovation and stimulate the formation of new business. In these ways the clustering helps to create and reinforce the comparative advantage which drives trade. In the case of the financial industry some additional factors promote clustering. In the past of course there was the physical need to be close to the market places but it appears that the centripetal forces remain strong even in a world of electronic trading and video conferencing. There is a reputational advantage of locating in an established financial centre, which signals you are part of the Premier League. And in wholesale finance where the firms can be both sellers and buyers, business is                                                       4  “City type” jobs in London include securities dealing, international banking, corporate finance, derivatives and foreign exchange activity, fund management (including hedge funds), specialist insurance (such as Lloyds) and professional services such as legal, accountancy and consultancy directly supporting other City jobs. They include jobs in Canary Wharf and in the West End as well as those in the Square Mile. 5  See, for example, Fujita, M, Krugman, P and Venables A.J, “The Spatial Economy: Cities, Regions and International Trade” MIT 2001. 2 BIS Review 29/2007 
attracted to liquid markets, in cash and securities. Each firm benefits from a pool of competitors taking different positions. There are also some centrifugal forces that tend to limit the size of clusters and ultimately drive firms away. The more concentrated the activity, the more vulnerable trade can be to external shocks, whether from earthquakes, wars or taxes. If there are restrictions on the supply of labour, concentration can lead to shortages. And of course clustering can drive up prices of other factors of production. In a successful urban centre, land in particular can become expensive. The history of the City of London But on balance the history of London’s financial sector illustrates how powerful the factors leading towards concentration and clustering have been. During the 18th and 19th centuries, it was not hard to see why international finance developed in London alongside Britain’s pre-eminence as an economic and trading power. The need to provide finance for trade stimulated the development of the money markets here, based around commercial bills, and that in turn provided essential liquidity for longer-maturity securities markets.6By 1914, while Britain had been overtaken as the world’s leading economy, it remained the hub of the international monetary system – the Gold Standard. UK had 42% of the world stock of overseas investments and around one third of all the negotiable instruments in the world were traded on the London Stock Exchange. And if London was important to the world, the world was also crucial to London; more than half the value of securities quoted on the London Stock Exchange was accounted for by loans for foreign companies and governments.7As an editor of the Economist during the period put it: “It [the City] is the greatest shop, the greatest store, the freest market for commoditites, gold and securities, the greatest disposer of capital, the greatest dispenser of credit, but above and beyond, as well as by reason of all these marks of financial and commercial supremacy, it is the world’s clearing house.”8The benign international environment disappeared with the outbreak of the Great War, and the UK’s political and economic standing in the world fell away steadily through the following 60 years. By 1950, average incomes in the UK were below those in the United States, and they fell below Germany and France by 1970. The economic dominance of the United States ensured New York’s place as the leading financial centre and the American commercial banks became the world’s largest. In the 70s and 80s the growth of Japan propelled Tokyo up the rankings. And in Britain, the share of foreign securities issuance fell to only 6% in 1961, as against more than half before 1914. So by the 1970s London was benefiting from few of the factors which had produced its golden period before the first War. It had suffered from the destruction of the wars and the Depression, and from the loss of Empire and protectionist policies at home and abroad, including capital and exchange controls. In a faltering economy trade in government debt had supplanted much of its international business, sterling had declined as an international currency, and the major British merchant banks and brokers had been overtaken by the investment banks in the US and the universal banks in Europe and Japan. Nonetheless, through all this London remained a leading international financial and banking centre. On some measures, indeed, it retained its position as the leading centre for international finance for all but a few years after the second war.9 It had the critical mass to keep the skillbase and networks to retain the professional trade in many markets. So, even in the 1960s the Euro markets developed here.                                                       6  Michie, RC “The City of London: Continuity and Change, 1850-1990” Macmillan, Basingstoke and London, 1992. 7  Cassis, Y. “Capitals of Capital.

The recent growth of the City of London Over the last twenty years, a number of reforms have improved the environment and helped the City to build on its position. Exchange controls were removed in 1979, facilitating capital flows into and out of the UK; and Big Bang, in 1986, opened up the Stock Exchange and paved the way for the participation of the leading foreign investment banks in London’s market. At the same time the growth of international trade and thus capital flows has brought in more business. In some of the activities that London has long dominated, its growth in the last 10 years has largely reflected the growth of global capital market activity. In the foreign exchange market, for example, where the London market is and remains the largest in the world, turnover was a bit over 30% of the global total in April 2004, broadly unchanged from 1998. But turnover in London had increased by nearly 20% over the same period – a big increase despite the creation of the euro, which removed the necessity for trading between so many currency pairs. On an even larger scale the UK’s share of cross border bank leading – which has long been a strength of London’s – remained unchanged at around 20% between 1998 and 2006. But over that same period, the market grew by about 150%. But there are several areas where London’s share of business is rising, particularly in new, innovative and technically demanding areas of finance. London’s share of world over-the-counter derivatives business, for example, has risen from around 35% in 2001 to nearly 40% in April 2004. And within that the notional amount of credit derivatives traded in London multiplied by more than 100 between 1997 and 2006. While the US remains the main centre of the hedge fund sector, at the latest count twelve of the world’s largest 50 hedge funds were based in London, as against only three in 2002. London has a share of nearly 80% of the European based hedge fund market, up from around 70% in 2002. The UK private equity market has been another prominent area of growth recently. UK private equity funds raised in 2005 were over £25 billion, around twice the size of the previous peak in 2001, with the UK private equity industry accounting for over 50% of the total European market. The drivers of the City’s recent growth In part the City’s recent growth reflects – as it did a century ago – a rapid growth in international trade and financial liberalisation. Globalisation has brought an expansion of world imports by 180% since 1990 compared with an 80% increase in world GDP. Progressive upgradings of a number of emerging economies have broadened and deepened international links. Higher savings in the emerging Asian economies, in particular, have combined with demographic change in the West to increase demand for long-term savings instruments and a fall in their yields.10 All these trends taken together have led to a period since 2002 of unusually high returns for holders of many financial assets and the explosive growth in new products and markets. But what is driving the growth of London in particular? One approach to this question is to ask executives in major financial companies, both in the UK and abroad, why they choose to locate business here. A number of these surveys have been conducted recently and they show several common factors.11London benefits from English as an international language of commerce, and from its time zone, which means the working day overlaps with Asia in the morning and America in the afternoon. London also has well established financial infrastructure and telecommunication networks. Many of those surveyed point to the regulatory and legal environment. This is partly a matter of the regulatory style – the “risk based and proportionate” approach that the Financial Services Authority has adopted based on general principles where possible. It is partly the simplicity of dealing with a single regulator.                                                       10  Caballero, R. “On the macroeconomics of asset shortages” NBER WP 12753, December 2006. 11  For example, Cook, G.

English law, which is also the basis for financial services law in the United States, prevails here, with the added advantage that practitioners are less likely actually to invoke the legal system. And what has been called the Wimbledonisation of the UK financial markets – the sale of nearly all the British merchant banks and stockbrokers and the dominance of foreign players – gives confidence to prospective market participants that the competitive environment is genuinely open to all comers. London is also a growing centre for Islamic banking. Finally, London may be benefiting from measures elsewhere; certainly in the years since the Enron and WorldCom scandals, commentators have suggested that the application of the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation to foreign firms listing in New York may have encouraged some firms to list here instead. But the single most important factor is the first one suggested by economists: London’s comparative advantage lies in its skilled labour and financial know-how both in the financial firms and in the professions which support them. The free movement of labour within the European Union, and relative openness to immigration by those with specific expertise from outside it, has also meant that employers in the financial sector can access the world labour market. And the relative flexibility of the labour market here in the UK compared to others in Europe may also be a factor. That concentration of skilled labour has spurred competition and innovation. We have seen a very striking illustration of this in the last few years with the rapid growth of hedge fund management and private equity firms in London. Many have been established and are staffed by people who acquired their skills and earned their capital at the more established investment banks and fund management firms of the City. Being at the heart of world markets helped them spot the opportunities and assess the competition. Once they struck out on their own, they could draw on a network of former colleagues and contacts for staff, information and expertise. Future prospects of the City of London So what are the prospects of the City of London? One of the clear lessons from history is that any position can be lost. It is always possible to throw away an advantage by ill judged decisions. Any widespread operational disruption or fear about security could also be very damaging, which is one reason why we and the other tripartite authorities are spending so much time on improving crisis response and management. But in the absence of disaster the structural factors I have discussed seem likely to favour further concentration of financial business in the City. First, the entry of China and India international market has been associated with a massive expansion of international trade and finance in relation to overall world GDP. That seems likely to continue and has been a major factor in the growth of London in the past. Fifteen years ago people worried that developments in information technology would undermine centres like the City of London. When anyone could log on to receive market information and trade in real time, wouldn’t traders flee the hurley burley and relocate to other, quieter and cheaper financial centres or even out of cities altogether? What seems to have happened is the opposite. The reducing costs of collating information and trading at a distance have led to operations relocating to London and the City becoming an even more important cluster for financial activity. The technology which could have allowed the dispersion of business has instead allowed greater concentration.12  So whereas in 1997 the largest share of market turnover of Frankfurt’s Eurex market came from traders based in Germany (over 80%), the largest share in 2005 came from the UK (with over 45%). As more assets can be traded remotely, this may further drive the growth of centres like London with large pools of skilled financial workers. The growth of European capital markets relative to traditional commercial banking should reinforce that process. Historically, European and equity markets have been smaller relative to their economies than in the US. With around some $30 trillion in assets, euro-zone financial markets are still significantly smaller than the $50 trillion in the US. But Europe is closing the gap. In 2005 the                                                       12  HM Treasury, “The location of financial activity and the euro”, 2003. BIS Review 29/2007 5 
eurozone’s financial stock grew by over 20%, compared with around 6% in the US. And the euro-zone’s financial depth has increased at twice the pace of the US over the past 10 years.13 If this gap continues to narrow, I expect this to favour the growth of London as the main centre for Europe’s capital markets. The development of capital markets in Asia is further behind still and I would expect to see continued rapid growth in these markets in the next decade. The rationalisation brought by the single financial market in Europe should push in the same direction. The number of central counterparty (CCPs) clearing houses by ownership has halved in Europe since 1999. And there were over 650 mergers and acquisitions in the EU banking sector between 2001 and 2005, a quarter of which were cross-border within Europe. But the process has some way to go and as the European financial sector becomes more consolidated, and financial institutions become larger and more complex, they tend to become more intensive users of capital markets. The major UK banks’ trading book assets, for example, now account for over 30% of their balance sheet assets compared with little over 15% back in 2000. What of the countervailing – centrifugal pressures? The creation of Canary Wharf, the expansion of office space in the Square Mile and the West End has helped to allow the rapid expansion of recent years. But of course London is an expensive city with high land and labour costs. So we have seen financial firms outsourcing functions like IT support, systems development and HR both within the UK and Europe and to India. That too seems likely to continue so further growth of trading and management in London may well not lead to proportionate growth in jobs. On current trends we might expect a greater concentration of high value, high skill jobs in London. Conclusion So back to my question: wave or persistent stream? The answer is, as you will have spotted, both. Readers of the Bank’s Financial Stability Report (next edition due next month) – or those that have read the financial news – will know that the financial markets have been buoyant recently; in particular the premia for risks in the credit market are very low and profit growth and bonuses have been spectacular. Some of this may well be the crest of a wave. However, for the reasons I have set out this afternoon, London is also benefiting from a longer lasting and a strong current. We may expect that cycle to turn at some stage – and London will be affected because of its international position. But there are good reasons to expect London to further enhance its position as a global financial centre in the long term. And that will have implications for the rest of the economy and the risks it faces. It will continue to affect the labour market, the housing market, and the distribution of wealth and income. And it will further sharpen the dependence of the British economy on wider international movements in financial markets. I plan to return to these implications in coming months.                                                       13  McKinsey Global Institute, McKinsey & Company's economics research institute. 6 BIS Review 29/2007 
BIS Review 29/2007 1 Frederic S Mishkin: Inflation dynamics  Remarks by Mr Frederic S Mishkin, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Annual Macro Conference, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, San Francisco, California, 23 March 2007. *      *      * Under its dual mandate, the Federal Reserve seeks to promote both price stability and maximum sustainable employment.1 For this reason, we at the Federal Reserve are acutely interested in the inflation process, both to better understand the past and – given the inherent lags with which monetary policy affects the economy – to try to forecast the future. We economists have made some important strides in our understanding of inflation dynamics in recent years. To be sure, substantial gaps in our knowledge remain, and forecasting is still a famously imprecise task, but our increased understanding offers the hope that central banks will be able to continue and perhaps even improve upon their successful performance of recent years.  Today, I will outline what I see as the key stylized facts that research has in recent years uncovered about changes in the dynamics of inflation and will present my view of how to interpret these findings. The interpretation has important implications for how we should think about the conduct of monetary policy and what we think might happen to inflation over the next couple of years. I will address these two issues in the final part of the talk. Before I continue, however, I should stress that the views I will express here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The empirical evidence on changes in inflation dynamics To see what research has discovered about the evolution of inflation dynamics in recent years, let’s explore the following questions: (1) What is the available evidence on changes in inflation persistence in recent years? (2) What is the available evidence on changes in the slope of the Phillips curve? (3) What role do other variables play in the inflation process? Inflation persistence To answer the first question, we need to measure how long the effects of a shock to inflation will last. Specifically, we need to know whether inflation tends to revert quickly to its initial level, or whether the effects of the shock persist – that is, lead to a changed level of inflation for an extended period. The most obvious way of measuring inflation persistence is to regress inflation on several of its own lags and then calculate the sum of the coefficients on lagged inflation. If the sum of the coefficients is close to 1.0, then shocks to inflation have long-lived effects on inflation. In other words, inflation behaves like a random walk, so that when inflation goes up, it stays up. If the sum of the coefficients drops well below 1.0, then a shock to inflation has only a temporary effect on inflation, and inflation soon reverts back to its trend level.  The evidence from these so-called autoregressions with U.S. data suggests that inflation may have grown less persistent over time. In particular, when autoregressions are run using rolling samples with a fixed width of, say, twelve years, the sum of the lagged coefficients often falls noticeably below unity as the sample advances to include the most recent data. Figure 1 illustrates this tendency, with the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index as the measure of inflation. As you can see, the coefficient sum has declined to about 0.6 or so since the late 1990s, although the dotted lines indicate that the confidence interval for this estimate is wide and still includes 1.0. This result appears robust to the addition of other explanatory variables to the regression, although making such a modification does tend to reduce the extent of the estimated decline.2 Finally, it’s worth noting that this                                                       1  I want to thank Michael Kiley, Jean-Philippe Laforte, Deborah Lindner, David Reifschneider, John Roberts, and Jeremy Rudd for their extremely helpful comments and assistance on this speech. 2  Two recent studies that report a marked decline in inflation persistence in the United States are Nason (2006) and Williams (2006). Their findings should be treated carefully, however, as analysis by the staff of the Federal Reserve Board suggests that modest changes in methodology, such as lengthening the sample period, correcting for small-sample bias, or changing 
2 BIS Review 29/2007 is not just a U.S. phenomenon, as some studies have found similar results for a number of other countries.3  (I might proudly note in passing that the staff of the Federal Reserve System is responsible for much of this research. To avoid boring you, I will refrain from providing references to this research, but the version on this speech on the Board’s web site will include this information and will provide a more nuanced discussion of these results.) Recent work by Jim Stock and Mark Watson (2007) provides an alternative and, to me, a quite intuitive way of thinking about inflation persistence. They estimate a model that decomposes inflation into two components. The first component, which can be thought of as the underlying trend, follows a random walk, so that shocks to this component persist indefinitely and thus affect the trend inflation rate going forward. The second component is a serially uncorrelated shock, meaning that such shocks are temporary and lead to only transitory fluctuations around the trend. Stock and Watson then allow the volatility of these two kinds of shocks, trend and temporary, to vary over time. Stock and Watson find that the importance of the trend shocks relative to that of the temporary shocks started to rise at the end of the 1960s in the United States, peaked in the mid-1970s, stayed elevated over the next ten years, and then declined to a historical low (upper panel of figure 2). When the relative importance of the trend shocks became high, as it did in the 1970s and early 1980s, inflation became highly persistent. Under such conditions, if inflation went up, the trend component typically                                                                                                                                                                       the particular price index used in the analysis, can alter both the magnitude and the statistical significance of the estimated decline in persistence. 3  Levin and Piger (2004) find significant declines in inflation persistence since the 1980s for the major European economies as well as for Japan, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. However, O’Reilly and Whelan (2005) find little or no evidence for a recent decline in persistence for the euro area as a whole. 
BIS Review 29/2007 3 rose in tandem so that inflation stayed up. In contrast, when the temporary shocks were relatively more important, as was true before the 1970s and after the mid-1980s, a change in inflation tended to reflect a change in the temporary component, not the trend. As a result, fluctuations in inflation tended to fade away, implying that inflation persistence was much lower. In the context of the Stock-Watson model, then, when inflation rose to double-digit levels during the "Great Inflation" period of the 1970s and early 1980s, persistence became very high because the trend rate of inflation moved around a lot – that is, trend inflation became unanchored. Although the importance of the trend component has fallen markedly since the 1970s, the estimates produced by Stock and Watson suggest that it is still large enough to be economically meaningful. The bottom panel of figure 2 illustrates this point; as you can see, the estimated trend (the solid line) has drifted up a bit since the mid-1990s. Of course, such estimates are inevitably imprecise to some degree. For example, Cecchetti et al (2007) employ a slightly modified version of the Stock-Watson procedure in a recent paper and find that inflation persistence has fallen so low that their estimated trend for gross domestic product (GDP) price inflation has been almost perfectly flat at about 2.2 percent over the past few years. In contrast, Cogley and Sargent (2005), using a different modification of the procedure, obtain results more in line with the original Stock and Watson paper. Finally, follow-up work by staff members at the Federal Reserve Board suggests that the degree of persistence found with these techniques varies across different measures of inflation. Thus, the empirical evidence on this question can vary. Nonetheless, I think it fair to say that inflation has become less persistent over the past two decades but that the underlying trend may not yet be perfectly stable. 
4 BIS Review 29/2007 When Cecchetti and his co-authors apply this type of analysis to other countries, the results are remarkably similar. In particular, in Canada, Italy, and the United Kingdom, the importance of the trend shocks began to rise in the late 1960s and early 1970s and then declined only in the mid-1980s. France followed a similar pattern, although there the rise began a bit earlier, in 1963. In short, all these countries experienced a similar "Great Inflation," when trend inflation became unanchored. Germany and Japan had shorter periods of high persistence of inflation, with persistence beginning to decline around 1969 in Germany and around 1979 in Japan. Cecchetti and his co-authors conclude that the rise and subsequent decline of inflation persistence has thus been a worldwide phenomenon.  
BIS Review 29/2007 5 Slope of the Phillips Curve In traditional Phillips-curve equations, inflation depends on past values of inflation, an unemployment gap (the difference between the unemployment rate and an estimate of its natural rate), and variables such as the relative price of energy and import prices. When researchers estimate these equations, they typically find that the coefficient on the unemployment gap has declined (in absolute value) since the 1980s, often by a marked amount.4 In other words, the evidence suggests that the Phillips curve has flattened. The finding that inflation is less responsive to the unemployment gap, if taken at face value, suggests that fluctuations in resource utilization will have smaller implications for inflation than used to be the case. From the point of view of policymakers, this development is a two-edged sword: On the plus side, it implies that an overheating economy will tend to generate a smaller increase in inflation. On the negative side, however, a flatter Phillips curve also implies that a given increase in inflation will be more costly to wring out of the system. We can quantify this latter consideration using the so-called sacrifice ratio – the number of years that unemployment has to be 1.0 percentage point greater than its natural rate to reduce the inflation rate 1.0 percentage point. Averaging estimates obtained from a comprehensive battery of equation specifications suggests that the sacrifice ratio may be 40 percent larger – that is, it may be 40 percent more costly to reduce inflation than it was two decades ago. Is this really bad news? I will return to this question later.  Role of other variables in the inflation process Empirical evidence suggests that inflation has also become less responsive to other shocks. The two oil price shocks in the 1970s were associated with large jumps in core inflation, whereas recent surges in energy prices have not had a similar effect. This reduced sensitivity manifests itself in traditional Phillips-curve models as a substantial decline in the estimated coefficient on the energy price term in these equations. Because this term equals the change in relative energy prices multiplied by the share of energy in aggregate output, energy price effects on inflation appear to have fallen by more than can be accounted for by the greater energy efficiency of the economy.5  In contrast, unpublished empirical work by the staff at the Federal Reserve Board suggests that, once we take the rising share of imports into account, the influence of import prices on core inflation in the United States has not changed much in the context of reduced-form forecasting models.6 At the same time, the influence of exchange rate movements on import prices – the so-called pass-through effect – may have fallen substantially, at least according to some studies.7 If so, then the influence of exchange rate fluctuations on domestic inflation may now be less than it once was, when one controls for changes in the volume of our foreign trade. What interpretation can we give to changes in inflation dynamics? In interpreting these stylized facts about changes in inflation dynamics, we must first recognize that all of them are based on reduced-form relationships, and thus they are about correlations and not necessarily about true structural relationships. Because the explanatory variables in inflation                                                       4  Studies that present evidence of a marked decline in the sensitivity of U.S. inflation to unemployment and other measures of resource utilization include Roberts (2006) and Williams (2006). Unpublished work by staff at the Federal Reserve Board indicates that this result generally holds across a variety of regression specifications, estimation methods, and data definitions. Other studies find similar declines in many foreign industrial economies; see, among others, Borio and Filardo (2006) and Ihrig and others (forthcoming). However, the empirical evidence on this question is such that the exact magnitude, timing, and statistical significance of these changes remain a subject of debate. 5  Hooker (2002) finds that oil price movements during the 1980s and 1990s had little or no effect on core inflation, in contrast to a substantial influence in previous decades. Recent empirical work carried out at the Federal Reserve Board confirms Hooker’s findings using data through 2006; however, some of this work also hints that the surge in energy prices since 2004 may have had a larger influence on core inflation. 6  Interestingly, Ihrig and others (forthcoming) find that the sensitivity of inflation to movements in import prices has fallen in several foreign industrial economies. 7  For evidence on U.S. exchange rate pass-through effects, see Marazzi and others (2005). Hellerstein, Daly, and Marsh (2006) also find that pass-through has declined in the United States, although by a considerably smaller amount. Empirical results for other developed countries are reported in Sekine (2006). 
6 BIS Review 29/2007 regressions are themselves influenced by changes in economic conditions, changes in the underlying monetary policy regime are likely to be a source of changes in reduced-form inflation dynamics. This problem is especially acute for structural relationships involving expectations or other factors that are not directly observable and so cannot be included in reduced-form regressions. In such cases, we cannot use the reduced-form equations to disentangle the effects of such unobserved factors – which themselves may be driven by changes in monetary policy – from that of other influences. The most important development in monetary economics that I have witnessed over my now-long career has been the recognition that expectations are central to our understanding of the behavior of the aggregate economy. Theory tells us that inflation expectations must be a key driving force behind inflation. This dependence has long been implicit in traditional Phillips-curve analysis, but expectations – now in explicit form – are also a central feature of the increasingly popular New Keynesian Phillips curves, in which current-period inflation is a function of expectations of next period’s inflation and resource utilization. Therefore, a natural first place to look for explanations of changing inflation dynamics is a possible change in the expectations-formation process. The first stylized fact discussed earlier is that inflation persistence, which rose in the 1970s during the Great Inflation, has since declined to a much lower level. An intuitive way of thinking about this rise and fall in inflation persistence is that it resulted from an un-anchoring of trend inflation during the period of the Great Inflation, and a re-anchoring in recent years, as the work of Stock and Watson suggests. When we think about what drives trend inflation, inflation expectations – particularly long-run expectations – come to mind. A de-anchoring of inflation expectations would surely lead to trend inflation becoming unanchored, whereas an anchoring of inflation expectations at a particular level would necessarily lead to a stabilization of trend inflation and hence a decline in inflation persistence. Do indicators of inflation expectations support this story? They certainly do. Consider the measure of expected inflation for the coming twelve months reported by the Livingston survey. As illustrated by the dashed line in figure 3 , this measure of expected short-run inflation – adjusted by a constant factor to convert it from a CPI basis to a PCE basis – soared during the 1970s and then fell back markedly during the 1980s and early 1990s. Over the past few years, the short-run series has fluctuated around 2 percent, with its month-to-month movements correlated with swings in energy prices, as one might expect. An even more striking story is told by the survey-based measure of expected long-run inflation used in the FRB/US model, the dotted blue line in figure 3.8 When we look at this long-run series (which should be more closely related to expectations about policy objectives than the short-run measure), we see that the public’s expectations stood at a high level of 7-3/4 percent at the start of the 1980s, when this information first began to be collected. From that point on, however, expectations fell steadily over the 1980s and most of the 1990s as the process of re-anchoring continued. By 1998, this process was apparently completed, and since that time the public’s expectations – at least according to this particular measure – have been steady as a rock. Estimates of inflation compensation derived from indexed Treasury yields have also been remarkably stable in recent years. Figure 3 also reproduces the estimate of trend inflation produced by the Stock-Watson procedure (the solid line). As you can see, this series more or less tracks the survey-based measures of long-run expectations, suggesting that the anchoring of long-run inflation expectations in recent years may explain the finding of a marked decline in inflation persistence. Anchoring of inflation expectations is not a deus ex machina. It must come from somewhere, and since Milton Friedman’s adage that “[i]nflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon” is still true, monetary policy must be the source of the change in the evolution of long-run inflation expectations. During the 1960s and 1970s, the Federal Reserve and a number of other central banks maintained a policy stance that, inadvertently or not, was too easy on average and that allowed both actual and expected inflation to drift up markedly over many years. Since the late 1970s, however, the Federal Reserve and many other central banks have increased their commitment to price stability, in both words and actions. The Fed pursued preemptive strikes against rises in inflation in 1994-95, 1999-00, and in 2004-06, as well as preemptive strikes against potentially deflationary forces in the fall                                                       8  The FRB/US series splices data from two surveys of expected long-run inflation – the Hoey survey of financial market participants from 1981 through 1989, and the Survey of Professional Forecasters from 1990 on. After splicing, a 50-basis-point constant factor is subtracted from the series to put it on a PCE price index basis, on the assumption that survey respondents reported their expectation for CPI inflation, not PCE inflation. (The average wedge between CPI inflation and PCE inflation was about 50 basis points from 1980 through 2006.) I have made a similar adjustment to the Livingston survey data plotted in figure 3 to put it on a PCE price basis. 
BIS Review 29/2007 7 of 1998 and in 2001-04. The result has been not only low and stable inflation but also, as we have seen, a strong anchoring of long-run inflation expectations. The pursuit of more-aggressive monetary policy to control inflation and the achievement of anchored inflation expectations can also help explain the other stylized facts about inflation dynamics. With expectations of inflation anchored, any given shock to inflation – whether it is from aggregate demand, energy prices, or the foreign exchange rate – will have a smaller effect on expected inflation and hence on trend inflation. These shocks will then have a much less persistent effect on actual inflation. The recent experience with surging oil prices seems consistent with this story. The price of West Texas intermediate crude oil rose from about $30 per barrel in late 2003 to a peak of almost $75 per barrel in July of last year. During this episode, inflation appears to have been boosted only temporarily and by a strikingly small amount, in contrast to the 1970s when oil price shocks led to large, persistent increases in inflation.  Interestingly, monetary policy could have worked to flatten the estimated Phillips curve even without these favorable expectational effects, simply by moving more aggressively to stabilize both inflation and output. A theorem from the literature on optimal control states that implementing a policy of adjusting some instrument to stabilize a particular variable has the effect, in the limit, of driving the correlation between the instrument and the targeted variable to zero. Thus, a monetary policy that more successfully stabilizes inflation and resource utilization could well lead to a smaller estimated coefficient on unemployment gaps in a traditional Phillips-curve equation. Research carried out with quite different models of the macroeconomy by my former colleagues at Columbia, Jean Boivin and Marc Giannoni (2006), and by John Roberts (2006) at the Federal Reserve Board, supports these conclusions. In particular, their analyses suggest that changes in the way the Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy – including changes in both the parameters of monetary policy reaction functions and the volatility of shocks to those functions – may account for most of the reduction in the coefficients on resource utilization in traditional Phillips curves.9                                                        9  Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (2000) make a similar argument, but for a dissenting view, see Rudebusch (2005). 
8 BIS Review 29/2007 What is particularly attractive about highlighting a better anchoring of inflation expectations as probably the primary factor driving the changes in inflation dynamics is that this one explanation covers so many of the stylized facts – an application of Occam’s razor. Indeed, I have always become more confident in a theory if it can explain a number of very different facts.10 This is why I am so attracted to the view that inflation expectations are a key driving factor in the inflation process. Of course, many other factors also influence inflation, and some of these provide other possible explanations for the recent changes in inflation dynamics. For example, smaller coefficients on unemployment gaps and energy prices in traditional Phillips curve equations may reflect the influence of lower and less-variable inflation on the frequency with which firms change their prices. In the context of a low-inflation environment, firms may have concluded that they can leave their prices fixed for longer periods at little cost, causing inflation to be less responsive to shocks, particularly if they are transitory. In this way, monetary policy may have affected the slope of the Phillips curve without having affected the manner in which expectations are formed. Also, from the mid-1980s through the first years of this decade, energy price movements were smaller and more transitory. We see this in futures markets, in which oil prices in far-dated futures contracts moved much less than spot prices over this period, suggesting that people expected a quick reversal in any rise in oil prices. Such transitory shocks to energy price would presumably have a smaller effect on inflation than the more-persistent oil price shocks of the 1970s and early 1980s. Increased globalization and other sources of increased competition may also have lowered the sensitivity of domestic inflation to aggregate demand, thereby flattening the Phillips curve. However, the evidence on this last point is limited and inconclusive.11  Policy implications These stylized facts – that inflation has become less persistent and now responds less to aggregate demand and supply shocks – can lead to inappropriate policy advice. If we take these facts to be structural and attributable to factors other than monetary policy, we might interpret them as suggesting that the Federal Reserve could respond less to shocks and yet be confident that inflation would remain at a low level. In addition, the smaller coefficient on unemployment gaps in traditional Phillips-curve models, which seems to imply that the sacrifice ratio has gone up, might lead us to think that reducing inflation is very costly because it requires long periods of high unemployment. As a result, policymakers might decide that such an attempt would not be worthwhile and so would be less likely to try to reduce inflation if it were undesirably high. If used in model simulation exercises, the flatter Phillips curve might also suggest that getting inflation down to a particular desired level could take an inordinately long time.  However, if we instead attribute the observed changes in inflation dynamics to better monetary policy and a resultant better anchoring of inflation expectations, then such policy conclusions are unwarranted. Under this alternative interpretation, the reason that inflation has become less persistent is that monetary policy, in carrying out its dual mandate of promoting both price stability and maximum sustainable employment, has been vigilant in maintaining a low rate of inflation on average. But if the monetary authorities were to become complacent and to think that they could get away with not reacting to shocks that, in their mistaken view, no longer have the potential to cause inflation to rise persistently, then inflation expectations would surely become unhinged again. In short, complacency that might arise from the current low inflation persistence might result in deja vu all over again and return us to an era like the Great Inflation. These are exactly the concerns expressed in Tom Sargent’s (2000) book on the rise and fall of U.S. inflation, in which he worries that a misunderstanding of the inflation process might again lead to a high-inflation equilibrium.                                                       10  This is why Milton Friedman’s Theory of the Consumption Function is one of my favorite pieces of empirical research. What is extraordinary about this book is that it has only a handful of regressions but nonetheless shows that the basic idea of permanent income has to be right because the theory explains numerous facts derived from numerous studies. This book is not widely read by graduate students nowadays, but it should be. 11  See Borio and Filardo (2006) and Ihrig and others (forthcoming) for opposing views on this issue. Borio and Filardo provide evidence that global output gaps may be just as important as conventional domestic output gaps in the determination of inflation; moreover, they argue that these effects have been rising over time. However, Ihrig and her co-authors find that Borio and Filardo’s results are sensitive to small changes in specification; they also find little support for an independent role of global output gaps and no evidence that globalization can account for falling coefficients on domestic gaps. 
BIS Review 29/2007 9 If inflation has indeed become less persistent because better monetary policy has anchored inflation expectations more solidly, the monetary authorities may find that they have less need to induce large swings in economic activity to control inflation. This is a key benefit of establishing a strong nominal anchor. Because the public has become confident that the Fed will do the right thing, expectations now behave in a manner that makes the economy more stable to begin with. If this hypothesis is correct, cyclical movements in interest rates need not be as great as was necessary when expectations were unanchored. However, these favorable circumstances will persist only so long as the monetary authorities continue to ratify the public’s expectations. Consistent with its dual mandate, the Fed must therefore continue to respond aggressively to shocks that have potentially persistent adverse effects on both inflation and real activity. Because long-run inflation expectations are a key driver of trend inflation, the monetary authorities need to monitor long-run inflation expectations closely. If they find that they are losing credibility with the markets, so that inflation expectations begin to drift and rise above (or fall below) a desired level, they must take actions to restore their credibility. At the Federal Reserve, we understand the importance to the health of the economy of anchoring inflation expectations. This is why Federal Reserve officials continually reiterate our commitment to maximum sustainable employment and price stability, why we have been willing to make preemptive strikes against both inflationary and deflationary pressures, and why we remain vigilant about developments in the economy that could lead to persistent departures of inflation from levels that are consistent with price stability. My view – that recent changes in inflation dynamics result primarily from better-anchored inflation expectations and not from structural change or simply the achievement of a persistent low rate of inflation – implies some very good news: Potentially inflationary shocks, like a sharp rise in energy prices, are less likely to spill over into expected and actual core inflation. Therefore, the Fed does not have to respond as aggressively as would be necessary if inflation expectations were unanchored, as they were during the Great Inflation era. Indeed, this can help explain why the recent sharp rises in energy prices have had a much more benign effect on the real economy than they did in the 1970s – a point that then-Governor Ben Bernanke made three years ago. Although solidly anchored inflation expectations are indeed highly desirable, they could pose a bit of a problem for monetary policy if they were at a level somewhat above or below the rate preferred by policymakers. Under such circumstances, the central bank would likely be interested in shifting the public’s expectations in a more favorable direction. Whether such adjustment would be easy or difficult is, unfortunately, quite uncertain because we do not understand the expectations-formation process very well. In some early models that used the rational expectations assumption, changing inflation expectations was relatively easy and thus implied sacrifice ratios that were extremely low, suggesting that the monetary authorities could shift inflation at little cost. However, the historical record suggests that permanently lowering inflation expectations may require keeping monetary policy tight for a substantial period, resulting in considerable output and employment losses for a time. On the other hand, as Christy and David Romer (2002) have pointed out, the Federal Reserve in the 1970s overestimated the cost of reducing inflation because estimates of sacrifice ratios by Arthur Okun and other economists at that time proved to be too high.12 As a historical note, this provides one explanation for the Federal Reserve’s tolerance of such high inflation at the time. The disinflation after October 1979, carried out by the Federal Reserve under the leadership of Paul Volcker using words, procedures, and actions that were a sharp break from the past, produced a much lower cost of disinflation than policymakers had anticipated during the 1970s. I think these considerations leave us with fairly wide bounds on what the costs might be of permanently shifting long-run inflation expectations that are already anchored. On the one hand, the historical record gives us little reason to think the costs would be as minimal as the simplest models with rational expectations might suggest. On the other hand, overly pessimistic estimates have proved to be wrong in the past.                                                        12  Okun (1978) estimated that a 10 percent reduction in real GDP for one year would reduce the inflation rate only 1.0 percentage point. By the mid-1980s, however, Federal Reserve Board staff estimates of the sacrifice ratio were roughly half as large. 
10 BIS Review 29/2007 Implications for inflation forecasts I have argued here that the most attractive explanation for recent changes in inflation dynamics is that expectations have become better anchored. Inflation is now less persistent and more likely to gravitate to a trend level that is determined by where long-run inflation expectations have settled. What implication does this have for forecasts of future inflation? In this framework, the first priority is to determine where inflation expectations may be anchored. This task is somewhat tricky. According to the latest reading from the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF), long-term inflation expectations are currently around 2 percent, as measured by the PCE price index that the FOMC has emphasized. The private forecasters appear to have held this view for many years, given that long-run expectations for CPI inflation in the SPF have been running at around 2-1/2 percent since the late 1990s, and that the average historical wedge between the CPI measure and the PCE measure of inflation has been about 50 basis points.13  Of course, the views of professional forecasters may not be representative of what the average person or firm is thinking. If we turn to the financial markets, we find that inflation expectations extracted from a comparison of the yields between Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS) and standard Treasury securities seem consistent with an anchor at or perhaps a little above 2 percent in terms of PCE inflation.14 I say “seem consistent,” because we cannot be sure about at least one of the items used in the extraction, the premium paid to investors to compensate them for inflation risk. In the case of households, long-term inflation expectations from the Reuters/Michigan survey have been running much higher for a number of years, at around 3 percent. However, this figure seems overstated in light of the persistent bias found in the short-term inflation expectations reported by this survey. Correcting for the bias, these survey results are probably more in line with PCE inflation closer to 2 percent.15 As for firms, we unfortunately have no good data on their inflation expectations. More information on this score would be particularly welcome, but expectations in general is an area worthy of further study. Taken together, the data suggest to me that long-run inflation expectations are currently around 2 percent. That said, I think it should be clear that the evidence points to a range of estimates; moreover, this range is itself uncertain because of the assumptions needed to tease point estimates from the available data. So, although I think that 2 percent is a reasonable estimate of current long-run expectations, I don’t want to overstate the precision of this figure. We still face some uncertainty in this regard, and policymakers must be cautious about placing too much confidence in any one estimate. If long-run expectations are in fact about 2 percent, where is actual inflation likely to be headed in the next year or two? While recognizing how embarrassingly wrong such prognostications often turn out to be, I think that we can be reasonably optimistic that core PCE inflation will gradually drift down from its latest twelve-month reading of 2-1/4 percent. This process may take a while in light of the recent rebound in prices for gasoline and other petroleum products. These price increases have boosted the cost of producing many non-energy goods and services, and as firms gradually pass on these higher                                                       13  Recently, the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) has begun to report long-run expectations for the PCE price index as well as the CPI. Long-run expectations for PCE price inflation were 2 percent in the latest release, the same rate as indicated by the FRB/US estimate since the late 1990s. (The FRB/US estimate since 1991 derives from the SPF reading on expected long-run CPI inflation less an average historical wedge between the CPI measure and the PCE measure of inflation of about 50 basis points.) Interestingly, long-run expectations for CPI inflation in the SPF ticked down to 2-1/3 percent in the latest survey, suggesting that private forecasters may have lowered their estimate of the average CPI-PCE wedge to about 30 basis points. Such a revision would be in line with current Board staff estimates, which indicate that the wedge has declined in recent years and now stands at about 30 basis points. 14  Inflation compensation – the difference between nominal and indexed Treasury yields – has recently been about 1/2 percent. However, two adjustments are necessary to translate inflation compensation into an estimate of expected long-term inflation on a PCE price basis. First, because the difference between nominal and indexed yields equals the sum of inflation expectations and an inflation term premium, we must subtract an estimate of the premium. Given that term premiums on nominal Treasury yields are extremely low at present, the inflation term premium is probably less than 25 basis points currently, and could even be zero. Second, because the inflation series used to index the Treasury securities is the CPI, not the PCE price index, we must subtract an estimate of the wedge between the two measures of inflation. If we use the same 30 basis points wedge expected by private forecasters in the latest reading from the SPF, indexed and nominal yields appear to be consistent with expected long-term PCE inflation of about 2 percent or a little higher. 15  According to the Reuters/Michigan survey, long-term inflation expectations of households are currently around 3 percent, as they have been for the past few years. This survey does not specify a price index. However, expectations from the companion one-year-ahead expectations have come in about 75 basis points higher than actual PCE inflation since 1990, suggesting that there may be a systematic bias in the responses to the Reuters/Michigan survey relative to this measure of inflation. If this bias also applies to longer-run inflation expectations, then household expectations may be in line with PCE inflation running in the vicinity of 2-1/4 percent in the long run. 
BIS Review 29/2007 11 costs to their customers, monthly readings on the change in core prices are likely to be higher than they otherwise would be. Once this process is completed, however, we might expect consumer price inflation to move into better alignment with long-run expectations and thus settle in around 2 percent. Of course, our understanding of the empirical links between our measures of expected inflation and actual inflation is sufficiently poor that things could well go awry with this forecast. Moreover, many things could happen in the coming months to alter the outlook, as the recent fluctuations in energy markets and swings in GDP growth illustrate.  Looking to the medium term, I am less optimistic about the prospects for core PCE inflation to move much below 2 percent in the absence of a determined effort by monetary policy. For the most part, this assessment – which I should stress is subject to considerable uncertainty – flows from my view that long-term expectations appear to be well anchored at a level not very far below the current rate of inflation. If so, a substantial further decline in inflation would require a shift in expectations, and such a shift could be difficult and time consuming to bring about, as I noted earlier. As I mentioned at the start, central bankers are acutely interested in the inflation process. This is why I have thought about the topic a lot and chosen to talk about it today. I hope you have found my musings on this subject useful. References Bernanke, Ben (2004).

Durmuş Yilmaz: Economic outlook for Turkey Speech by Mr Durmuş Yilmaz, Governor of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey, at the Bursa Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Bursa, 11 January 2007. *      *      * Distinguished industrialists, businessmen, dear guests and members of the press, This is the first of the series of meetings planned for 2007, which has become a traditional platform aiming at bringing the representatives of the real sector together directly. Firstly, I wish to thank Dünya Newspaper and Bursa Chamber of Commerce and Industry for organizing this meeting and thereby giving me the opportunity to exchange information and views about the economic outlook with the distinguished industrialists and businessmen like you. In the first part of my speech, I would like to present a general evaluation of the year 2006 with a special emphasis on inflation, and to explain our policy implementations and to share our forecasts regarding 2007 in the light of the current data available. Then, I would like, once more, to mention about growth, employment and current account deficit that we have shared with the public many times, constituting the major items on the economic agenda. I will then elaborate on what should be done in this regard in the medium and long term.  Distinguished Guests, The primary objective of the Bank is to achieve and maintain price stability, as laid down in the Central Bank law. The Central Bank pursues and will continue to pursue its monetary policy objectives with determination within the context of its historical mission and responsibility, as stated in the legal framework and the guidelines that were determined in 2001. In this framework, inflation targets are determined jointly with the government; while the choice of the monetary policy tools and their implementation principles are determined by the Central Bank. In other words, the Central Bank was provided with the instrumental independence by its law. The instrumental independence enables the Central Bank to design and implement its monetary policies with a medium term perspective. Distinguished Guests, Following the establishment of the institutional and legal framework of the monetary policy in accordance with the modern central banking principles, significant steps were taken in the fight against inflation. Thus, a rapid disinflation process was experienced and all of the inflation targets were attained for four consecutive years due to the macroeconomic policies, especially the fiscal policy that were implemented consistently with the inflation targets. The inflation rate of 7.7 percent realized at the end of 2005 was the lowest figure, which was recorded in the last thirty-five years. However, price stability could not have been achieved yet despite all these favorable developments and achievements. Our fight against inflation still continues. It should not be forgotten that this is a long and challenging process as confirmed by the inflation figures of 2006. When we consider the deterioration that inflation brought about both in economic and social life, we see that this fight is indispensable and significant; that it is one of the determinant factors in shaping the future of an economy, a society, a country on solid foundations. Distinguished Guests, Now, let me briefly mention the developments in inflation in 2006, the basic reasons leading to divergence from the target and the applications of the monetary policy within this process. 2006 has been a year during which supply shocks, seasonal conditions and external factors were determinant on inflation. As of the beginning of 2006, an upward trend in inflation was observed especially in the first seven months and the annual inflation went up to 11.7 percent in July. The leading factor driving the inflation upwards in this period was the soaring unprocessed food product prices as of the end of 2005 due to the unfavorable weather conditions. Annual rate of increase in the prices of this group became 21.8 percent in July. BIS Review 28/2007 1 
Fluctuations in the markets and depreciation of the Turkish Lira due to the negativities in the global liquidity conditions and the increase in uncertainty perceptions regarding our country during the May-June period led to an increase in the prices of commodities priced in foreign currency besides imported goods and affected inflation figures unfavorably. Another important factor that was influential in the first half of 2006 was an accelerated increase in the prices of crude oil and other commodity prices in the international markets. This increase, accompanied by the depreciation of the Turkish Lira led to a rise in domestic energy prices and so played a key role in increasing the inflation figures. A slow-down in price increases has been observed as of August due to the decrease in the prices of gold and oil in the international markets, stabilization in the financial markets with the re-appreciation of the Turkish Lira and the effect of the decisiveness in the fight against inflation over expectations. Nevertheless, inflation remained high due to the sustained upward trend in the unprocessed food products, Ramadan-based effects and the belated reflections of the depreciation experienced in the Turkish Lira following that date. Looking at the end-year inflation in the main expenditures groups, we see that the annual inflation remains below the target in clothing, footwear and communications groups, whereas it goes beyond the target in all other groups. In this respect, rigidity of inflation in the services group constituted an important handicap against the fight against inflation in 2006 as it did in the previous years. End-year inflation became 12.2 percent in this group. Rents in the services group showed a great increase and an annual inflation rate of 20 percent remained above the general consumer inflation. Inflation figure of 12.9 percent in transportation services is another important factor that determines the inflation rate in the services group. Distinguished Guests, Consumer prices increased by 0.23 percent on monthly basis and remained below the expectations in the last month of 2006 and the year 2006 ended with an annual inflation of single digit as 9.65 percent. This figure is well above our end-year target of 5 percent. Although divergence from the inflation targets is experienced in the countries implementing this regime, it is very upsetting for us to observe such a great divergence from this target in the first year that we embarked on full-fledged inflation targeting regime. As a requisite of the principle of accountability, the detailed “Open Letter” elaborating the reasons of this divergence together with the policy measures to be taken will be sent to the government as soon as possible and be made public. Dear Guests, Due to the rapid increase in inflation in the first seven months of 2006, its being quite higher than expectations especially in April and May, fluctuations experienced in the financial markets and the uncertainty perceptions created by political developments, inflation expectations diverged from the inflation target. Inflation expectations of 12-months increased to 8.1 percent in July from 5.5 percent in April; while that of 24 months increased to 6.1 percent in July from 4.7 percent in April. Upon the emergence of the possibility of a permanent deterioration in expectations causing inflation to diverge from the targets in the medium term, the Monetary Policy Committee made effective use of the short-term interest rates as the basic policy instrument. Within this context, the Committee implemented a strong tightening policy and increased the policy rates by 425 bps to 17.5 percent in the June-July period in order to put an end to the deterioration in medium and long-term inflation expectations and also to render the inflation targets attainable in the medium term. Following this strong monetary tightening of the Monetary Policy Committee and the measures taken for financial stability, fluctuations in financial markets gradually decreased and medium and long-term inflation expectations partially improved. In this regard, inflation expectations of 12 and 24 months decreased to 7.1 percent and 5.6 percent respectively, as of the end-2006. The Monetary Policy Committee kept the policy rates unchanged in the period between August- December in 2006 due to this improvement observed in inflation expectations, mild progress in international liquidity conditions and a gradually favorable outlook of the future course of inflation compared to the first half of the year. 2 BIS Review 28/2007 
Dear Guests, I would like to draw your attention to two rather important factors about our decisions regarding short-term policy rates. Firstly, the decisions that the Central Bank took regarding the short-term policy rates affect the economic activities with a certain lag, as is the case with the other economies. That is why the Bank considers the course of inflation in the medium term rather than the current course while taking decisions about policy rates. The Bank also pays attention to the consistency of the course of inflation in the medium term with the targets. However, settlement of such a medium-term approach in the countries having experienced chronic inflation for a long time like ours takes time and this is an important handicap for the fight against inflation. Therefore, recognition and adoption of the medium-term approach by all units within the economy bears great importance so that policy decisions can be interpreted accurately and implemented effectively. Thus, we put special emphasis on this subject in all reports and announcements made by the Bank. Secondly, the Bank makes use of a wide set of data in order to foresee the medium-term course of inflation. The Bank publishes an “Inflation Report” quarterly. This report announces to the public the numerical inflation forecasts with a medium-term approach together with the consistent policy response. However, all the new information we obtain and all the new developments can change our projections and numerical inflation forecasts regarding the course of inflation. The forecasts published by the Bank should be evaluated within this framework and it should be noted that they can change when the conditions regarding economic environment change. Distinguished Guests, Now I would like to briefly talk about the significant factors, which may affect the outlook of inflation. First of all, the support of the private consumption demand for inflation in a downward direction, caused by the tight monetary policy stance, is expected to continue in forthcoming period. Although the developments in the crude oil prices which have strong repercussions on the course of inflation has indicated a positive outlook recently, oil and energy prices still constitute a major risk factor that can affect inflation targets. Unprocessed food prices, which have a remarkable weight within the inflation basket, is another factor of uncertainty for the future course of inflation due to the fluctuations in its course by showing sharp moves owing to the seasonal conditions. Elimination of price rigidities in the services sector also bears great importance in the fight against inflation. Practices to increase supply and competition in this sector are needed. On the other hand, we see that the unfavorable effects of the fluctuation period on inflation are eliminated thanks to the completion of the primary effects of the depreciation of the Turkish Lira on inflation as of the end of 2006. Nevertheless, rapid changes in the global risk perceptions, international liquidity conditions and the resulting fluctuations that can be experienced in domestic financial markets are other risk factors that may cause the inflation go beyond the figures that we temporarily foresee. Considering from the viewpoint of fiscal policies, we should note that one of the factors ensuring the maintenance of the downward trend of inflation in the medium-term is the sustainability of fiscal discipline and the revenues policy consistent with the targets without hesitations. Within this context, we closely monitor the effects of the adjustments in the revenues policy and the primary public expenditures on inflation and inflation expectations. The achievements in structural reforms support the increase in efficiency via the improvements in competition and investment environments, contributing to the downward trend of inflation. The structural reform process has a determining effect also on the expectations. Unceasing maintenance of the steps in this area are important for the permanency of the downward trend in inflation. Even if a considerable improvement is observed today in comparison with the first half of the year, medium-term inflation expectations that are higher than targets are the other risk factors regarding the inflation outlook. This is due to the possibility of these expectations to bring about deteriorations in the pricing behaviors. Dear Guests, Although some political developments regarding the negotiations with the European Union may come to the forefront, and some interruptions and delays may occur, this process itself does mean BIS Review 28/2007 3 
convergence to the developed economies in economic terms. Together with the IMF, it also functions as an important anchor for the domestic and foreign economic units. This perspective, which is very influential on expectations, should be preserved.  When all these developments are evaluated altogether, we see that the Monetary Policy Committee preserves its cautious stance. The Bank implements its policies with aim of achieving the inflation target that is determined as 4 percent for the years 2007, 2008 and 2009. Currently, we foresee that the inflation targets can be achieved as long as the cautious stance of the monetary policy and fiscal discipline are maintained and the incomes policy is implemented in accordance with the inflation targets and the expectations are managed effectively. Distinguished Guests, The floating exchange rate regime is the basic element of the inflation targeting regime that we currently implement. The exchange rate regime is determined with the government. The Central Bank is responsible for the design and implementation of the exchange rate policy under this regime. Level of the rates under the floating rate regime is determined by the foreign exchange supply and demand under the market conditions. The short-term value of the Turkish Lira is determined by the developments in the foreign exchange supply and demand, behaviors of the market players and short-term expectations; whereas that of the long term is determined by the economic fundamentals, course of the structural reforms and medium and long-term expectations. The basic policy instrument of the Central Bank in the inflation targeting regime is the short-term interest rates. Both the economic literature and the experiences of the countries show that, it is impossible for central banks to keep both the interest rates and foreign exchange rates under control at the same time in the economies where international capital movements are free as in ours. Therefore, the Central Bank does not and will not have an implicit commitment regarding the level of the foreign exchange rate, or a policy towards rendering the Turkish Lira valuable. When we look at the period starting from 2001 in which the floating exchange rate regime was embarked on up to now, we see a number of fluctuations in the foreign exchange rates, the most recent of which was observed in the May-June period. Similar fluctuations may be experienced in the future. The course of conduct of the Central Bank regarding the foreign exchange markets is quite clear. The risk of foreign currency is borne by the market players. The fluctuations that are experienced clearly display that these types of risks may arise any time and that they should be managed effectively. Economic units should ensure the required protection against the risks regarding their balance sheets in the modern sense within the scope of the risk management principles. Remarkable attainments were obtained in the banking sector within this context. The private sector also should need to adopt a similar approach in this respect. The reason why I attach such a special importance to this subject and put emphasis on this with similar expressions in almost all my speeches is to draw attention to the possible risks that the economic units may confront under the floating rate regime and increase awareness. Otherwise, the deterioration brought about by the mis-management of risk affects the economy as a whole. Dear Guests, When the course of the value of Turkish currency versus foreign currency from 2002 up to now is taken into account, it is observed that as long as tight monetary and fiscal policies are maintained; structural reforms are implemented, political stability is maintained and the decisiveness for macroeconomic stability is sustained; the basic tendency will be in favor of the appreciation of the Turkish currency. This is a process in which the Turkish currency is increasingly preferred for investment as in every robust economy although it is subject to occasional interruptions. Therefore, the value of the Turkish currency emerges as a clear consequence. Determination of the foreign exchange rates under the market conditions as a requisite of the floating exchange rate regime does not imply that the Bank shall not undertake any transactions in the foreign exchange markets. As it was also explained in detail in our announcement called “Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy for 2007”, the Central Bank undertakes transactions in the foreign exchange markets for two objectives. The first one of these transactions is the daily foreign exchange purchasing auctions that are implemented transparently and under methods in accordance with certain rules to serve the Bank’s purpose of reserve accumulation. The Central Bank purchases foreign exchange from the market via 4 BIS Review 28/2007 
these auctions when the supply of foreign exchange is abundant under a moderate reserve-increasing strategy. The second situation in which the Bank undertakes transactions is the direct interventions in order to prevent existing or possible excessive volatilities in the foreign exchange rates. These interventions are neither mechanic nor symmetric. The Bank evaluates all the changes occurring in the foreign exchange rates with regard to its own conditions and takes the decision for intervention accordingly. As a result of the foreign exchange purchasing auctions and the direct interventions implemented within the scope of the foreign exchange policy, net purchase of 44.8 billion USD from the market has been made in a period of five years as of 9 January 2007. Following the foreign exchange purchases embarked on as of April 2002, reserves of the Bank increased by 199 percent and reached 60.8 billion USD on 29 December 2006. Dear Guests, Now I would like to mention the growth performance of the Turkish economy and the things to be done in this respect. The Turkish economy has been growing consecutively for the last 19 quarters. Gross National Product grew by 8.8 percent in real terms in the second quarter of 2006; and the growth rate decreased to 3 percent in the third quarter due to the monetary tightening and the fluctuations in the financial markets in June and July. Therefore, accumulated real growth has been 41 percent and the average growth rate has been 7.6 percent as of 2001. Looking at the possible short-term outlook of growth before moving on to the evaluation of the process of structural change in the dynamics of the growth in the Turkish economy, I wish to emphasize that the slowdown observed in the economic activities in the third quarter of 2006 does not necessarily mean that a stagnation will be experienced in the last quarter of 2006 or after that. Considering these, we foresee that the growth rate in the last quarter of 2006 may remain at a low level due to the basis effect created by high growth rate in 2005. However, the annual growth rate of 2006 may realize around 5 percent in accordance with the program. In the light of the current information, we foresee that the annual growth rates will start increasing again as of the second half of 2007. The Turkish economy has recorded remarkable improvements towards overcoming the period of fluctuating growth rates thanks to the macroeconomic stability environment established in the last five years. The determining factors in growth rates have been the private sector consumption and investments. Private sector’s consumption expenditures rose by 36.4 percent in real terms in the period from 2001 to third quarter of 2006, while public expenditures rose by 15.5 percent with the acceleration especially in the last two quarters. Looking at the investment side, we see that the private sector’s investment spending increased by 134.3 percent in real terms while the public investment spending went up by 14.1 percent. The high increases observed in investment spending also indicate that the investment-oriented basis of growth is widening and so the production capacity is increasing. Another resource for growth is the high increase in efficiency. Accumulated efficiency increased by 39.3 percent in the last five years. The high efficiency rates support the growth process without inflation on the one hand and they contribute to the sustainability of growth on the other. The exports have had great contributions in growth in recent years and this contribution keeps growing gradually. The Turkish economy is opening its doors. Accumulated annual exports rose by 167.5 percent as of November 2006 compared to the year 2001. The total trade volume in the last year reached 220.8 billion USD and it constitutes 57 percent of the national income. BIS Review 28/2007 5 
Dear Guests, The new structure of the growing process in our country is an indicator of the significance of macroeconomic stability, which lies on the basis of price stability for growth and competition. According to the Global Competition Index, Turkey became one of the countries that increased its competitive power at the most in 2006 and drawing ahead by 12 rows, ranked 59 within 125 countries1. Maintenance of this growth and establishment of a sustainable growth process are indispensable requirements for an increase in social wealth, which is the final objective of all economic policies. Therefore, today everyone should focus on the things to be done for the sustainability of the growth process in our economy rather than the daily market transactions. When successful country samples regarding growth and development processes are considered, we see that there are certain phases in the growth process. These phases are growth based on factor accumulation; increase in efficiency; research and development activities and innovations respectively. Turkey is currently going through a process of growth based on increase in efficiency. However, ensuring the permanency of growth in the medium and long-term necessitates focusing on the research and development activities besides increases in efficiency and going through a process of growth based on innovations. Dear Guests, It is obligatory for the private sector to establish medium and long-term strategies rather than short-term ones, in order to last long within the domestic and foreign competition environment that is gradually becoming more challenging owing to both the changing domestic dynamics and the increasing openness. Elimination of the unfavorable conditions in bureaucracy, politics and taxing regulations that are the primary items of the list of the factors affecting competition negatively in Turkey bear great importance in this respect.2The key factor for this is ensuring development in the principles3 of governance both for the public and the private sector. A great improvement is recorded in terms of the principles of governance as of the year 2000 and improvements in almost all of the indicators are observed. It is not a coincidence that the improvement in the principles of good governance and the one in macroeconomic performance to intersect. However, it is clear that there is too much to achieve compared to the European countries. Good governance has a key role in ensuring the macroeconomic stability and rendering this process permanent. Therefore, it is one of the pre-requisites of a sustainable growth process. Structural reforms bear great importance in this regard. The research carried out with respect to the OECD countries4 reveals that the economic growth rates of the countries engaging in rapid and comprehensive structural reforms increase in vast amounts. Additionally, structural reforms are complementary. Halt of the progress of structural reforms in one field prevents the attainment of favorable outcomes of the reforms made in other fields. Reforms to remove the defects in the social security system; to prevent unregistered economic activities; to provide the labor market with a more flexible structure via education; to restructure the taxing system; to continue with the reforms in the financial sector incessantly and to increase efficiency in the agricultural sector should be given priority in our country. On the other hand, considering that growth is a dynamic process, it is very important to strengthen the macro reforms with micro measures and being in a search for a strategic approach in accordance with the changing needs and newly emerging structures. The public and private sector should engage in cooperation in this field.                                                       1  Global Competitiveness Report 2006-2007, World Economic Forum. 2  Global Competitiveness Report 2006-2007, World Economic Forum. 3  Indicators of good governance are prevention of corruption, the rule of law, efficiency of the legislation and regulations, quality of the state services, political stability and transparency and accountability. 4 Macedo, J.B. ve Martins, J.O. (2006). “Growth, Reform Indicators and Policy Complementaries”. 6 BIS Review 28/2007 
The public sector should assume a supervisory and regulatory role within the scope of the principles of good governance and work towards creating an atmosphere in which the private sector can compete within the international markets under the market conditions and should absolutely prevent the unregistered economic activities. On the other hand, the private sector should continue taking precautions to increase efficiency; establish strong and transparent balance sheets; shift towards capital markets; pay attention to the principles of risk management and pay effort for the allocation of resources to the research and development activities. Parallel to this, banks should increase their contributions to the sustainability of growth through diversification of credits they offer to the private sector.  Dear Guests, Upon mentioning the growth process in our country, now I would like to dwell on another important item on the agenda, which is employment. Looking at the data about the labor market, we see that the number of the employed has been on the increase as of 2002. This increase is more apparent especially in the sectors other than agriculture. 660 thousand new jobs were created in the last year in the sectors other than agriculture as of September 2006. A comparative improvement in the unemployment figures was recorded parallel to the increase in employment. When compared to the same period of the last year, decreasing by 0.6 points, the unemployment rate became 9.1 percent in September 2006. Nevertheless, these favorable developments in the labor market have not yet arrived at a satisfactory level. The main reason for the delay and weakness of the improvement in the labor market despite the results taken in the other fields of economy are the structural problems in the labor market. Agricultural sector leads the list of these structural problems. A rapid transition process is experienced from the agricultural sector to the sectors other than agriculture as a result of the structural change that the economy goes through. The share of the agricultural sector in total employment decreased from 38 percent in 2001 to 28 percent in September 2006. It is expected that the transition from the agricultural sector to the sectors other than agriculture within the process of structural change in our country will continue in the coming years Additionally, high employment taxes observed in the sectoral structure of employment restricts the rise in employment on the one hand; and causes employment to shift to unregistered activities on the other. The increase in the unregistered employment prevents the increases in employment to be permanent and increases volatility. Working age population keeps growing due to the high rate of population growth in our country. The limited educational facilities to meet the labor power having the demanded qualifications vis-a-vis the increasing working age population and the lack of labor possessing the qualifications compatible with the structural change in the economy are the other problems detaining the possible improvements in the labor market. All these problems prevent the unemployment rates to fall in a speed parallel to the increase in employment. However, the problem of unemployment having social consequences besides economic ones renders the solution of this problem inevitable. Therefore, long-term supply-side policies should be put into effect in order to find a permanent solution to the problem of unemployment. In this respect, via ensuring the implementation of active policies to create employment and providing resources for new investments, the investment atmosphere should be improved by strengthening the relationship between the real and the financial sector. Additionally, educational policies oriented towards increasing the labor power compatible with the labor demand should be put into effect. Besides, having the unregistered employment registered, should be given priority because it leads to unfair competition and this necessitates decreasing the taxes and other burdens on employment gradually. Dear Guests, Finally, I wish to briefly mention current account deficit, which frequently occupies the agenda. Current account deficit is one of the sensitive points of the Turkish economy. With a retrospective look, we see that current account deficit grew faster in the periods when growth rate accelerated due to the structural peculiarities of the Turkish economy. The periods when the current account deficit BIS Review 28/2007 7 
decreased or surpluses were experienced have been the years in which the growth rate decreased or crises broke out. This structure shows us that the current account deficit bears a structural quality rather than a cyclical one. This process can be identified as followings: improvements recorded with respect to the macroeconomic stability decrease the general level of interest rates. This decline in interest rates increase consumption and investment demand and so the credit demand accordingly on the one hand; while leading to a decrease in domestic savings on the other. The rising expenditures, especially the investment spending increase the demand for machinery and equipment; and this demand can be met by imports due to the structural peculiarities of the Turkish economy. This process leads to the enlargement of the difference between the domestic savings and investments, which is an indicator of the current account deficit and causes the need for foreign resources to arise. With the help of the macroeconomic stability and the inflow of foreign capital, Turkish currency is appreciated and the process is reiterated giving way to an increase in the current account deficit in the environments where this resource can be provided and foreign borrowing becomes an option. A similar process was experienced due to the improvements recorded in the macroeconomic stability in the last five years and remarkable increases were observed in the current account deficit owing to the effect of high speed of growth. The current account deficit reached 34.4 billion USD in October per annum and the ratio of the current account deficit to national income in the third quarter of 2006 became 8.5 percent. However, the reasons besides the financing method should be examined in order to determine the extent of the risk that the current account deficit poses with regard to the macroeconomic balances. Current account deficit today basically originates from the faster increase of investments in comparison with the savings. Additionally, high increases observed in energy prices and especially crude oil prices influenced the increase in current account deficit in a vast amount. The calculations point that in the case that energy prices remain fixed at their level of the year 2002, the ratio of the current account deficit to national income will be 3.6 points lower in the third quarter of 2006 compared to its current level. As a result of the process of the structural change and the progress obtained in the macroeconomic conditions in recent years, the quality of financing for the current account deficit improved. Long-term capital has been the prevalent resource of capital inflows as of October 2006 with an annual level of 25.3 billion USD. This figure alone meets 3.4 percent of the current account deficit. Foreign direct investment inflow to our country for the same period was in record levels with 21.4 billion USD per annum. What is worth paying attention here is the lack of an interruption in the foreign direct investments flowing in our country even during the fluctuations experienced in the May-June period. This is an indicator of the improvements recorded in the macroeconomic stability and also the confidence for the future of our economy by the foreign investors. Long-term capital inflows and foreign direct investments finance a vast amount of our current account deficit currently. This financing structure is expected to continue parallel to the implementation of the current program decisively. While analyzing the sustainability of the high current account deficits in our country, it should be noted that the structure of our economy is different from the past. In this context, strengthening of the macroeconomic foundations in the Turkish economy and the gradually increasing financial integration with the world economy facilitates the sustainability of higher current account deficits. Floating rate regime and a strong financial system also alleviates the negative consequences of the current account deficit during a possible capital outflow. The current account deficit is one of the risk factors for our economy today as it was in the past. Management of this risk like the other risks besides its control through medium and long-term structural measures considering its structural peculiarities are vital for the establishment of a permanent stability in the economy. Finally, I would like to express my pleasure one more time for having this opportunity to communicate my views about the policies of the Bank and the macroeconomic developments. Thank you. 8 BIS Review 28/2007 
David Opiokello: Business continuity and risk mananagement regional workshop in Uganda  Speech by Mr David Opiokello, Acting Deputy Governor of the Bank of Uganda, at the opening of the Regional Workshop on Business Continuity and Risk Management, Entebbe, 5 February 2007. *      *      * Distinguished Resource persons Our Colleagues from Bank of Tanzania and Central Bank of Kenya, Reserve Bank of Malawi Directors, Ladies and Gentlemen I would like to take this opportunity to welcome all of you here today. I would most especially like to welcome Mr. Christian Völlmer and Mr. Wolfgang Forttinger from the Centre for Technical Central bank Cooperation at the Deutsche Bundesbank and Mrs. Sue Milton of the Centre For Central Bank Studies (CCBS) at the Bank Of England. The two institutions have partnered with Bank Of Uganda to make this workshop a reality. Mrs. Sue Milton’s pivotal role in putting together this program at the invitation of Bank Of Uganda is especially acknowledged and appreciated. I am also very happy to welcome all the delegates to this workshop and in a special way I would like to recognize our colleagues from the Reserve Bank of Malawi. Reserve Bank Of Malawi is placed in a slightly different position here, because Central Bank of Kenya and Bank Of Tanzania may be considered, within the context of the East African Community, to be joint hosts. Bank Of Uganda attaches great importance to this workshop and this is demonstrated by the fact that the entire senior management team of the Bank have put aside tight schedules for an entire week to attend to this workshop. When Bank of Uganda approached the Centre for Central Bank Studies in 2005 about this program, Bank of Uganda had just adopted a standard approach to risk management in the Bank which came 2 years after the business continuity program that started in 2003. The decision to move along this direction was prompted by the desire to adopt internationally acceptable best practices as well as adhering to good corporate governance. Running parallel to these developments within the Bank of Uganda are the regional efforts towards a common monetary and political union of the countries in the region. To achieve such integration, harmonisation of policies and practices (especially in the Central Banks) has been taken seriously. As such harmonisation demands that cooperating institutions adopt uniform internal procedures, practices and policies on various issues on central banking. Towards this end the Bank of Uganda, Bank of Tanzania and Central Bank of Kenya have, through the Monetary Affairs Committee of the East African Community not only been meeting to take decisions on various policy issues but they have also been conducting joint seminars such as this one to share experiences and learn from one another. This workshop therefore comes at such an opportune moment to assist our central banks to achieve the internal and regional objectives. The workshop offers various opportunities to all of us in a number of ways: • First, this is an opportunity to jointly re-assess and evaluate our performance in the areas of business continuity management and risk management over the period. • Secondly, it provides us with an opportunity to learn from organisations that have run risk management and business continuity programs for many years. • Third, this is an opportunity for each of our Central Banks with programs in their infancy to lay the correct foundation to implement sound and resilient risk management and business continuity programs. • Fourth, this is an opportunity to obtain uniform training for each of the key players in their respective roles. With a common foundation, the objective of harmonisation in the region will draw closer to reality. Bank of Uganda would greatly benefit if the following areas are specifically addressed within this workshop: BIS Review 28/2007 1 
• Performance measurement: what are the key indicators that central bank management should use to know that their business continuity and/or risk management programs are giving them the intended benefits? • Evaluation: How does the central bank evaluate performance over time and which tools are recommended? • Reporting: what should be reported about risk and business continuity at the different levels of the organisation including the Board? • Incident reporting and monitoring: How does the central bank ensure that all risk incidents are systematically reported and monitored? • Culture change: What are the different approaches to organisational culture change towards risk and business continuity? I would like to conclude by again thanking you all for coming to this workshop and to thank the Centre for Central Bank studies and the Centre for Technical Central Bank cooperation for the technical support. Bank of Uganda is greatly indebted to them. I wish you fruitful deliberations. It is now my pleasure to declare this workshop officially opened. 2 BIS Review 28/2007 
Guy Quaden: CashSSP – the cash single shared platform Remarks by Mr Guy Quaden, Governor of the National Bank of Belgium, on the occasion of signing the Cash Single Shared Platform contract between Bank of Finland and the central banks of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, Bank of Finland, Helsinki, 16 March 2007. *      *      * Dear Governor, dear Erkki,  Dear colleagues,  First of all, let me thank you for your kind invitation and for organising this event.  The Eurosystem is an entity which has no equivalent anywhere in the world. For me, the creation of the ECB did not raise any doubts on the usefulness of the NCBs. In fact, the reverse is true. Luxembourg, the only country which did not have its own central bank, had to create one just before the transition to the single monetary policy.  Nevertheless, our integration into the Eurosystem has obviously influenced the life of our institutions. I think on two changes which are not necessarily apparent to the outside world.  The first is due to the fundamental change in the actual role of our NCBs, which now participate in the management of the world's second most important currency. The decisions taken in Frankfurt are taken on a collegiate basis by the Governing Council. This means that every governor of an NCB must be properly prepared to deal with all the issues considered at that level. They concern not only the single monetary policy but also the Eurosystem's other spheres of activity, such as financial stability and payment systems.  In recent years, our NCBs have therefore extended and strengthened their analysis capacity. A large proportion of our staff is nowadays involved at various levels in the preparation of these decisions "taken in Frankfurt". The investment in resources is substantial, and so is the resulting enrichment of the job content of our employees.  The second change concerns operational aspects. One of the Eurosystem's basic operating principles is a high degree of decentralisation. Our NCBs remain the contact points between financial institutions or economic agents of our countries and the Eurosystem. However, the concept of decentralisation has evolved since the Eurosystem was first formed.  To quote the words of the Eurosystem's mission statement: "We are committed to good governance and to performing our tasks effectively and efficiently, in a spirit of cooperation and team work". This is further elaborated in the Organisational Principles, which state "that potential synergies and economies of scale shall be identified and exploited to the extent feasible". Furthermore the Council Task Force of which Erkki is a member has been mandated by the Governing Council "to prepare proposals for discussion and decision on issues related to the role, objectives, functions and operational modalities of the Eurosystem". In my view, it has a crucial role to play as an independent think thank.  Having said that I believe that if the time is not ripe for a top-down decision, there should be room for NCBs – and in particular for medium-sized NCBs – to initiate voluntary collaboration in the development of joint projects and the exploitation of synergies following a bottom up approach. I think also that the long term vision for the Eurosystem calls for a shift from the pure centralisation and decentralisation models that have been applied in the past towards models of pooling and consolidation. In my view, the CASH SSP partnership fits perfectly into this framework. The introduction of euro banknotes provided an excellent opportunity for the NBB to modernise and reengineer its IT-application for cash handling. The goal was twofold: first of all, to manage cash flows more efficiently, both within the central bank and between the central bank and its main customers, financial institutions and cash transport firms; and secondly, to improve the security of these cash transactions.  The successful implementation of this new cash application inspired the Bank's cash department to start thinking about the possibility of promoting it to international scale, starting with the neighbouring central banks. So in 2006 CASH SSP was formally born and the first agreements were signed between the Dutch central bank, the Banque centrale du Luxembourg and the NBB. Today the BIS Review 27/2007 1 
partnership is extended to a fourth partner, which shows that the scope of the business case is larger. Also on behalf of the Dutch central bank and the Banque centrale du Luxembourg let me warmly welcome you as a full and equal partner in the group.  We find it very important that standards are being developed, because this shows to the commercial banks active in several countries, that we exploit a number of synergies of the single currency for cash handling and maybe, dear friends, could you use your privileged relationship with the Baltic countries to see whether other central banks would be interested in such type of collaboration.  From our side, we will continue at the NBB to try to play a pro-active role in promoting collaboration between central banks within the Eurosystem also in other fields like collateral management and statistics. This also implies that the NBB is open to support or participate in initiatives launched by other NCBs in other fields of activity.  A last remark. It is often said that "IT should follow the business". I agree, but both sides should be in permanent contact with each other and look for efficiency gains on the IT side and on the business side, too. Open communication between business and IT is the cornerstone of the CASH SSP partnership as it results in transparency and mutual trust between all partners. In the move towards closer collaboration between Eurosystem central banks, transparency and mutual trust are of utmost importance in promoting a genuine Eurosystem team spirit. This is something that should be supported and it calls for an improved governance framework in order to fully realise efficiency gains for the whole Eurosystem.  Dear colleagues,  The Eurosystem has established itself as a sound system capable of taking well-founded monetary policy decisions. On the operational level, it is now moving towards more specialisation. Tomorrow, our central banks will probably not be performing all the same tasks anymore. Some decisions will be taken following a top-down approach, others will grow from the bottom up. I am convinced that within the Eurosystem, there is, and there should continue to be, an important role for each and every member.  Erkki, let me conclude by once again thanking the Bank of Finland for the warm welcome I have been given here in Helsinki, and that is not just because of the warm winter weather we are having these days. Let me also thank you once more for sharing the vision that the CASH SSP partnership can boost collaboration between Eurosystem central banks, building on the expertise and know-how available across the whole system, something that is fully in line with the team spirit promoted by the ECB Governing Council.  2 BIS Review 27/2007 
T T Mboweni: The benefits of being a good host – the FIFA World Cup and the South African economy Address by Mr T T Mboweni, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, at the Corporatesport Directors’ Dinner, Johannesburg, 20 March 2007. *      *      * Honoured guests Ladies and Gentlemen: 1.  Introduction It is not often that I land up sharing the podium with someone like Mr Jake White, coach of our national rugby team. After all, what does a sports coach and a central bank Governor have in common? This is probably a question that some of you are currently pondering over. Perhaps, one common aspect centres around the target that both of us have. For Mr White it is to win matches and tournaments, while in my case it is to ensure that inflation remains within the target range. There is a subtle difference however. As long as Mr White meets his target, then everyone is happy (apart from the opposition). Meeting the inflation target does not necessarily keep all South Africans happy – this is particularly evident when we have to increase interest rates in order to keep inflationary pressures in check. Consumers, and usually the highly indebted ones, always complain when there are increases in interest rates while pensioners argue that it is a case of too little too late. So the issue of whose job is easier is still very much an open question. However, I am definitely not going to get involved in a scrum or a lineout with Jake in order to answer this question. I have no intention of giving away a penalty, being sin-binned or being cited afterwards. Whatever the case, I do not think that we should swap roles. I don’t know how Mr White would do as a central banker, but I am certain that the national team is better off not having me as their coach. I feel on safer ground sharing a platform with Mr Tim Modise. Both of our jobs involve communication, and he communicates on behalf of a sport that I passionately follow. I am an ardent Kaizer Chiefs supporter, but regrettably we will have to wait till next year for renewed league glory. I am pleased at least that if it is not my team that is leading the pack, it is a team from Tshwane where the Bank is based. I will leave rugby to Mr White, and let me rather use this occasion to highlight some of the economic benefits for South Africa of hosting major international events, in particular sporting events such as the FIFA World Cup.  2.  Hosting of mega events The wave of globalisation that has swept across the world for more than two decades has had an impact on communities beyond the economic and financial spheres. It has also impacted on the way in which global communities interact in areas such as education and sport. As the world becomes increasingly integrated, more opportunities have emerged for countries to host and organise what today have become known as mega events. Since 1994, South Africa has become an important venue for hosting such events. Hosting major sporting, cultural and economic events is of significance for many countries since it can provide an important catalyst for growth and development. As a result of this potential, professionals from various disciplines such as marketing, finance, economics and tourism have shown increased interest in understanding the dynamics of hosting mega events. Today, universities in the United States of America, the United Kingdom and Australia offer courses on various aspects of sport education, including sport marketing and sport tourism. This trend is also becoming evident in South African tertiary education and is likely to intensify in the future.  South Africa has had its fair share of hosting major sporting events since 1994 such as the African Cup of Nations in 1994, the Rugby World Cup in 1995, and the Cricket World Cup in 2003. In addition, South Africa has also hosted major conferences which have attracted global interest. The most important of these have inter alia included the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Growth in 2002 which attracted more than 60 000 delegates, as well as the United Nations Conference on BIS Review 27/2007 1 
Racism in 2001, to mention but a few. Major conference and convention centres have been built in most of our major cities and most of them have had a high degree of utilisation. This year, the South African Reserve Bank in collaboration with the South African National Treasury will be hosting the G-20 meeting of Ministers of Finance and Central Bank Governors. Preparations for this meeting will be ongoing for most of the year. Preparatory meetings are held both in South Africa and other member countries. These events will attract high level officials to South Africa from the world’s most important economies. Three major meetings will be held in South Africa during the course of this year. Apart from successfully hosting these events, South Africa has also bid to host the two most important global sporting spectaculars, namely the 2006 FIFA World Cup finals and Cape Town’s bid to host the 2004 Olympic Games. South Africa narrowly failed to win these bids, but fortunately our second attempt to host the FIFA World Cup finals was successful and as you all know, we will be hosting the event in 2010. 3.  The economic implications of hosting mega events There has been growing interest in the economic consequences of hosting mega events. The economic advantages of hosting such events do not automatically outweigh the costs. In an environment of scarce resources, the opportunity costs of hosting mega events always attract close scrutiny. Governments are generally required to commit considerable resources to hosting these events; resources that could have been used elsewhere in the economy. In some instances, this may involve an acceleration of spending, an additional allocation or a diversion of expenditure from other uses or regions. For example, a successful bid for the 2004 Olympic Games could have seen resources being diverted from other areas of the country to Cape Town, whereas the World Cup games should see a wider distribution of benefits.  A further problem relates to correctly estimating the costs. For example, it was reported last Thursday that the expected cost of the London Olympic Games in 2012 is already more than four times higher than estimated at the time of the successful bid. Finally, these costs have to be weighed up against the expected revenue and other positive spin-offs, which are also difficult to quantify. In many instances, the revenue stream remains long after the event is held, but so does the financing of the costs. Numerous studies have been commissioned in various countries to determine the economic and financial implications of hosting mega events See Bohlmann H R: Predicting the Economic Impact of the 2010 FIFA World Cup on South Africa. May, 2005. University of Pretoria. Working paper 2006-11, for a review of these studies. The Montreal Olympic Games in 1976 are considered by many to have been an economic and financial failure. Hosting the Olympics in Montreal plunged the city into a huge debt burden which was only repaid in full in recent years. Similarly, studies have shown that the benefits to Korea from hosting the FIFA World Cup finals in 2002 fell far short of initial expectations. The country was left with an over-supply of large stadiums, some of which have subsequently been demolished.  Notwithstanding these negative outcomes, most countries reap a positive net benefit from hosting these events. The broad conclusion is that proper planning for mega events tends to generate positive spin-offs both in the short and long run. A study conducted by the Los Angeles Sports and Entertainment Commission following the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games estimated that income from tourism increased by almost US$9 billion as a result of hosting the games. The study concluded that hosting major events could be beneficial to cities if carefully planned. The Barcelona Olympic Games of 1988 are today considered a model of how to plan for a mega event. The Barcelona Games were integrated into an urban renewal strategy and the economic outcome of Barcelona hosting the Olympic Games was significant. Unemployment in Barcelona was reduced significantly from 18.4 per cent to 9.6 per cent between 1986 and 1992 and from 20.9 per cent to 15.5 per cent in the country as a whole. Overall growth in Barcelona is said to have increased at a pace never seen before, even a decade after hosting the Games.  Similarly, the Sydney Olympic Games which took place in 2000 were planned in such a way as to generate positive spin-offs well beyond the actual event. In the case of Sydney, city planners focused on infrastructural development of the venues for the games such that these venues could be used for 2 BIS Review 27/2007 
subsequent sporting events. It has been claimed that the Sydney Olympic Games were beyond a sporting triumph.  As we are all aware, South Africa has won the 2010 FIFA World Cup finals bid and preparations to host this event are in progress. There is considerable reputational risk associated with the hosting of the 2010 World Cup finals, and the success of the World Cup finals in Germany puts even more pressure on us to raise the bar. We stand to benefit from the experience and advice of countries that have successfully hosted similar events. As I noted earlier, we have already hosted numerous events, although none perhaps on the scale of the FIFA World Cup finals. Research has shown that South Africa also stands to benefit from hosting the 2010 FIFA World Cup finals. According to a Grant Thornton study conducted in 2003, the event is expected to contribute about R21 billion for the economy as a whole, generate about R7 billion in tax revenue and create about 150 000 jobs. It is not possible to fully and accurately estimate the potential gains to the economy from hosting the World Cup finals ex-ante. However, there is little doubt that with proper planning and interventions by all the relevant stakeholders the potential benefits can be maximised. The spin-offs in terms of tourism, communications and television technology, transport infrastructure to name but a few are significant. Tourism has become an increasingly important source of revenue to the economy and now accounts for about 10 per cent of total export receipts, almost double that of 10 years ago. This number is expected to increase further as a result of the World Cup finals. 4.  Growth and investment in South Africa Preparations for the World Cup come at a time when the economy has been experiencing strong economic growth. The persistent adherence to prudent macroeconomic policies by the authorities has resulted in the country’s solid economic performance in recent years. South Africa has experienced the longest upswing in its business cycle lasting almost 7.5 years to date. The average growth rate between 1994 and 2003 measured around 3 per cent, but in the last 3 years, growth has averaged 5 per cent. In the fourth quarter of 2006, annualised growth measured 5,6 per cent. The growth has been spread across all sectors of the economy with the exception of agriculture. Underpinning this strong growth has been a positive trend in investment growth. It is of interest to note that gross fixed capital formation as a ratio to GDP was around 12 per cent at the beginning of the decade. It is now around 19 per cent. This is a significant shift in the economy which we should not lose sight of, and a trend that is likely to continue in the light of the Government’s Asgisa growth strategy. Central to this strategy is a strong focus on infrastructural investment. As indicated in the latest Budget Review, government and public enterprise infrastructure expenditure over the next 3 years is estimated to amount to R416 billion. This investment should not only raise current growth, but will also allow for sustained future growth over the medium to long term through improved transport, communication and electricity provision. These improvements are expected to ease bottlenecks to current and future growth and exports. This is particularly the case when it comes to investment in transport infrastructure, whether rail, air, road or the ports.  Government has made special budgetary allocations totaling R8,4 billion for the building of stadiums. This is in addition to what municipalities have committed. Furthermore, over R9 billion will be allocated by national government for municipal transport, roads and precinct upgrades relating to the Word Cup games. Apart from these budget provisions, the investment requirements for the event dovetail well with the planned infrastructural investment over the next few years. The 2010 World Cup finals will help to maintain the focus on infrastructural and investment expenditure projects such as the Gautrain, new stadiums and communications technology, to name a few. Much needed airport expansions are also taking place in anticipation of an influx of tourists for this event. As noted in the latest Budget speech by the Minister of Finance, the impetus provided by the World Cup has resulted in a revolution in municipal planning for public transport and forward thinking about urban development.  5.  The World Cup and monetary policy Where does monetary policy fit in to all of this? Of course, when the World Cup finals begin in 2010 we will be keen spectators and supporters of Bafana Bafana, but there is not much we can do to directly impact on the fortunes of the team. I will leave that in the capable hands of Mr Carlos Parreira and his team. We have to keep our eyes on a different ball and a different goal. Through this exciting growth BIS Review 27/2007 3 
phase that we are experiencing, monetary policy has to ensure that inflation is kept under control. In other words we have to ensure that we maintain inflation within the 3-6 per cent target for CPIX.  Excessively high growth brings with it potential inflationary pressures which monetary policy has to be sensitive to. In economic parlance, this refers to the output gap, which is the difference between the potential non-inflationary output of the economy and actual output. From a monetary policy perspective, we have to determine whether the growth we are experiencing is purely cyclical. If this is the case, we are likely to experience inflationary pressures which would require a reaction on our part. However if the current growth trend is structural, that is, if it reflects an increase in the potential output of the economy then these developments are not necessarily inflationary and are sustainable. Unfortunately, estimating potential output is not a simple task and estimates are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. Our view is that in the light of the enormous structural changes and productivity growth in the economy, much of the higher growth we have experienced in recent years is of a structural nature. Current research in the Bank estimates that the potential output of the economy is now at least around 4,5 per cent or more. This can be compared to estimates of around 3 per cent or less during the 1990s. We appear to be well on the way to achieving the 6 per cent sustainable growth that Asgisa is targeting, and the spin-offs from events such as the FIFA games will go a long way towards ensuring that this is a sustainable story. At the same time, monetary policy will have to remain vigilant to ensure that growth occurs in a stable macroeconomic environment of price stability.  6.  Growth and the current account of the balance of payments One of the consequences of high growth and investment has been an expanding deficit on the current account of the balance of payments. In recent months, international financial markets have viewed current account deficit countries as being more vulnerable to capital movements and consequently to exchange rate adjustments. Current account deficits in excess of 6 per cent of GDP have appeared in South Africa during the course of last year and caused quite a bit of excitement in the analyst community. In the fourth quarter of last year we experienced a significant widening in the current account deficit, with the deficit on the trade account of the balance of payments having more than doubled from the third to the fourth quarter of 2006. As we noted in the last MPC statement, much of the import momentum in the fourth quarter, however, can be ascribed to the 140 per cent increase in the volume of oil imports compared to the third quarter. It is important to highlight that the related inventory build-up appears to be exceptional and it is unlikely that oil imports will be sustained at these levels. In fact, had there been the normal import volumes of oil during the final quarter of last year, the deficit-to-GDP ratio for that quarter would have been comfortably less than 6 per cent of GDP. South Africa has been able to finance the current account deficit with relative ease precisely because of the positive growth prospects in South Africa. It also needs to be pointed out that the current account deficit also represents the other side of the coin of robust capital expenditure and the growth the country has been experiencing. A substantial part of increased imports have been capital goods and intermediate goods, which will contribute to the increase in the productive capacity of the economy and increased exports going forward.  The MPC will continue to monitor the developments around the current account deficit and the potential risk to the inflation outlook stemming from possible currency depreciation. It is, however, important for the market to analyse the drivers of the current account deficit, understand the underlying trends and qualitative dimensions rather than to concentrate on what the mere figure as a percentage of GDP is and possibly draw inappropriate conclusions. 7.  Conclusion There is a big difference between winning the bid for the World Cup finals, and adequately preparing for this event. While we cannot afford to be complacent, I am convinced that South Africa has what it takes to successfully host this event and to reap positive benefits for the economy as a whole. We should embrace the opportunities of hosting mega events as part of the process of creating more opportunities for all of our citizens. The World Cup finals attract a huge global audience, apart from the actual visitors, and such exposure can only be positive for the country. 4 BIS Review 27/2007 
Finally, we have a busy sporting year ahead of us, with the current cricket world cup games on the go, and the rugby World Cup finals just around the corner. In monetary policy decision making, we rely somewhat on our forecasts for inflation. My current central forecast is that both the cricket and rugby teams are going to do well this year. As with any forecast, we have to assess the risks to the forecast. In both cases I would venture to say that the risks are firmly on the positive side, and that there is a good probability that we will be showing off two lots of silverware by the end of this year. Allow me to wish Mr White and the Springboks all the best in their endeavours in the rugby World Cup finals in France. We are fully behind you and believe that you have what it takes to bring the cup home. You dare not disappoint the people of South Africa. I thank you. BIS Review 27/2007 5 
Tarisa Watanagase: The prospects of the Thai economy and monetary policy Speech by Dr Tarisa Watanagase, Governor of the Bank of Thailand, at the Japanese Chamber of Commerce (Bangkok) Dinner Talk, Bangkok, 16 March 2007. *      *      * President Banno, fellow bankers, distinguished business leaders, ladies and gentlemen, good evening. "First of all, I would like to thank the Japanese Chamber of Commerce (JCC) for inviting me to speak at this dinner." Japan's relationship with Thailand has a long history and encompasses many aspects – as a trading partner, investor and major contributor to Thailand's economic development. Japan is ranked as Thailand's number one trading partner and investor. In 2006, Japan contributed 16.3 percent to Thailand's total trade, while net foreign direct investment (FDI) from Japan constituted 32.6 percent of Thailand's total net FDI inflows. It is therefore my pleasure to be here and share my views on the Thai economy – the outlook and challenges, as well as our monetary policy, with all of you. I would like to structure my talk to cover three key areas. First, I will touch briefly on the overall condition of the economy. Secondly, and in relation to the first one, I will elaborate on recent monetary policy decisions. Finally, before concluding, I will share my views on the prospects and challenges facing the Thai economy. Let me begin with the economy. The past year was one of the more challenging times for Thailand, in terms of both political and economic aspects. On the economic side, uncertainties heightened because of both external and internal factors. The impending threat of global imbalance became even more pronounced. The dwindling confidence in the US dollar continued, which brought about massive capital inflows into the region, resulting in an across-the-board currency appreciation. At the same time, rising oil prices continued to put pressure on inflation during the first half of 2006. Consumer and investor confidence, meanwhile, was clouded by lingering political uncertainties that brought about delays in consumption and investment decisions, as well as in government spending. As domestic demand weakened, export became the main driver of the Thai economic growth. Despite the negative environment, the overall economic performance was quite satisfactory. The economy proved to be resilient, as the growth momentum continued while overall economic stability improved. Regarding internal stability, headline inflation came down from a peak of 6 percent in the second quarter of 2006 to 3.3 percent in the last quarter and to 2.3 percent in February this year. Core inflation fell from its peak of 2.9 percent in April 2006 to 1.4 percent in February – well within our target range. Overall external stability remained sound. The current account turned into surplus since August and registered a surplus of 1.2 billion US dollars in December 2006, or an overall surplus of 1.5 percent of GDP for the year 2006. Meanwhile, reserves to short-term debt also rose further. The economy registered a growth rate of 5 percent in 2006, a respectable number, against the backdrop of external and internal disturbances. The recent slowdown in consumption and investment could be traced to the confidence factor. Political uncertainties and the unwarranted strengthening of the currency that prompted the introduction of reserve requirements on short-term capital inflows, together with the amendment of the Foreign Business Act that, unfortunately, happened successively within such a short period of time, all had a negative effect on consumer and business confidence. However, we believe that the momentum has not been lost, and uncertainties only postponed consumption and investment decisions. Evidently, retained earnings to total assets averaging over Q1-Q3 of 2006 was at 17.6 percent, higher than the average of 13.3 percent in 2005, while capacity utilization rose to 74.2 percent in 2006, indicating that further investment in production capacity should be in the pipeline. To sum up, while challenges abound, we have weathered them relatively well so far. This can be attributed to a fine combination of the economy's resiliency and appropriate policy stance. By appropriate policy stance, we refer to the “right” policy for the “right” reason at the “right” time. BIS Review 27/2007 1 
Let's now turn to our monetary policy. Monetary policy's main objective is to maintain monetary stability. By this we mean price stability and confidence in the value of the currency. Thailand has adopted inflation targeting since May 2000. Under inflation targeting, the emphasis is given to maintaining core inflation within the target range and, at the same time, achieving a balanced growth path. We use the 1-day repurchase rate as a policy instrument to keep the quarterly average of core inflation within the target range of 0-3.5 percent. If inflationary pressure heightens and thereby increases the possibility of core inflation breaching the target, interest rate has to be raised. Bearing in mind that a time lag of 4-8 quarters before a change in the policy rate can be fully transmitted to the rest of the economy, policy consideration needs to be forward-looking. Upward inflationary pressure over the past few years, due to higher oil prices, has been tamed by monetary tightening. We raised the policy rate 13 times between August 2004 and June 2006, bringing the policy rate to 5.00 percent from 1.25 percent per annum. Hikes in the policy rate have brought the money market and commercial bank interest rates higher over the past 2 years. Our policy response proved timely, with inflation and its second round effects well contained. Recently, domestic demand, particularly in private consumption and investment, showed signs of a slowdown, while economic momentum from exports was expected to moderate, given the prospects of the global economy in 2007. Since inflationary pressures have subsided in line with easing energy prices, monetary policy could be eased in support of a further expansion of the economy. The MPC, thus, lowered the 1-day repurchase rate, the policy rate, to 4.75 on 17 January meeting and a further 25 basis points reduction on 28 February and expect to pursue a downward path of interest rate in a cautious manner. This accommodative monetary policy stance will help stimulate domestic demand by supporting economic sentiments, cutting down financial costs and preparing the stage for private investment recovery once confidence has returned, most likely in the 2nd half of this year. Having considered the recent economic conditions and monetary policy, we will now turn to the prospects and challenges of the Thai economy as we move forward, and how we are going to deal with them. Ladies and gentlemen, for this year, we expect the economy to continue facing a number of important challenges both internally and externally. Internally, political uncertainties, which have adversely affected private sector's decision to invest, are likely to stay until the next general election. Externally, the threat of an impending global imbalance remains high, while the global economy is expected to slow down. Moreover, the risk from volatile global financial markets lingers, while the baht could continue to appreciate against the US dollar. It may be a great concern to you whether the Thai economy will be resilient enough to withstand such an adverse environment. However, we believe that sound fundamentals and the appropriate policy stance would prepare the economy well in the long term.  Facing internal challenges, the monetary policy stance has become more accommodative as mentioned earlier. The reduction in the policy rate has been effectively transmitted into lower money market rates as well as lower commercial banks' retail rates. To date, 4 major Thai commercial banks have reduced their deposit rates and 3 of them have cut down their lending rates. The downward interest rate path should help improve sentiments and lower the cost of funds, which would support the recovery in domestic demand, particularly, investment. The outlook for the Thai economy within the next few years remains positive. The BoT's forecasts, having incorporated the aforementioned risks, show that the Thai economy should be growing by 4-5 percent in 2007 and by 4-5.5 percent in 2008. Such growth rates are respectable in light of these challenges. Regarding the challenge arising from the volatile global financial market and an appreciation of the baht, Thailand, with a relatively small and still shallow financial market like many emerging market economies, is vulnerable to the fast-moving international capital. Rapid movements of capital flows can have negative impacts on the export or import sectors, which could pass on the adverse effects to the real sector and financial sector and eventually jeopardizing economic stability. The rapid appreciation of the baht particularly in the last quarter of last year, which proved to be inconsistent with economic fundamentals and much out-of-line with the rest of the region, inevitably forced the Bank of Thailand to implement a reserve requirement on capital inflows to break the rapid one-way momentum and preserve overall stability after several capital account measures proved unsuccessful. 2 BIS Review 27/2007 
Ladies and gentlemen. I would like to reassure you that we have always welcomed genuine foreign capital flows and investors and will continue to do so. The measure implemented in December was not meant to affect genuine investors and this was clear from the beginning. The measure announced on 18th of December clearly stated that capital inflow in the form of foreign direct investment (FDI) was exempted from the reserve requirement. And later on, as it turned out that genuine flows were still affected by the measure, we attempted to find an alternative option to alleviate pressure on the baht and adverse effects on productive sectors. To date, the exchange control measure has effectively slowed down the appreciation of the baht. On average, the nominal effective exchange rate in February strengthened by only 0.5% relative to January, compared to an appreciation of 1.7% between November 2006 and the first half of December – before the measure was implemented. After we have successfully slowed down the one-way appreciation momentum, we have allowed greater flexibility to the measure without compromising the needs to contain excessive volatility – by providing the fully-hedging option for all categories of inflows that are covered under the reserve requirement measure. We will closely monitor the hedging requirement. If its implementation is effective, we can lift the reserve requirement and keep only the hedging requirement. In safeguarding economic stability and fostering long term growth, the BoT also looks beyond the immediate horizon. However, to overcome the challenge of global dynamism over the long run, monetary and financial stability alone are not sufficient. The challenge here is for the Thai economy to make sustainable gains in productivity through increased flexibility, efficiency, and competitiveness amidst the dynamic global economic conditions and structure. In this respect, we need to promote a sound and stable macroeconomic environment by carrying out necessary reforms in the real sector and financial sector. The real sector must work continuously in improving productivity to enhance its competitiveness. So far, reform efforts from both the private and public sectors have been made to promote transparency, strengthen governance and improve the quality of human resources. In the long term, the government plans to embark on key infrastructure investment projects, which include the expansion of the mass transit network in Bangkok, water resource management, and an integrated logistics system. These public investments will ease bottle-necks without exerting too much pressure on external stability and allow firms to focus on improving their efficiency and productivity. On the financial sector, the Bank of Thailand has played an important role in strengthening the financial infrastructure. The Financial Sector Master Plan (FSMP), in place since 2002, will move into its second phase. FSMP aims to broaden access to financial services to all potential users, promote competition in financial services in order to enhance financial efficiency and resiliency and ensure that our financial sector can perform well in the global competitive environment. We have already seen significant consolidation and increased efficiency of the banking sector as the first phase of FSMP ended. In addition to FSMP, the amendments and introduction of a number of legislations, such as the new Financial Institutions Act and the Deposit Insurance Act, will foster a more efficient financial sector. On the supervisory side, we have also continued our efforts to enhance financial sector's resiliency to unfavorable disturbances through an early adoption of IAS 39, currently underway, and the new Basel Capital Accord at the end of next year. FSMP and improved supervision will complement structural reforms in the real sector to bring about strong foundations for further economic growth and stability. Structural reforms in the real sector continue to need concerted efforts from both the private and public sectors as well as support from foreign investors like all of you here. The BoT is committed to doing all the necessary work for a strong financial sector that will provide a supportive environment and infrastructure for the private sector to prosper. Ladies and gentlemen, the essence of my talk today is to reassure you that the performance of the Thai economy has been satisfactory and that, despite the adverse environment and challenges facing the Thai economy, I strongly believe that the Thai economy will be able to continue to perform favorably while moving forward. We are strongly committed to implementing the most appropriate policies to help foster growth, stability and resiliency of the economy and to further strengthen its solid foundation. In closing, I would like to express my appreciation to Japanese businesses for their contribution to the progress of the Thai economy over the years. Here's hoping that we continue to build and strengthen the foundation of this great relationship.  Again, I am deeply grateful for this opportunity, and thank you for your kind attention.

T T Mboweni: The role of the South African Reserve Bank in the protection of consumers Address by Mr T T Mboweni, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, at the National Consumer Forum Conference to celebrate World Consumer Rights Day, Johannesburg, 15 March 2007.  *      *      * Honoured Guests, Ladies and gentlemen 1.  Introduction Thank you for the invitation to address you on the occasion of the celebration of World Consumers Rights Day. As consumers we often forget that we have rights, and it is often said that South African consumers are among the most apathetic when it comes to asserting their rights. Consumers are the reason for the existence of business, and World Consumer Rights Day accordingly deservers our support. The relevance of the theme of this conference; “holding the public and private sectors accountable” is without question. The South African Reserve Bank plays an important role in the South African economy, and our actions impact directly on consumers. It is therefore essential that institutions such as the South African Reserve Bank are fully accountable to consumers for the autonomy they enjoy. In my address to you this afternoon, I will expand on the role of the South African Reserve Bank, particularly with respect to the consumer, and, in line with the theme of the conference, I will highlight our efforts to ensure full accountability.  2.  Monetary policy and the consumer The South African Reserve Bank, like central banks in other countries, has a unique position in the economy. The operations of the Bank are governed in terms of the South African Reserve Bank Act, its associated regulations and the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa. The Act and regulations describe the framework and structure of the Bank, the way in which it is managed and the actions it may take. The Constitution prescribes that the objective of the Bank should be the protection of the currency in the interest of sustainable economic growth and development.  The Bank interprets this mandate to be the achievement and maintenance of price stability. In February 2000 an inflation targeting framework was adopted in South Africa with the inflation target being set by the Government. The Bank, therefore, in line with most inflation targeting central banks, does not have goal independence. However, in its pursuit of this target, the Bank is guaranteed operational or instrument independence. In other words, we can apply our interest rate policy without interference from government. In terms of our mandate, we have to keep CPIX inflation, (i.e. headline consumer price inflation excluding mortgage interest costs) between 3 to 6 per cent per annum on a continuous basis. In carrying out our mandate, we have a direct impact on the consumer through the impact of monetary policy on inflation and interest rates. The question we are often asked is, why target inflation? Low inflation is in the interest of all South Africans, irrespective of whether they are consumers, business people, or retirees. Inflation, which is a continuous increase in the general price level, implies a continuous decline in the value of money, which implies an erosion of the purchasing power of consumers. The Bank aims to limit such a decline by achieving price stability. However, it is important to note that price stability does not imply that the prices of goods and services do not change at all. Relative prices in a market economy will always change in response to changes in relative scarcities, for example after a drought, food prices are likely to increase.  It is also generally the case that those consumers most vulnerable to the ravages of inflation are the poor. The wealthy members of society are in a better position to hedge against inflation for example by borrowing money to buy non-monetary assets. The wealthy often have assets that can more easily be protected against expected inflation.  BIS Review 26/2007 1 
Inflation has other adverse effects such as the distortion of the tax system, and also results in increased uncertainty which makes economic decision-making more difficult. High inflation is usually also accompanied by greater price variability. The confusing price signals make the price system less efficient, and the result is lower levels of investment and growth. We are also often asked why employment or economic growth is not the primary objective of monetary policy. As noted in the Constitution, inflation is not an objective in itself, but is in the interest of sustained growth. It goes without saying that the target of monetary policy should be something that monetary policy can achieve. It is the view of the Bank that although monetary policy can impact on cyclical unemployment and growth, it cannot determine long-run trend real growth. Growth in the long run is determined by real variables and other supply-side factors, including government policies and the general macroeconomic environment that monetary policy contributes to. Monetary policy plays an important role in shaping the macroeconomic environment in which economic agents operate. The best contribution that monetary policy can make is to provide a low and stable inflation environment that is conducive to sustainable long-term growth.  The main monetary policy tool at the disposal of the Bank is the interest rate. Essentially the Bank sets the repo rate, which is the rate at which the banks borrow from us, and this in turn affects other interest rates in the economy. It could be seen as somewhat ironical that in order to protect the consumer from inflation, the means to achieve this are likely to impact negatively on consumers through higher interest rates. Unfortunately, on the part of the Bank there is no way to avoid this.  At times, the increase in interest rates to keep inflationary pressures in check has drawn some criticism particularly by borrowers who were not expecting such increases. I should note however, that depositors or savers are happy when interest rates increase. Perhaps more publicity is given to the plight of those who are negatively affected by interest rate changes. It should be emphasised that the Bank acts in the interest of all consumers, irrespective of whether they are borrowers or depositors, by setting interest rates at an appropriate level to ensure that the inflation target is achieved. Low inflation allows for generally lower nominal interest rates. Furthermore, as the Bank builds up credibility for its inflation-fighting policies, interest rate cycles are likely to have a lower amplitude. Hopefully the strong interest rate cycles we have seen in the 1980s and 1990s are a thing of the past. By achieving sustained low inflation, we believe that interest rate adjustments can be more moderate and more certainty will result for both consumers and producers. Ultimately we would like to achieve a virtuous circle of low inflation, moderate interest rate cycles and high and sustained economic growth. At times it is possible that the actions of consumers could threaten the inflation target, and it our responsibility to take appropriate action. In the past three years we have seen household consumption expenditure increasing to extremely high levels. Credit extension by banks has been rising at very high rates, and household indebtedness has also increased to record highs. Some of this can be explained by a number of positive developments in the economy apart from lower interest rates. These include stronger household balance sheets, higher real incomes and increased employment. Our monetary policy actions in the second half of last year were in part an attempt to dampen the inflationary potential of this higher consumption expenditure.  There are other dangers emanating from excessive borrowing, particularly when interest rates start to rise and consumers find themselves overcommitted. In accepting credit, consumers should understand their rights and not fall prey to aggressive marketing of credit. For this reason we are gratified that the banks have adopted a code of good conduct in the marketing of credit. The National Credit Act, to be implemented in the middle of this year will provide further protection to consumers. There are however always two sides to every transaction, and consumers should also act responsibly when taking on further debt. 3.  Accountability of the Bank As noted earlier, our operational mandate is to keep CPIX inflation between 3 to 6 per cent and the Bank has autonomy in the conduct of monetary policy. It is well recognised that autonomy goes hand in hand with accountability. Thus, one of the primary measures of accountability relates to how the bank has performed in relation to its operational mandate.  Monetary policy has been successful in achieving the inflation target since September 2003 when CPIX moved to within the target range. This allowed for a reduction in the repo rate by 650 basis points between June 2003 and April 2005. In 2006, in response to perceived risks to the inflation 2 BIS Review 26/2007 
outlook, the Monetary Policy Committee increased the repo rate by 50 basis points at four consecutive meetings from June. Despite this adjustment, economic growth has remained strong and we expect growth rates of around 5 per cent to be sustained. Although monetary policy cannot claim all the credit, its contribution to the economy’s robust growth performance over the last couple of years is well recognised in many circles. Our accountability extends beyond simply achieving the inflation target. Since the announcement of an inflation target in South Africa, any ambiguity about the ultimate goal of monetary policy has been removed. The smooth conduct of an inflation targeting framework implies a great deal of trust and confidence on the part of the public in a central bank’s ability and determination to achieve the target. Without this credibility in the eyes of the public, a central bank’s policy goal is not easily achievable. Since the introduction of an inflation targeting policy framework, the Bank has introduced a number of initiatives to improve transparency and communication with all its stakeholders to enhance the credibility of monetary policy. In fact, communication plays an important role in fulfilling the Bank’s obligation of accountability. For example, decisions of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) are announced after each meeting at a televised media conference, where the motivation for the decision is explained. Media representatives also have an opportunity to question the monetary policy decision and the policy stance. The publication of a bi-annual Monetary Policy Review also broadens the understanding of the aims and conduct of monetary policy. The Review analyses developments in and factors influencing inflation, assesses recent policy developments and considers the outlook for inflation. In conjunction with statements after MPC meetings, this publication sheds more light on monetary policy deliberations.  Monetary policy and broader economic issues are discussed with stakeholders at Monetary Policy Forums, hosted bi-annually in Bloemfontein, Cape Town, Durban, East London, Gauteng, Kimberley, Mafikeng, Polokwane, Port Elizabeth and Nelspruit. These Forums provide for discussions on monetary policy over a broad geographical spectrum and involve a large cross-section of stakeholders, including trade union representatives, analysts, academics, the media and the general public. The Bank is ultimately accountable to Parliament as the representative body of all the people in South Africa, and an annual report is submitted to Parliament. I also meet periodically with members of the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Finance. After the publication of the Bank’s Quarterly Bulletin, a presentation is made to the Committee highlighting the contents of the Bulletin, and I answer questions put by the Committee. In addition to our accountability to Parliament, we also report to our shareholders. The Bank has had shareholders since its inception in 1921, but the legislation is drafted in such a way that no single shareholder can exercise any undue influence over the activities of the Bank. The structure of shareholders adds an additional degree of accountability, in as much as the Bank publishes an Annual Report that is tabled, discussed and approved at the Annual General Meeting of shareholders. The Bank publishes an abridged version of the annual Governor’s Address to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in six official languages of South Africa in a variety of newspapers and magazines. This ensures that the Address is accessible to all stakeholders in the Bank.  The importance of communication within an inflation targeting framework is without question. Communication is a critical part of monetary policy since it can lead to more effective policy by influencing expectations. The challenge for the Bank is to ensure maximum efficiency and consistency of its communication. As I have outlined, it is clear that the communications strategy of the Bank is directed at a broad spectrum of individuals and institutions. From time to time our actions may be misinterpreted or misunderstood but we shall nevertheless endeavour to undertake whatever communication is necessary to ensure that the trust of the general public in the Bank is maintained. 4.  Conclusion The Constitution does not deal specifically with the rights of consumers, but deals with the rights of consumers to meet their basic needs which include adequate food, clothing, drinking water, electricity, education, health care and shelter. The National Consumer Forum identifies some important rights of the consumer that supports their endeavours to achieve their basic needs. These range from educational rights to ensure informed decision making on the part of consumers to the rights of BIS Review 26/2007 3 
individuals to raise views on matters of concern to consumers. The choice of a variety of quality goods and services at competitive prices has also been identified by National Consumer Forum as one of the fundamental rights of consumers. The mandate of the Bank of maintaining price stability, that is keeping inflation at low levels, goes a long way toward ensuring competitive pricing practices in the South African economy.  I thank you. 4 BIS Review 26/2007 
Shamshad Akhtar: Pakistan – regulatory and supervisory framework Speech by Dr Shamshad Akhtar, Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, at the Institute of International Bankers Annual Washington Conference, Washington DC, 5 March 2007. *      *      * I. Introduction  Pakistan’s financial sector has undergone a phenomenal structural change. Key elements of this change are:  (i) Privatization of banking industry which only 6 years or so back was 90% in public sector-privatization was accompanied by significant debt and labor resolution and restructuring,  (ii) Free and flexible entry of foreign banks raising foreign shareholding to almost half of the banking sector assets,  (iii) Development of a strong banking system as capital base has strengthened and the ratio of Net NPLs to Net Loans today is at an all time low of 1.8% for all banks and 1.3% for commercial banks.  (iv) Enhancement in financial depth and private credit ratio – there is however considerable room for further expansion of these indicators,  (v) Substantial credit diversification at sector levels which is helping support broad based economic activity,  (vi) Strengthening of regulatory and supervisory framework along with the stricter enforcement by a vigilant and strong central bank that is fully independent and accountable to its Board, and  (vii) Changed perception and approaches to safety net for depositors and prompt corrective actions. With most banking system now in private hands, the government’s implicit guarantee for deposit no longer exists and now the owners and the Board of Directors as wells as top management of a bank are liable for their actions. Notwithstanding, central banks surveillance system plays a key role in identification of the problems, e.g. threat to capital, liquidity crisis at the earliest stage, and execution of prompt corrective action – the objective being to curb the problem at the onset, and if required appointing official liquidators for settlement of depositors’ claims in a timely manner, in cases where the corrective actions result in liquidation/restructuring of the bank. The trends and performance of banking sector has been influenced by a variety of factors, in particular higher and sustainable economic growth supported by effective macroeconomic management and comprehensive and sophisticated prudential regulatory and supervisory (PRS) framework. In designing PRS, central bank has been realistic and rigorous, while recognizing need for flexibility so critical given the characteristics, structure and state of financial sector and the prevailing governance and market practices. Adopted effective January 2004, the PRS has since continuously been updated substantively to respond to the emerging developments in the sector and to conform to the International standards.  Pakistan’s PRS aims to: promote and preserve financial sector stability, encourages banks to function purely on market principles and operate in a fair and efficient manner guided by high standards of corporate governance with emphasis on complete disclosure and transparency. To ensure effectiveness of this framework, central bank has now put in place an elaborate framework of banking surveillance and supervision.  In setting this PRS, the main challenge has been to evolve and develop a well balanced PRS which allows for (i) an open, liberal and competitive neutrality of regulatory framework that promotes financial sector growth, diversification, and innovation, (ii) healthy competition and risk taking to ensure a sustainable and aggressive income stream, and (iii) opportunities for enhancing the franchise value of banks. On the other hand, it is critical for regulatory framework to recognize the need for augmenting more prudent behavior and ensuring effective risk management especially critical in fast expanding financial markets and also safeguarding social obligations and consumer interests. By and large Pakistan’s PRS is now market friendly and all credit and lending cum deposit rate prescriptions and BIS Review 26/2007 1 
dictates have been withdrawn and banks are now free to operate as long as they comply with regulatory framework.  II. Regulatory framework Recognizing the ground realities, Pakistan’s financial regulatory framework at this stage restricts banks from engaging in non-related commercial activities to avoid conflicts of interest between banks and diverse businesses such as securities and insurance underwriting, and real estate investment etc. This is largely done to avoid at this stage the complexities emerging from cross ownership and large conglomerates. Except in case of multilateral borrowings, banks are generally prohibited from assuming any obligation or guarantees on behalf of Non-bank Financial Institutions (NBFIs).  Banks and development finance institutions (DFIs) exposure to equity market is governed by a PR which disallows exposures against the security issued by the bank itself or those by prospective borrowers themselves or provide unsecured credit to finance the floatation of securities or take exposure against non-listed securities and sponsor directors’ shares. Banks investment in any single scrip is limited to 5% of their own equity with total investment in listed shares is capped at 20%. The margin requirement against the security of shares of listed companies has been set at 30%. Notwithstanding these broader restrictions banks are allowed to set up or take higher stakes in their subsidiaries that can be formed for specified purposes like asset management, brokerage, etc.. This allows banks to diversify their business interests but operating as a separate business entity.  Consistent with normal practices, the regulatory framework for banks is all encompassing and covers a broad spectrum of elements which can be classified in six different categories defining; (i) entry requirements, (ii) risk management guidelines, (iii) corporate governance framework, (iv) industry specific guidelines, (v) operational guidelines and (iv) anti money laundering regime. Bank entry and licensing requirements. SBP has the sole authority to set criteria and approve or transfer ownership of bank licensing. Presently, banks/DFIs are required to, in a phased manner, to meet capital requirements which have reached $50 million as of December 2006 and will be doubled to $100 million by 31 December 2009. Among others, higher capital requirements are intended to accelerate the process of banking sector consolidation. Of 39 institutions, 32 banks are well on their way to meeting stipulated capital requirements with 8 banks already complying with the 2009 capital requirements. To the extent capital of banks is being enhanced through M&A process it has facilitated a degree of consolidation among conventional banks. SBP has now for few years invoked partial suspension of issuance of new bank licenses. After a period of liberal licensing, SBP is no longer issuing conventional bank licenses in order to encourage sector consolidation. Responding to this, market has been dynamic as evident from the wave of aggressive 25 odd mergers and acquisitions some of them led by strategic foreign banks.  Foreign interest in Pakistani banks is driven by strong business prospects given thus far financial penetration ratio has been considerably low and there exists large potential untapped retail market as well as high profitability with return on equity close to 25%. Foreign banks can either conduct business in branch mode or set up a wholly owned locally incorporated subsidiary provided they are member of a regional group or association or if foreign banks have a global tier-1 paid up capital of US$5 billion or more. Other than these categories a foreign corporate/ body desirous of conducting banking business in Pakistan should set up local subsidiaries with a maximum of 49% share holding. Currently of the 39 banks in the country, almost 14 have foreign shareholding with few of them either fully or partially foreign owned or other smaller strategic stakes. Foreign interest in banking system has been substantial and since 2002 cumulatively has attracted foreign capital inflow of over $2 billion (including funds raised and expected to be raised from GDRs floatation of banks in international markets). Standard Chartered Bank acquisition of mid size Union bank itself has mobilized significant proceeds. Besides, ABN-Amro, Citibank, HSBC, Saudi American Bank and Temasak all have an interest in expanding businesses and/or acquiring domestic stakes, while three banks are offering GDRs in international markets. Foreign interest in Islamic banks is quite strong with four of six banks being foreign owned. Not only is entry easy through M&As in Pakistani banking sector, but license are being issued for Islamic banks as well as microfinance banks – two areas which hold phenomenal prospects for augmenting financial penetration, while serving the development needs particularly for the underserved segments of population. Thus far 6 Islamic banks and 6 microfinance banks have been allowed with former expected to constitute at least 10% of total banking sector by 2010 and 2 BIS Review 26/2007 
microfinance reach to enhance to additional 3 million customers. Evading licensing restrictions, the Government has continued to set up bilateral government-to-government joint venture-DFIs.  Risk management. Banks are allowed to take appropriate and diversified individual, group and sector risk exposures, while nurturing effective governance standards that would ultimately set the stage for a more stable and mature financial market, which can then be allowed greater flexibility. Aside from standard limits on single and group exposures ( limited to 30% and 50% (including 20% and 35% fund based exposure), respectively), banks exposure on contingent liabilities cannot exceed 10 times of its own equity. Likewise, clean lending to single persons is limited to Rs0.5 million and in aggregate it cannot exceed the equity of the banks. Furthermore, Banks/DFIs exposure to a company cannot exceed 10 times of borrowing entities’ equity and the entities current ratio cannot be lower than 1:1. Corporate’s subordinated loans are included in their equity determination. Banks are required to obtain CIB reports for loan transaction above a limit (currently set at Rs500,000) and audited balance sheet from borrowers whose transactions value exceeds Rs10 million.  Since consumer financing is still relatively an emerging area, SBP lays down an elaborate risk management framework for it. Although banks are allowed clean lending for personal and consumer loans within limits (Rs 500,000), these loans cannot be used for real estate purchase or subscription of IPOs. New entrants in the first and second year are not allowed to lend more than 2 and 4 times their bank equity, respectively. For subsequent years, so long as classified loans under consumer finance are 3%, banks can offer up to 10 times their equity and if these classified loans rise up to and above 10% the limits is scaled down to 2 times the equity of bank. Banks are expected to develop effective MIS reporting and risk management system for consumer financing. Subject to adequacy of these system and experience in consumer financing, SBP has relaxed the exposure limits on consumer financing. However, banks not meeting these requirements or illustrating poor track record of consumer financing could face restricted exposure limits. Banks have adapted well to these prudential norms and NPLs related to consumer loans have been low (3% of total NPLs) despite the share of consumer financing in total outstanding advances has risen to about 14%.  These stringent PRs were instituted to ensure prudent risk behavior, however, in cases where justified, central bank can relax these exposure limits for temporary period, if financial strength of company’s balance sheet is expected to improve or there is need to finance a strategic project backed by public sector guarantees. Banks are free to extend loans against hypothecation of stocks and/or receivables and to set margin financing requirements on financing facilities keeping in view risk profile of borrower.  Classification and provisioning for assets conforms to international norms. Loans overdue by 90 days are subject to 25% provision (up from 10%) – effective 31 December 2006 and those overdue by 180 days require 50% provisioning and those above 360 days have to be fully provisioned for.  Corporate governance. A recent World Bank study on South Asia “Access to Finance” ranked Pakistan corporate governance standards highest among South Asia. This is further supplemented by the 2005 ROSC assessment of corporate governance standards which have given higher points, relative to the world average, to Pakistan on majority of its principles.  Among other efforts, this is an outcome of effectiveness of an elaborate Corporate Governance Framework laying down specific corporate governance guidelines for banks which further has infused greater discipline among bank-finance dependent corporate sector. Besides the legislative stipulations of Banking Companies Ordinance (BCO), 1962 that provide rules for fit and proper criteria of Management and Board of Directors (BoD) as well as their appointments/dismissal, disclosure of share ownership, dividend policy, and appointments of external auditors etc., SBP has introduced a Handbook of CG for Banks which, among others, defines the role and responsibilities of BoDs; the fit and proper test criteria prescribed for Chief Executive Officers, Board members and key executives; restriction on shareholdings by the director; dealings of the banks with directors; and requirement of credit rating.  Furthermore SBP, in collaboration with the ICAP (the premier accounting body of the country) and the commercial banks, has facilitated adoption of International Accounting standards (IAS) by the banks. In 2006 (Feb) the reporting formats were revised to incorporate the significant regulatory developments and the modifications in the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). With these changes, the quality of disclosure by banks in their annual accounts is at par with international best practices.  To ensure the quality of external auditors for banks SBP requires an audit firm to be approved from SBP Panel of Auditors. The firm is classified in categories A, B, and C depending on a criterion BIS Review 26/2007 3 
developed internally and the criteria takes into account the number of qualified accountants, international affiliation, quality review by ICAP, and past experience. The classification also prescribe the size of the bank a firm can audit, e.g. large banks can only be audited by firms in category A. Industry-specific PRs. Replacing all prescribed sector ceilings or subsidized lending, SBP encourages competition amongst banks to meet the diverse set of development requirements. Given the gap in supply and demand for credit delivery, SBP has formed consultative groups to identify issues impeding the outreach of financial services for agriculture and rural sector, SME and microfinance sectors. Agriculture sector financing has more than doubled over the last few years, but remains below the overall credit requirements of the sector. Commercialization of agriculture financing, crop loan insurance program and improvements in land registration and passbook system in rural areas have been found to be more effective mechanisms to retail agriculture credit, though flow of non-farm credit has remained low.  Recognizing commercialization of microfinance businesses is key to its financial and social sector sustainability; SBP has set up a regulatory regime for Microfinance banks (MFBs). Currently about 6 MFBs are governed and regulated by the MFIs Ordinance, 2001 that encourages a paradigm shift in microfinance industry, while laying foundation for systematic growth of the sector. MFBs capital requirements are set lower than commercial banks (Rs250 million) and they are required to maintain equity equivalent to at least 15% of its risk-weighted assets. Under PRs, MFBs are required to set 10% of deposit liabilities in liquid assets and transfer 20% of its annual profits after tax into reserve fund until it reaches equivalent to its capital base after which this allocation is reduced to 5%. MFBs have to set up Depositors’ Protection Fund or scheme for the purpose of mitigating risk of its depositors, to which MFB/MFI shall credit not less than 5% of its annual profit after taxes. MFBs have to set aside general provision of 2% besides other stringent provision requirements. MFBs need to lend maximum loan size of Rs150, 000. SBP has further issued NGOs/Rural Support Programs/Cooperative Transformation guidelines for their upgradation to MFBs. Fit and proper criteria have been laid down for CEOs and Management of MFBs. Guidelines have been issued for commercial banks interested in engaging in microfinance business. SBP unique and rich regulatory framework offering a model of development of MF.  Under SBP regulatory framework, banks can offer new financing schemes and innovative products to meet the financial requirements of SMEs, while providing themselves a viable and growing lending outlet. Under PRs, banks are encouraged to extend cash flow based lending and they can take clean exposure secured only against personal guarantees of SMEs owners for up to Rs 3 million, however, clean funded exposure should not exceed Rs 2 million. For eligibility SMEs ought to declare that it has not availed clean facilities from any other bank/DFI. The maximum exposure of a bank / DFI on a single SME shall not exceed Rs 75 million. The total facilities (including leased assets) availed by a single SME from the financial institutions should not exceed Rs 150 million provided that the facilities excluding leased assets shall not exceed Rs 100 million. Operational instructions. Supplementing its PRs, SBP has issued guidelines on risk management, business continuity plan, internal controls, and stress testing. Both PRs and guidelines form the basis of our regulatory framework that enables SBP to carry out a proactive role. As the business is expanding and banks are positioning themselves to take advantage of emerging opportunities, the technology adoption becomes imperative to get a competitive edge to deliver services in an efficient and cost effective manner. Accordingly, almost all the banks in Pakistan have embarked upon major IT projects that will improve their operational efficiency and strengthen internal controls.  Anti-money laundering and Combating Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT). Pakistan like other jurisdictions has adopted a comprehensive set of PRs to enhance its vigilance on money laundering and terrorist financing. PRs for AML require banks to ensure Know-your-customers (KYC) before establishing banking relationships, conduct due diligence on an ongoing basis, identify and provide Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs), ensure maintenance and retention of records, and fulfill specific requirements for compliance officers and wire transfers etc. In July 2006, SBP updated and strengthened these PRs and aligned them further with FATF recommendations. Under KYC-PRs banks have to: ensure true identity of prospective account holders, ascertain nature of the business, obtain introduction of account holder and determination of beneficial ownership of accounts while enhanced due diligence is carried out for high risk customers. At the same time, regulation facilitate interception of transactions, which are, prima facie, associated with money derived from illegal activities by ascertaining customer’s status and source of earnings and investigating transactions that deviate from account history. Banks are required to retain information about each 4 BIS Review 26/2007 
account for a minimum period of five years, of all records of transactions, both domestic and international along with the records on the identification data obtained through KYC/ CDD (NIC, driving license, passport etc.) and record of STR has to be maintained for longer period and can be destroyed only with the prior permission of State Bank.  Banks/ DFIs are prohibited to establish correspondent banking relationship with institutions whose KYC/CDD practices are not in order or who are located in jurisdiction identified by Financial Action Task Force (FATF) as “non-cooperative countries and territories.” Banks/ DFIs have been alerted against misuse of correspondent account by third parties e.g. payable through accounts. Approval for establishing new correspondent relationship has to be taken from senior management. Banks are expected to investigate unusually large transactions and all unusual patterns of transactions to identify any suspicious transaction that is required to be reported to concerned authorities. The information to be reported by banks/ DFIs include title, type of account, numbers of accounts involved, detail of transactions, reasons of suspicion. The employees of banks/ DFIs are strictly prohibited from disclosing the fact to any person that certain transaction has been or is being reported for investigation. SBP has established an AML/CFT unit to deal with the issues of money laundering and CFT. This unit monitors and investigates STRs An AML law is under consideration and its promulgation will strengthen further the legislative and institutional framework for AML. Under the Law, SBP will house a Financial Monitoring Unit (FMU) which will be responsible for overseeing and coordinating all activities related to AML in the financial system. Oversight of AML will further benefit as linkages and information exchange among countries is enhanced.  III. Banking supervision  Like other central banks and supervisory authorities, SBP conducts regular onsite inspections of all financial institutions under its jurisdiction. This involves assessment of banks overall financial health, evaluation of quality of management and role of Boards and sponsors and verification of compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. The inspections are conducted on CAMELS-S methodology whereby inspection team assesses and rates each component viz. Capital Adequacy, Assets Quality, Management, Earning, Liquidity, Sensitivity to Other Risks and Systems and Controls. Increase in size and complexity of financial sector and introduction of new and innovative financial products, has required SBP to enhance the sophistication of approach and methodology of its inspections. Capacity building is being launched to develop SBP skills in risk management, Islamic Banking, treasury, foreign exchange, IT etc. In addition, work is underway to strengthen further its capacities for oversight of Basel 2.  Off-site supervision & surveillance. In response to changing realities, lessons learnt and peculiar financial conditions, the off-site monitoring system at SBP has undergone substantive changes since its introduction in 1997. The off-site monitoring system (i) monitors the overall and individual banks financial health, (ii) helps in early problems detection for appropriate corrective action, and (iii) focuses on-site supervisory resources to high risk areas or activities. Off-site monitoring is conducted based on periodical returns of banks. On line submission of the Report of Chart of Accounts will enhance efficiency and quality of offsite supervision. SBP is to start building capacities for more integrated supervision where industrial groups and NBFIs relationship with banks is growing. At this stage, SBP is coordinating with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (capital market supervisory agency) for exchange of information of transactions that cut across sectors and involve both banks and NBFIs. Institutional Risk Assessment Framework. Driving inspiration mainly from the Supervisory Framework Rating Assessment criteria of the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) of Canada, SBP has introduced an Institutional Risk Assessment Framework (IRAF) to enhance its supervisory vigilance by integrating and consolidating the information collated through its regular supervisory and surveillance mechanisms. IRAF engenders a risk rating taking into consideration the information available regarding a bank from various sources. It not only embraces the offsite and onsite feedback, it also takes management of banks on board, to establish their rating regarding their compliance with standards, codes and guidelines issued by SBP. To make the supervisory process an all-inclusive exercise, market information regarding the health of banks has also been incorporated in the framework.  BIS Review 26/2007 5 
The supervisory process of onsite inspection, offsite surveillance and IRAF culminates into enforcement actions. The enforcement actions that can be taken by SBP range from imposition of pecuniary penalties to removal of management, board of directors and cancellation of banking license. The results of stringent enforcement actions taken have been encouraging as majority of the banks have displayed extraordinary operational performance over the past five years.  IV. Emerging challenges and Issues The increasing growth and complexity in banking sector have now given rise to new issues and challenges. While initially preoccupied with their own primary business of banking, the banks have now cross ownership where industrial and brokerage companies own banks and banks own subsidiaries and associate companies that handle asset management, brokerage, insurance, housing and telecommunications businesses. These close linkages and cross ownership structure among corporate and FIs expose the banks to related party transactions risks. At the same time, growing foreign acquisition and entry of new regional and global players as well as growing domestic banks presence oversees requires SBP to deal with home and host regulator issues. Responding to these structural changes in financial sector, SBP is positioning and equipping its inspection and supervision department to deal more effectively with the emerging supervisory challenges.  Consolidated and cross border supervision. Besides developing in-house capacities for joint conglomeration and consolidated supervision, SBP is developing greater interface with other central banks and has signed about 15 Memorandum of Understandings (MoUs) with various central banks/supervisors. These MoUs have a wide variation in scope, ranging from provisions for exchange of information to sharing license criteria, on-site inspection, supervisory cooperation, combating money laundering, nature of action to be taken in case of any irregularity etc. Even where MoUs are not in existence, SBP shares information with the host country supervisors as and when necessary. However, there is scope for greater effective relationship among regulators.  Complexities of implementing effective risk management. SBP’s elaborate risk management framework has helped contain effectively all sources and types of risks. To monitor resilience of banking system towards shocks to risk factors, SBP calibrates alternate scenarios subject the overall banking system and individual banks to different degrees of credit, market and liquidity shocks. This stress testing is conducted every quarter. Based on September 2006 data, all banks were generally found to be resilient to credit risks and after shock capital adequacy ratio was found to remain above 11%. For one bank, capital adequacy would decline below these levels if either benefit of forced sale value is withdrawn due to banks exposure to mortgage collateral and for couple of banks shocks to credit quality of consumer portfolio may increase consumer sector NPLs and impact capital adequacy. Banks were equally resilient to interest rate shocks for movement upto 200bp and equity price movements in the range of 20%. Liquidity coverage ratio would come down in case of 10% decline in liabilities. In case of exchange rate depreciation banks are found to actually gain as their foreign currency assets are in excess of foreign currency liabilities.  While stress testing results offer broader comfort about banking sector strengths, there is need to recognize that there remain some areas of concerns. For example, banks do face (i) maturity mismatches, of special concern in the rising interest rate scenario; (ii) potential risk of loan defaults in the backdrop of rising consumer finance portfolios and equity markets exposure of the banking system; and (iii) risks posed by weaknesses in internal control system and lack of effective mechanism for containing operational risks. Commercial banks are launching substantive efforts to address these problems and adoption of technological solutions and connectivity of all branches with headquarters of banks will help in this area.  Implementation of Basel II Accord. Pakistan adopted a road map for implementation of Basel II Accord. Under this, banks will be adopting the standardized approach from January 2008 based on the spade work conducted since July 2006. There are number of issues in adoption of standardized approach. First, only a small proportion of corporate sector is rated by the rating agencies. In absence of the rating of borrowers, banks may end up allocating more capital than warranted. To ensure coordinated approach to Basel II implementation, SBP has set up a Working Group under the guidance of SBP to remove obstacles in its smooth implementation. Effective preparation for Basel II requires development of allied and support infrastructure that facilitates need for strengthening and enhancing role of credit rating agencies and development of internal controls and IT systems. In absence of credit rating agencies, Pakistan is developing further role of private sector Credit Information Bureaus, and independent debt/financial advisories etc. The gaps in the rating agencies 6 BIS Review 26/2007 
are of particular concerns for SBP, given its heavy reliance of Standardized approach under Basel II. SBP has to further upgrade its capacity for supervisory review (Pillar II) and a core group of supervisors will be trained in this shortly. Lastly, there is need for more intensive capacity building of industry and SBP. Greater international cooperation in strengthening the capacities of developing markets in risk management and emerging supervisory approaches would be key to enhancing effectiveness of vigilance and oversight both at bank and central bank level.  Conclusion. Being autonomous and effectively empowered under the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 SBP has adopted a rigorous but flexible regulatory framework which helps to keep banks exposure within tolerable range, while allowing them opportunities to enhance and diversify their businesses. Banking sector has played a key role in supporting real sector development whose performance and macroeconomic stability have together re-inforced banking sector performance. All time high profitability and structural transformation of banking sector has attracted substantial foreign capital in banks which given its innovations and practices will augur well for strengthening and sustaining banking sector performance. Proper enforcement of regulatory framework has been helped by a strong SBP’s independent supervisory and surveillance mechanism and validation process of the external auditors. Effective oversight has induced banks to enhance their corporate governance and compliance with laws and regulations that also follow international accounting and disclosure standards. Despite these achievements, both central bank and banks have to continue with broadening and deepening of structural reforms to help enhance financial services penetration and address the outstanding vulnerabilities in the system, while facilitating industry smooth adoption of risk measurement and management systems advocated under Basle II.

Petar Goshev: Promotion of the European Fund for Southeast Europe – EFSE in the Republic of Macedonia  Welcoming speech by Mr Petar Goshev, Governor of the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia, at the first official presentation of the European Fund for Southeast Europe in the Republic of Macedonia, Skopje, 1 March 2007. *      *      * Distinguished ladies and gentlemen! Allow me to express my pleasure, more precisely the pleasure of all employees of the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia for being hosts of the first official presentation of the European Fund for Southeast Europe in the Republic of Macedonia. Therefore, I greet the representatives of the European Fund for Southeast Europe, wishing them a warm welcome to our country, where, I sincerely assure them, they could fully, equally, safely and more ambitiously offer their financial services to the market of the highly open Macedonian economy, also encouraged, of course, from their previous positive experience they acquired through their cooperation with the Export and Credit Bank, AD Skopje.  I would also like to especially welcome all of you that responded to the invitation by attending this presentation, thus de facto showing respect and interest in yet another new financial initiative in the Republic of Macedonia. Certainly, there is a deep reason for such respect and interests. Namely, we are hosts of one of the world's largest development finance funds, established with a capital support of the European Union, the governments of Germany, Switzerland and Austria, as well as many international financial institutions such as the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the German Development Bank (KFW) and the Netherlands Development Finance Company (FMO). This means that we have partners and institutions labeled by the Republic of Macedonia at its list as "vital interest". Their primary objective is, and they will present it better than me though, to finance the development of the Southeast Europe, particularly focusing on the financing needs of micro and small enterprises (MSEs) and private households. Actually we are honored to have the leaders of the European Fund for Southeast Europe to provide details on its structure and objectives, on extending long-term funds and the wide range of financial instruments designed to support the development of the countries throughout our region. I have no doubts that these financial instruments will make you interested and take initiative for forthcoming potential cooperation with the European Fund, and hence with other qualified intermediaries, besides the already established cooperation with the Import and Credit Bank AD Skopje. Dear guests, The fact that the leaders of this Fund offered to present their financial services in the Republic of Macedonia, the Central Bank certainly encouraged and supported this initiative, shows that these important partners consider the Republic of Macedonia a friendly environment for launching various mutually beneficial business initiatives and projects. Yet, we do not forget though, that some of these institutions had no doubts whatsoever about the Republic of Macedonia even in the most difficult periods for us after gaining the independence, since when nobody else was coming, they were here. We certainly appreciate that.  Regardless of all above, we still have many reasons that urge us to notice and convince others why is it good to invest in the Republic of Macedonia and to develop partnership with our economic agents and, of course, to inform on the activities that all of us in our country perform, directed towards increasing the attractiveness of the Republic of Macedonia as investment destination. Hence, we definitely need such financial offers. The economic growth could be accelerated by more investments, competitive offer of financial instruments and products, which are likely to eventually bring about lower costs for borrowing capital. The potential investors should be aware that the Macedonian financial sector is booming, but that the room for investments is yet to be opened. The gross national savings is low, not more than 12-17% of GDP, over the recent several years. The gross domestic savings have been even lower over the last five years, swinging around 2.5% of GDP, on average. Since 1995, the gross investments have virtually never exceeded 20% of GDP. The foreign investments, except in the years of large BIS Review 25/2007 1 
privatizations by foreign companies, are also low, barely 2% of GDP, on average, in the last 4 years. The total bank assets, even though registering a fast growth over the last years, making up roughly 50% of GDP, still shows low level of financial intermediation in the country.  The above figures were target of a deep impact of the external shocks the country suffered, besides, of course, the inexcusable delay of many essential reforms of the vital sectors of the country. But, eventually, the potential investors and creditors have to believe that: - the political and security shocks in the region and inside the country are behind us, - the economy accelerates its growth, which over the recent years is not below 4% real GDP growth, - we preserve high macro-economic stability that implies exceptionally disciplined monetary and fiscal policies, which in turn result in low inflation, stable exchange rate and foreign exchange market, sustainable trade and current account deficits and strictly controlled public debt and that these policies for maintaining macro-economic stability will be further conducted, as a prerequisite for good business, - the price stability policy will be further implemented, - the growth will accelerate registering rates higher than before, - serious structural reforms are underway under the leadership of the government in cooperation with the World Bank and the IMF. The tax policy has undergone reforms by reducing the tax burden. The administration has undergone reforms for increasing its capacity. Additional reforms in the financial sector and improvement of the financial market operations have been underway. There are reforms in the cadastre. The conditions for foreign direct investments have been improving. The process of economy deregulation has been underway. The judiciary reforms have improved the efficiency in the contract execution. The ownership rights have been protected.  The bank soundness and safety have been strengthening. The depositors feel that and repay with over 20% deposit growth over the last several years. And now, we are truly challenged by the further increase in the bank competition, and deeply confident that this process will considerably accelerate very soon. The experience, however, shows that the best come only in well regulated financial sector, in a banking governed by regulations based on the European directives and the world best practices. In this light, the forthcoming new Banking Law allows for further strengthening of the bank corporate governance; minimizing or eliminating all possibilities for non-transparent shareholder structures; increasing the efficiency of the procedure for exclusion from the banking system in the Republic of Macedonia, of shareholders that lack reputation and integrity, thus compromising the stability not only of their bank but across the banking system. Therefore, it allows for establishing proper risk management systems and internal control systems, thus facilitating the gradual migration to risk-based supervision, which is already encompassed in the assignment related to the implementation of the New Capital Accord (so-called BASEL II), over the next several years. All things considered, we could send a message, without any hesitation, to the potential investors and providers of financial services and products that the Republic of Macedonia is a safe place to invest and fructify the capital and that the creation of good, friendly business environment, with competitive advantages compared to others, has been permanently improving.  I wish the European Fund for Southeast Europe a successful business and good cooperation with our financial intermediaries. The room for its policies directed towards micro and small business, household finance, rural sector finance is even wider. Thousands of micro and small enterprises, thousands of families have no access to financial services and products whatsoever, and most of those who do, cannot borrow under the existing borrowing costs and required collaterals. Some has already noticed: "one micro-financing loan could change the future of a family, few could change the future of a local community and thousands of such credits could make an enormous contribution to the development of the overall economy". This Fund will make its contribution to this purpose, since it offers long-term source of financing and because it is aimed at target groups the access of which to the financial injection is most difficult. Let us encourage them by noticing that they have wide opportunities to help them accomplish their mission. And, profit and development for the region. 2 BIS Review 25/2007 
V Leeladhar: Indian financial sector reforms Address by Mr V Leeladhar, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the Annual Washington Conference of the Institute of International Bankers, Washington, DC, 5 March 2007. *      *      * Introduction At the outset, I am thankful to the Institute of International Bankers for giving me this opportunity of addressing the Annual Washington Conference 2007. The banking system in India has undergone significant changes during last 15 years. There have been new banks, new instruments, new windows, new opportunities and, along with all this, new challenges. While deregulation has opened up new vistas for banks to augment revenues, it has also entailed greater competition and consequently greater risks. The traditional face of banks as mere financial intermediaries has since altered and risk management has emerged as the defining attribute. Financial sector reforms introduced in the early 1990s as a part of the structural reforms have touched upon almost all aspects of banking operations. For a few decades preceding the onset of banking and financial sector reforms in India, banks operated in an environment that was heavily regulated and characterised by sufficient barriers to entry, which protected them against too much competition. This regulated environment set in complacency in the manner in which banks operated and responded to the customer needs. The administered interest rate structure, both on the liability and the assets sides, allowed banks to earn reasonable spread without much efforts. Despite this, however, banks’ profitability was low and NPLs level was high, reflecting lack of efficiency. Although banks operated under regulatory constraints in the form of statutory holding of Government securities (statutory liquidity ratio or SLR) and the cash reserve ratio (CRR) and lacked functional autonomy and operational efficiency, the fact was that most banks did not operate efficiently.  While the broad objectives of the financial sector reforms, thus, were to enhance efficiency and productivity, the process of reforms were initiated in a gradual and properly sequenced manner so as to have a reinforcing effect. The approach has been to consistently upgrade the financial sector by adopting the international best practices through a consultative process. Financial sector reforms were carried out in two phases. The first phase of reforms was aimed at creating productive and profitable financial institutions operating within the environment of operational flexibility and functional autonomy. The focus of the second phase of financial sector reforms starting from the second-half of 1990s has been on strengthening of the financial system consistent with the movement towards global integration of financial services. Financial sector reforms in India The deregulation of interest rates constituted an integral part of financial sector reforms. The interest rate regime has been largely deregulated with a view to achieving better price discovery and efficient resource allocation. Banks now have flexibility to decide their deposit and lending rate structures and manage their assets and liabilities accordingly. At present, apart from interest rates on savings deposits and NRI deposits on the deposit side, and export credit and small loans up to Rs. 2 lakh on the lending side, all other interest rates have been deregulated. Indian banking system operated for a long time with high reserve requirements both in the form of Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) and Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR). This was mainly to accommodate the high fiscal deficit and its monetisation. The efforts in the recent period have been to lower both the CRR and SLR. The SLR has been gradually reduced from a peak of 38.5 per cent to 25 per cent. The CRR was reduced from its peak level of 15.0 per cent maintained during 1989 to 1992 to 4.5 per cent of NDTL in June 2003. Although the Reserve Bank continues to pursue its medium-term objective of reducing the CRR, in recent years, on a review of macroeconomic and monetary conditions, the CRR has been revised upwards to 6.0 per cent (to be effective from March 3, 2007).  It has been the endeavour of the Reserve Bank to establish an enabling regulatory framework with prompt and effective supervision, and development of legal, technological and institutional infrastructure. Persistent efforts, therefore, have been made towards adoption of international benchmarks, as appropriate to Indian conditions. In 1994, a Board for Financial Supervision (BFS) BIS Review 25/2007 1 
was constituted comprising select members of the Reserve Bank Board with a variety of professional expertise to exercise 'undivided attention to supervision' and ensure an integrated approach to supervision of commercial banks and financial institutions. The Reserve Bank had instituted a state of-the-art Off-site Monitoring and Surveillance (OSMOS) system for banks in 1995 as part of crisis management framework for Early Warning System (EWS) and as a trigger for on-site inspections of vulnerable institutions. The scope and coverage of off-site surveillance has since been widened to capture various facets of efficiency and risk management of banks. As a part of the financial sector reforms, the regulatory norms with respect to capital adequacy, income recognition, asset classification and provisioning have progressively moved towards convergence with the international best practices. These measures have enhanced transparency of the balance sheet of the banks and infused accountability in their functioning. Besides sub-standard assets, provisioning has also been introduced for the standard assets. Measures to reduce the levels of NPAs concentrated on improved risk management practices and greater recovery efforts facilitated by the enactment of Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest (SARFAESI) Act, 2002. Several other channels of NPA management have also been instituted, including Debt Recovery Tribunals, Lok Adalats (People’s court) and corporate debt restructuring mechanism with separate schemes for small and medium industries. The minimum capital to risk assets ratio (CRAR), which was earlier stipulated at eight per cent was revised to 9 per cent in 1999, which is one percentage point above the international norm. As some banks in the public sector were not able to comply with the CRAR stipulations, there was a need to recapitalise them to augment their capital base. Banks were allowed to raise capital from the market. In line with the amendment to incorporate market risk in Basel I, separate capital charge for market risk was also introduced in 2004.  Accounting standards and disclosure norms were strengthened with a view to improving governance and bringing them in alignment with the international norms. The disclosure requirements broadly covered capital adequacy, asset quality, maturity distribution of select items of assets and liabilities, profitability, country risk exposure, risk exposures in derivatives, segment reporting, and related party disclosures. In April 2005, commercial banks were advised to put in place business continuity measures, including a robust information risk management system within a fixed time frame.  In view of the increasing degree of deregulation and exposure of banks to various types of risks, the Reserve Bank initiated measures for further strengthening and fine-tuning risk management systems in banks. The guidelines on asset-liability management and risk management systems in banks were issued in 1999 and Guidance Notes on Credit Risk Management and Market Risk Management in October 2002 and the Guidance Note on Operational risk management in 2005. In the Reserve Bank, the risk-based approach to supervision has been adopted since 2003 and about 23 banks have been brought under the fold of risk-based supervision (RBS) on a pilot basis. On the basis of the feedback received from the pilot project, the RBS framework is being reviewed. As part of the reform programme, due consideration has been given to diversification of ownership of banking institutions for greater market accountability and improved efficiency. The public sector banks expanded their capital base by accessing the capital market, which diluted the Government ownership. To provide banks with additional options for raising capital funds with a view to enabling smooth transition to the Basel II, the Reserve Bank in January 2006, allowed banks to augment their capital funds by issue of additional instruments. With a view to enhancing efficiency and productivity through competition, guidelines were laid down for establishment of new banks in the private sector and the foreign banks have been allowed more liberal entry. Since 1993, 12 new private sector banks have been set up. As a major step towards enhancing competition in the banking sector, foreign direct investment in the private sector banks is now allowed up to 74 per cent, subject to conformity with the guidelines issued from time to time. The regulatory framework in India, in addition to prescribing prudential guidelines and encouraging market discipline, is increasingly focusing on ensuring good governance through 'fit and proper' owners, directors and senior managers of the banks. Transfer of shareholding of five per cent and above requires acknowledgement from the Reserve Bank and such significant shareholders are required to meet rigorous ‘fit and proper' requirements. Banks have also been asked to ensure that the nominated and elected directors are screened by a nomination committee to satisfy ‘fit and proper' criteria. Directors are also required to sign a covenant indicating their roles and responsibilities. The Reserve Bank has issued detailed guidelines on ownership and governance in private sector banks emphasising diversified ownership.  2 BIS Review 25/2007 
The Reserve Bank released a roadmap for foreign banks articulating a liberalised policy consistent with the WTO commitments in March 2005. The roadmap is divided into two phases. During the first phase, between March 2005 and March 2009, foreign banks wishing to establish presence in India for the first time could either choose to operate through branches or set up 100 per cent wholly owned subsidiaries (WOS), following the one-mode presence criterion. For new and existing foreign banks, it is proposed to go beyond the existing WTO commitment of 12 branches in a year. During this phase, permission for acquisition of shareholding in Indian private sector banks by eligible foreign banks will be limited to banks identified by the Reserve Bank for restructuring. The second phase is scheduled to commence from April 2009 after a review of the experience gained and after due consultation with all the stakeholders in the banking sector. In this phase, three interconnected issues would be taken up. First, rules for the removal of limitations on the operations of the WOS and treating them at par with domestic banks, to the extent appropriate, would be designed and implemented. Second, the WOS of foreign banks, on completion of a minimum prescribed period of operation, may be allowed to list and dilute their stake so that, consistent with the guidelines issued on March 5, 2004, at least 26 per cent of the paid-up capital of the subsidiary is held by resident Indians at all times. Third, during this phase, foreign banks may be permitted to enter into merger and acquisition transactions with any private sector bank in India, subject to the overall investment limit of 74 per cent. In recent years, comprehensive credit information, which provides details pertaining to credit facilities already availed of by a borrower as well as his payment track record, has become critical. Accordingly, a scheme for disclosure of information regarding defaulting borrowers of banks and financial institutions was introduced. In order to facilitate sharing of information related to credit matters, a Credit Information Bureau (India) Limited (CIBIL) was set up in 2000.  The Banking Ombudsman Scheme was notified by the Reserve Bank in 1995 to provide for a system of redressal of grievances against banks. The scheme sought to establish a system of expeditious and inexpensive resolution of customer complaints. The scheme was revised twice, first in 2002 and then in 2006. At present, the scheme is being executed by Banking Ombudsman (BO) appointed by the Reserve Bank at 15 centres covering the entire country. The BO scheme covers all commercial banks and scheduled primary cooperative banks. The scheme was revised recently which brought more grounds of complaints within its ambit. An independent Banking Codes and Standards Board of India was set up on the model of the UK in order to ensure that comprehensive code of conduct for fair treatment of customers is evolved and adhered to. With a view to achieving greater financial inclusion, since November 2005, all banks need to make available a basic banking ‘no frills’ account either with ‘nil’ or very low minimum balances as well as charges that would make such accounts accessible to vast sections of population. Banks were urged to review their existing practices to align them with the objective of ‘financial inclusion’. The smooth functioning of the payment and settlement system is a pre-requisite for financial stability. The Reserve Bank, therefore, has taken several measures from time to time to develop the payment and settlement system in the country along sound lines. The Board for Regulation and Supervision of Payment and Settlement Systems (BPSS), set up in March 2005 as a committee of the Central Board of the Reserve Bank, is the apex body for giving policy direction in the area of payment and settlement systems. Real time gross settlement (RTGS) was operationalised on March 26, 2004. Its usage for transfer of funds, especially for large values and for systemically important purposes, has increased since then. With introduction of RTGS, whereby a final settlement of individual inter-bank fund transfers is effected on a gross real time basis during the processing day, a major source of systemic risk in the financial system has been reduced substantially.  A risk free payments and settlements system in government securities and foreign exchange was established by the Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL), which is set up by banks. CCIL acts as the central counter party (CCP) for all the transactions and guarantees both the securities and funds legs of the transaction. Under the DvPIII mode of settlement that has been adopted, both the securities leg and the fund leg are settled on a net basis. The settlement through CCIL has thus reduced the gross dollar requirement by more than 90 per cent. A screen-based negotiated quote-driven system for dealings in the call/notice and the term money market (NDS-CALL) has been launched by the CCIL in September 18, 2006. The introduction of NDS-CALL helps in enhancing transparency, improving price discovery and strengthening market microstructure. BIS Review 25/2007 3 
Impact of financial sector reforms in India  Banks have been accorded greater discretion in sourcing and utilisation of resources, albeit in an increasingly competitive environment. The outreach of the Indian banking system has increased in terms of expansion of branches/ATMs. In the post-reform period, assets/liabilities of banks have grown consistently at a high rate. The financial performance of banks also improved as reflected in their increased profitability. Net profit to assets ratio improved from 0.49 per cent in 2000-01 to 1.13 per cent in 2003-04. Although it subsequently declined to 0.88 per cent in 2005-06, it was still significantly higher than that in the early 1990s. Banks have been successful in weathering the impact of upturn in interest rate cycle through increasing diversification of their income. Though banks had to incur huge expenditures on upgradation of information technology, the restructuring of the workforce in public sector banks helped them cut down the staff cost and increase in business per employee.  Another welcome development has been the sharp reduction in non-performing loans (NPLs). Both gross and net NPLs started to decline in absolute terms since 2002-03. Gross NPLs as percentage of gross advances, which were above 15 per cent in the early 1990s, are now less than 3 per cent. This distinct improvement in asset quality may be attributed to the improved recovery climate underpinned by strong macroeconomic performance as well as several institutional measures initiated by the Reserve Bank/Government such as debt recovery tribunals, Lok Adalats, scheme of corporate debt restructuring in 2001, the SARFAESI Act in 2002.  Since 1995-96, the banking sector, on the whole, has been consistently maintaining CRAR well above the minimum stipulated norm. The overall CRAR for scheduled commercial banks increased from 8.7 per cent at end-March 1996 to 12.3 per cent at end-March 2006. The number of banks not complying with the minimum CRAR also declined from 13 at end-March 1996 to just two by end-March 2006. Improved capital position stemmed largely from the improvement in profitability and raising of capital from the market, though in the initial stages the Government had to provide funds to recapitalise weak public sector banks.  Even though public sector banks continue to dominate the Indian banking system, accounting for nearly three-fourths of total assets and income, the increasing competition in the banking system has led to a falling share of public sector banks, and increasing share of the new private sector banks, which were set up around mid-1990s. It is clear that we are at the beginning of this new phase in the Indian banking with competitive pressure, both domestic and external, catching up and the need for banks to continuously reassess and reposition themselves in their business plans.  Future challenges for Indian banks A few broad challenges facing the Indian banks are: threats of risks from globalisation; implementation of Basel II; improvement of risk management systems; implementation of new accounting standards; enhancement of transparency and disclosures; enhancement of customer service; and application of technology. Globalisation – a challenge as well as an opportunity The waves of globalisation are sweeping across the world, and have thrown up several opportunities accompanied by concomitant risks. Integration of domestic market with international financial markets has been facilitated by tremendous advancement in information and communications technology. There is a growing realisation that the ability of countries to conduct business across national borders and the ability to cope with the possible downside risks would depend, inter alia, on the soundness of the financial system. This has necessitated convergence of prudential norms with international best practices as well consistent refinement of the technological and institutional framework in the financial sector through a non-disruptive and consultative process.  Opening up of the capital account The Committee on Fuller Capital Account Convertibility (Chairman: Shri S.S. Tarapore) observed that under a full capital account convertibility regime, the banking system would be exposed to greater market volatility, and this necessitated enhancing the risk management capabilities in the banking system in view of liquidity risk, interest rate risk, currency risk, counter-party risk and country risk that arise from international capital flows. The potential dangers associated with the proliferation of derivative instruments – credit derivatives and interest rate derivatives also need to be recognised in 4 BIS Review 25/2007 
the regulatory and supervisory system. The issues relating to cross-border supervision of financial intermediaries in the context of greater capital flows are just emerging and need to be addressed.  Basel II implementation The Reserve Bank and the commercial banks have been preparing to implement Basel II, and it has been decided to allow banks some more time in adhering to new norms. As against the deadline of March 31, 2007 for compliance with Basel II, it was decided in October 2006 that foreign banks operating in India and Indian banks having presence outside India would migrate to the standardised approach for credit risk and the basic indicator approach for operational risk under Basel II with effect from March 31, 2008, while all other scheduled commercial banks are required to migrate to Basel II by March 31, 2009.  It is widely acknowledged that implementation of Basel II poses significant challenge to both banks and the regulators. Basel II implementation may also be seen as a compliance challenge. But at the same time, it offers two major opportunities to banks, viz., refinement of risk management systems; and improvement in capital efficiency. The transition from Basel I to Basel II essentially involves a move from capital adequacy to capital efficiency. This transition in how capital is used and how much capital is needed will become a significant factor in return-on-equity strategy for years to come. The reliance on the market to assess the riskiness of banks would lead to increased focus on transparency and market disclosure, critical information describing the risk profile, capital structure and capital adequacy. Besides making banks more accountable and responsive to better-informed investors, these processes enable banks to strike the right balance between risks and rewards and to improve the access to markets. Improvements in market discipline also call for greater coordination between banks and regulators.  Improving risk management systems  Basel II has brought into focus the need for a more comprehensive risk management framework to deal with various risks, including credit and market risk and their inter-linkages. Banks in India are also moving from the individual silo system to an enterprise-wide risk management system. While the first milestone would be risk integration across the entity, the next step would entail risk aggregation across the group both in the specific risk areas as also across the risks. Banks would, therefore, be required to allocate significant resources towards this endeavour. In India, the risk-based approach to supervision is also serving as a catalyst to banks’ migration to the integrated risk management systems. However, taking into account the diversity in the Indian banking system, stabilizing the RBS as an effective supervisory mechanism is another challenge. Corporate governance To a large extent, many risk management failures reflect a breakdown in corporate governance which arise due to poor management of conflict of interest, inadequate understanding of key banking risks, and poor Board oversight of the mechanisms for risk management and internal audit. Corporate governance is, therefore, the foundation for effective risk managements in banks and, thus, the foundation for a sound financial system. Therefore, the choices which banks make when they establish their risk management and corporate governance systems have important ramifications for financial stability. Banks may have to cultivate a good governance culture building in appropriate checks and balances in their operations. There are four important forms of oversight that should be included in the organisational structure of any bank in order to ensure appropriate checks and balances: (i) oversight by the board of directors or supervisory board; (ii) oversight by individuals not involved in the day-to-day running of the various business areas; (iii) direct line supervision of different business areas; and (iv) independent risk management, compliance and audit functions. In addition, it is important that key personnel are fit and proper for their jobs. Furthermore, the general principles of sound corporate governance should also be applied to all banks, irrespective of their unique ownership structures.  Implementation of new accounting standards  Derivative activity in banks has been increasing at a brisk pace. While the risk management framework for derivative trading, which is a relatively new area for Indian banks (particularly in the BIS Review 25/2007 5 
more structured products) is an essential pre-requisite, the absence of clear accounting guidelines in this area is a matter of significant concern. The World Bank’s ROSC on Accounting and Auditing in India has commented on the absence of an accounting standard which deals with recognition, measurement and disclosures pertaining to financial instruments. The Accounting Standards Board of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) is considering issue of Accounting Standards in respect of financial instruments. These will be the Indian parallel to International Accounting Standards 32 and 39. The proposed Accounting Standards will be of considerable significance for financial entities and could, therefore, have implications for the financial sector. The formal introduction of these Accounting Standards by the ICAI is likely to take some time in view of the processes involved. In the meanwhile, the Reserve Bank is considering the need for banks and financial entities adopting the broad underlying principles of IAS 39. Since this is likely to give rise to some regulatory/prudential issues, all relevant aspects are being comprehensively examined. The proposals in this regard would, as is normal, be discussed with the market participants before introduction. Adoption and implementation of these principles are likely to pose a great challenge to both the banks and the Reserve Bank.  Supervision of financial conglomerates The financial landscape is increasingly witnessing entry of some of the bigger banks into other financial segments like merchant banking, insurance etc. Emergence of several new players with diversified presence across major segments make it imperative for supervision to be spread across various segments of the financial sector. In this direction, an inter-regulatory Working Group was constituted with members from RBI, SEBI and IRDA. The framework proposed by the Group is complementary to the existing regulatory structure wherein the individual entities are regulated by the respective regulators and the identified financial conglomerates are subjected to focussed regulatory oversight through a mechanism of inter-regulatory exchange of information. As a first step in this direction, an inter-agency Working Group on Financial Conglomerates (FC) comprising the above three supervisory bodies identified 23 FCs and a pilot process for obtaining information from these conglomerates has been initiated. The complexities involved in the supervision of financial conglomerates are a challenge not only to the Reserve Bank of India but also to the other regulatory agencies, which need to have a close and continued coordination on an on-going basis.  In view of increased focus on empowering supervisors to undertake consolidated supervision of bank groups and since the Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision have underscored consolidated supervision as an independent principle, the Reserve Bank had introduced, as an initial step, consolidated accounting and other quantitative methods to facilitate consolidated supervision. The components of consolidated supervision include, consolidated financial statements intended for public disclosure, consolidated prudential reports intended for supervisory assessment of risks and application of certain prudential regulations on group basis. In due course, consolidated supervision as introduced above would evolve to cover banks in mixed conglomerates, where the parent may be non-financial entities or parents may be financial entities coming under the jurisdiction of other regulators.  Application of advanced technology The role of technology in banking in creating new business models and processes, in maintaining competitive advantage, in enhancing quality of risk management systems in banks, and in revolutionising distribution channels, cannot be overemphasised. Recognising the benefits of modernising their technology infrastructure, banks are taking the right initiatives. While doing so, banks have four options to choose from: they can build a new system themselves, or buy best of the modules, or buy a comprehensive solution, or outsource. A further challenge which banks face in this regard is to ensure that they derive maximum advantage from their investments in technology and avoid wasteful expenditure which might arise on account of uncoordinated and piecemeal adoption of technology; adoption of inappropriate/ inconsistent technology and adoption of obsolete technology. A case in point is the implementation of core banking solution by some banks without assessing its scalability or adaptability to meet Basel II requirements.  Financial inclusion While banks are focusing on the methodologies of meeting the increasing demands placed on them, there are legitimate concerns with regard to the banking practices that tend to exclude rather than 6 BIS Review 25/2007 
attract vast sections of population, in particular pensioners, self-employed and those employed in unorganised sector. While commercial considerations are no doubt important, banks have been bestowed with several privileges, especially of seeking public deposits on a highly leveraged basis, and consequently they should be obliged to provide banking services to all segments of the population, on equitable basis. Further, experience has shown that consumers’ interests are at times not accorded full protection and their grievances are not properly attended to. Feedback received reveals recent trends of levying unreasonably high service/user charges and enhancement of user charges without proper and prior intimation. It is in this context that the Governor, Reserve Bank of India had mentioned in the Annual Policy Statement 2005-06 that RBI will take initiatives to encourage greater degree of financial inclusion in the country; setting up of a mechanism for ensuring fair treatment of consumers; and effective redressal of customer grievances.  Conclusion With the increasing levels of globalisation of the Indian banking industry, evolution of universal banks and bundling of financial services, competition in the banking industry will intensify further. The banking industry has the potential and the ability to rise to the occasion as demonstrated by the rapid pace of automation which has already had a profound impact on raising the standard of banking services. The financial strength of individual banks, which are major participants in the financial system, is the first line of defence against financial risks. Strong capital positions and balance sheets place banks in a better position to deal with and absorb the economic shocks. BIS Review 25/2007 7 
Y V Reddy: Regulators’ eyes on financial institutions Comments by Dr Y V Reddy, Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, published in January 2007 issue of The Banker, London. It can also be accessed at www.thebanker.com. *      *      * As we move from a world based on relationships to one based on transactions, can our banks be far behind? Indeed, banking has been transformed, perhaps unrecognisably, and regulators and customers are taking notice. In the 1970s, a visit to the bank meant face-to-face time, assistance with problems, financial advice, and often just a friendly chat with your banker who you knew and trusted. Today, many customers and banks prefer point-and-click transactions, and face time can sometimes mean fees. And whether you are in Chennai or Chicago, the person answering your bank query is probably in Bangalore. What does this mean for the banks, their customers and regulators? Banks rely less on customer loyalty and more on efficiency. Reputational concerns that were once paramount are less critical – witness the million-dollar penalties routinely imposed on some of the global banking giants; yet, they continue to grow. Efficiency rules Fee-based income has overtaken net interest margin income. Customers enjoy efficient transactions, but find themselves unequipped to make the best possible financial decisions with regard to their banking needs. It is perhaps significant that bank regulators, who were until recently content with bank licensing and applying prudential regulations while encouraging competition, are now focusing on preparing customers to deal with the banks. Today, some banks levy a penalty or an interest charge for not maintaining a minimum balance, for not operating a bank account for a certain period, and for other negligent behaviour – although the interest charges paid by the bank for similar negligent behaviour are less than those paid by the depositor. These treatments are often sanctified by the terms and conditions imposed when an account holder opens an account. But in signing the contract, customers are not as empowered or as cautious as they should be. This could be due to several reasons, among them the prevalence of non-standard contracts that make comparison of competing products difficult and tend to dampen competition. Educating consumers In response to overcharging on credit cards and other issues, bank regulators are taking initiatives to prepare customers for the market by educating them (through financial education initiatives), counselling them (through credit counselling), and assuring them (of "fair trade practices" and "reasonable charges"). Regulators seem to be aware of the need to consciously connect the common person with bank services and equip him to manage the new reality of transaction-based but multi-faceted banking. Regulators all over the world have recognised some market failures in savings and credit markets and that banks’ sophisticated customer-segmentation strategy has unintended consequences. Thus, globally, financial inclusion is now a priority. Initiatives range from the Financial Inclusion Task Force in the UK, which has noted that better customer-segmentation technology has led to certain sections of the population being financially excluded, to the Community Reinvestment Act in the US, which imposes an affirmative and continuing obligation on banks to serve the credit and banking needs of all the communities in which they are chartered, to the initiatives of the Indian government and the Reserve Bank.  Regulatory sea change Banks are special. They have special privileges and unique obligations. They are licensed to take uncollateralised deposits from the public but have a high degree of leverage.

necessary. However, recent developments indicate a rebalancing of the focus of regulators and the awareness of bank customers. The regulators’ thrust, of late, on financial inclusion, financial education, credit counselling, fair trade practices, reasonable charges and avoidance of unequal contracts is the right way forward to ensure an efficient, inclusive and equitable banking system. 2 BIS Review 24/2007 
Ajith Nivard Cabraal: Importance of corporate governance for the banking and financial sector Keynote address by Mr Ajith Nivard Cabraal, Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, at the 9th South Asia Management Forum, Dhaka, 24–25 February 2007. *      *      * What is governance and why have governance? Governance may be said to be all about effective, transparent and accountable administration of affairs of an institution by its management, while protecting the interests of its stakeholders including shareholders, creditors, regulators and the public. Modern Corporate Governance practices have evolved over time and different codes of best practice on Corporate Governance have been developed by various organisations. E.g. the OECD code of Corporate Governance, the Basel code of Corporate Governance for banks and financial institutions, etc. At the same time, several fundamental Corporate Governance Principles have now evolved and have received worldwide acceptance, and guidelines under each such principle have been comprehensively developed by Corporate Governance activists, practitioners, researchers, and others. These principles generally relate to the responsibilities of the Board, Directors, Chairmen, CEOs, senior management, Board appointed committees, auditors, shareholders and regulators. Accountability, internal controls, related party transactions, conflicts of interest, information disclosures have also been extensively dealt with and targeted in the formulation of these principles. Corporate Governance principles had its origins in the 19th century although the term Corporate Governance itself came into vogue in the latter part of the 1980s. The need to focus on good practices of Corporate Governance mainly arose as a response to the separation of ownership and control following the formation of joint stock companies. The owners or shareholders of these joint stock companies, who were not involved in day to day operational issues, required assurances that those in control of the company, the directors and managers, were safeguarding their investments and accurately reporting the financial outcome of their business activities. Thus, directors were the original targets of Corporate Governance, and practices and principles were designed to protect the interests of the shareholders from misdemeanours of directors. However, current thinking recognizes a company’s obligations to society more generally in the form of all stakeholders, and it has been this new thinking that has driven the study and practice of good Corporate Governance to the levels it has reached today. Perhaps it is also such thinking that accounts for the hectic pace at which developments have taken place and are taking place in the practice as well. Since the latter part of 2001, the very lively and often controversial debate on Corporate Governance became an even more turbulent debate as a result of the massive corporate scandals and failures that rocked the business world, namely Enron and WorldCom. Almost as a knee-jerk reaction, new laws, e.g. the Sarbanes – Oxley Act in the USA and similar laws and/or regulations all over the world were quickly introduced in a possible attempt to prevent such scandals and failures in future, and to soothe the nervous minds of investors, both local and international. But, while the “big stick” was being brandished and freely wielded, the modern thinking and realization that has been quickly but firmly evolving simultaneously has been that, achieving an outcome of good corporate behavior needs more than just a long list of rules, regulations, and big sticks.  In fact, we all have now begun to learn and understand that corporate scandals and failures are a bit like the flu. Regulators, researchers and stakeholders regularly “discover” or “invent” new vaccines to combat the menace, but the virus mutates and surfaces again in a different form or under a different strain. In the same way, notwithstanding many initiatives of the 1990s and the early 2000s, after several rounds of corporate scandals around the globe, from Enron to WorldCom to Parmalat to Daewoo to so many others, new vaccines and treatment methods had to be quickly researched, hastily prescribed, and widely administered. After the dust has settled however, we now find, when we pensively reflect, that some treatment may have been too strong or has been causing too many adverse side-effects. Some pills may have been too bitter. Some tablets may have been too expensive. Some disease management techniques may even have been more harmful than the disease! Nevertheless, in our collective endeavour to pump the patient with as many drugs and tests BIS Review 24/2007 1 
we could possibly administer (may be because we could avoid law suits relating to professional negligence by doing so!), a plethora of new rules and regulations have been churned out and these keep being churned out at regular intervals. But, with all that frenzied activity, the vexed question that keeps on haunting stakeholders is: Will today’s regulations suffice to inoculate companies from crises in the future and keep them healthy? Will these rules help to maintain and sustain investors’ trust in companies? Will these laws and regulations help to stimulate institutions instead of stifling them? Will these efforts actually build trust and confidence in the overall system? Of course, we have to readily admit that if not for the quick responses in the aftermath of Enron and others, the damage could have been too much to bear. The repercussions and loss of confidence could have been too serious to contemplate. But, at the same time, a painful truth has also emerged. i.e., that laws, rules, regulations and Codes, by themselves do not ensure good corporate behavior. However powerful and strong the new vaccines appear to be, however effective the treatment seems to be, however professional and keen the doctor tries to be, new diseases will emerge. Some may be minor. But, ever so often, new strains will occur, that will place the system under severe threat.  Arising from this realization, another fundamental realization has also dawned. i.e., good corporate behavior is ensured when companies and stakeholders genuinely believe that it is in their own best interests to act ethically and to act according to best governance practices. Enforcement is important. But we have to admit that enforcement by itself will not keep bad actors out of the theatre. We will sometimes observe that some actors are bad, only after they have performed for some time. In the same way, there cannot be a set of laws or regulations that are complete in every way so as to be able to deal with every risk prevalent in the market. Many are the instances where market participants, especially those driven by short term self interest, look for regulatory loopholes and lacuna to further their interest without being unduly bothered by the underlying prudence of their actions. Therefore, regulators have begun to acknowledge that they alone cannot guarantee that all companies will continue to advance in a safe and sound manner. Regulators have also, albeit painfully, realized that all competing parties cannot be simultaneously fully satisfied. Unfortunately however, it is in this turbulent, and sometimes even chaotic environment that we have to search for solutions.  Corporate Governance is also increasingly acknowledged as being an important instrument to address “ownership issues” as well. With the current practices that are available worldwide which can hide the identities of true owners, it is now almost impossible for regulators to only rely on ownership limits to deal with undue influence, or be assured that seemingly unrelated parties are not actually related! Consequently, markets are increasingly looking towards the application of good Corporate Governance practice to overcome any ill-effects that may arise out of ownership concentration and it is generally believed that if good governance is in place, concentrated ownership, known or unknown, may not adversely affect the risk management process of the institution. In the case of banks especially, regulatory limits on ownership in banks are prescribed in a number of countries to prevent banks from being controlled by a single owner or a group of connected owners. However, a majority of countries in the world still do not have such regulations. In fact, according to a World Bank survey of 157 countries in 2003, 112 did not have regulations on ownership limits. Nevertheless, in many countries, indirect regulations such as limits on related-party transactions and fit and proper tests for bank directors and executive officers are in place to promote this aspect of good Corporate Governance, and I think, regulators genuinely believe that such practices would increasingly ensure the better risk management of banks, thereby leading to a more sound system. All in all, as of today, Codes of Best Practice on Corporate Governance set out principles within which values and governance rules should be set by the management of the institution, and in the final analysis, good Corporate Governance is looked to as being a key tool to be used in the overall risk management of institutions, irrespective of the nature of the business carried out by the institution. Why is good governance in the banking and financial system more important than any other sector? The Banking and financial sector is easily distinguishable from the others. A few distinguishing features stand out: • Unlike normal business entities which are funded mainly through shareholders’ funds, banks’ business involves funds raised mainly through deposits. The business of raising public deposits places greater fiduciary responsibilities on the institution and its managers, since depositors’ funds need to be safeguarded in a special way. 2 BIS Review 24/2007 
• Banks perform as financial intermediaries by lending and investing the funds mobilized and funding economic activities of others. • Banks are the agents of the payments system where they facilitate payments domestically and internationally, through various instruments such as bank accounts, fund transfers, credit cards, etc. • Banks are able to undertake all such business operations as a result of public trust and faith in the stability and soundness of the banks in particular and the system in general. The history on bank failures in many countries indicates that loss of public confidence in banks could be contagious and could easily lead to systemic banking crisis situations. Overall, the banking business is the key for monetary conditions in a country. Bank deposit and lending business determines the supply, cost and availability of money. Money is created by the banking system through the legal tender issued by the Central Banks and/or Monetary Authorities. Since sight money created is payable by banks at any time through legal tender and technically, the banking system does not have funds adequate for meeting all such created money at any particular point of time. Banking business thus casts a huge responsibility on the monetary authorities to facilitate, regulate, and protect the banking and payments system. Weak Corporate Governance (CG) can contribute to financial instability and that would increase the risk profile of companies in the corporate sector and expose the banks and financial institutions to a greater risk. In a more direct sense, weaknesses in CG arrangements in banks and financial institutions reduce their capacity to identify, monitor and manage their business risk and that can result in poor quality lending and excessive risk-taking by the financial institutions. Depending on the resilience of the financial institutions and markets, these risks have the potential to spread across the wider financial system. Needless to say that inadequate CG can also lead to a poor credit culture, excessive exposure concentration, poor management of interest risk/exchange risk and inadequacies in the management of connected exposures. Some of these risks, singularly or collectively, can lead to potential insolvency and financial instability. In more recent times, the regulators world over have introduced prudential norms on single borrower exposures, group exposures and concentration of credit risks. The underlying principles of such norms indicate some degree of compulsion on the observance of CG principles. To further augment such prudential norms, regulators may even consider introducing mandatory disclosures by banks and financial institutions. Where does good governance fit in this scenario? Obviously, Corporate Governance is now identified and acknowledged as a powerful tool to generate trust and confidence in an institution. In that context, good Corporate Governance is essentially important for banks, because such institutions (a) deal with funds raised from the public; (b) are likely to encounter greater risks including frauds and failure; and (c) if such frauds or failures occur in such institutions, it may pose issues relating to public confidence in the financial system stability itself.  All these reasons have led to Banks tending to depend upon risk management practices based on principles of prudence rather than complying with only minimum requirements.  It is also as a result of such realization that many stakeholders and regulators are now consciously looking towards good Corporate Governance, as one of the prime instruments in its overall effort to maintain financial system stability. In Sri Lanka, the CBSL has already issued a voluntary code of best practice on Corporate Governance to banks. This was prepared by a Task Force consisting of persons from the banking and financial sector. But, we now believe that the time has come for us to move towards more stringent application of Corporate Governance Codes and therefore we are now in the process of drafting and issuing a new code of best practices on Corporate Governance to be made mandatory for banks.  What are the challenges that face regulators in dealing with the Banks? Over the past few decades, the activities in the field of banking have been increasing rapidly and today a large number of new areas have been added to the traditional list of services provided by Banks. An examination of such lists would clearly indicate that Banks of today are performing many BIS Review 24/2007 3 
services that were hitherto provided by other service providers. We now see that the conventional difference between banking and other financial businesses, i.e., insurance and securities trading, has almost disappeared. In the meantime, the rapid development of debt securities markets too, has been posing new challenges to the traditional intermediation business of banks. All this has blurred the customary boundaries and there are many overlaps that have been created. Naturally these trends lead to new challenges to the Regulators of banks who now have to deal with these new multi-faceted conglomerates, instead of the traditional deposit taking/money lending institutions that were once-upon-a-time called “bank”. Therefore, today, a need has surfaced where several regulators are compelled to act as a group to undertake consolidated supervision of the financial institutions, especially financial conglomerates, and this is becoming increasingly common. Regulators now tend to enter into MOUs to share information under the current legal provisions, and they also have periodical meetings, sometimes in the form of financial system stability committees or as inter-regulatory institutions committees to assess potential systemic risks/crises and to develop crisis prevention and resolution measures. In fact, in some countries, Regulators now develop common tools to conduct financial “fire drills” to prepare for possible failures of large financial institutions, and such practices include various simulation techniques as well.  That is not all. The Regulators’ work has become even more complex due to the rapid internationalization of the banking system. Internationalization could take place in two ways: through ownership or business operations. “Ownership” involves international investors and/or international banks acquiring banks in other countries. Banking “business operations” gets internationalized through the use of modern IT where geographical boundaries and country regulatory boundaries are no longer applicable and it becomes increasingly difficult to identify a single particular location as being the operative area in respect of certain financial transactions. Modern IT and financial liberalization are the keys that have led to this type of banking internationalization. At the same time, it has provided for innovative electronic money and scripless settlements systems for cross-border financial transactions. Financial liberalization is now leading to banking internationalization where surplus funds flow cross-border to finance deficit units, i.e., international intermediation. In this background, it is now realized by Regulations that the high mobility of capital flows creates enormous risks to internationalized banks and to international systems, if the individual fund management systems of such banks are not sound. This requires Regulators to place even greater weight upon the efficacy of the governance systems since the failure of such institutions could be catastrophic to the well being of the entire global financial systems. In addition, the ill effects of money laundering, financing of illegal activities, and the financing of terrorism through the banking system are further risks that are faced by banks due to this growing internationalization. These too, need to be addressed by stakeholders who are involved in the development of the evolving systems. To deal with these challenges, Regulators now have to close ranks internationally as well, and attempt to harmonize prudential requirements to monitor risks of international financial conglomerates, and in this regard, we all must be somewhat relieved that the Basel capital accord has provided a clear framework for us to apply on the subject. As we all know, the Basel code of Corporate Governance for banks and financial institutions covers 8 principles. These are: • Principle 1: Board members should be qualified for their positions, have a clear understanding of their role in Corporate Governance and be able to exercise sound judgment about the affairs of the bank. • Principle 2: The board of directors should approve and oversee the bank’s strategic objectives and corporate values that are communicated throughout the banking organization. • Principle 3: The board of directors should set and enforce clear lines of responsibility and accountability through the organization. • Principle 4: The board should ensure that there is appropriate oversight by senior management consistent with board policy. • Principle 5: The board and senior management should effectively utilize the work conducted by the internal audit function, external auditors, and internal control functions. • Principle 6: The board should ensure that compensation policies and practices are consistent with the bank’s corporate culture, long-term objectives and strategy, and control environment.  • Principle 7: The bank should be governed in a transparent manner. 4 BIS Review 24/2007 
• Principle 8: The board and senior management should understand the bank’s operational structure, including where the bank operates in jurisdictions, those that may impede transparency (i.e. “know-your-structure”). It is very clear today, more than ever, that Regulators also have a key role to play in achieving good Corporate Governance. In general, all regulations, in the Banking System, are intended in one way or another, to enforce prudential requirements on key areas of affairs of institutions to mitigate identified risks. Regulations on ownership, related party transactions, fitness and propriety tests for directors are directly based on modern Corporate Governance principles. However, the Basel Committee goes further and describes the role of supervisors in Corporate Governance by adding new parameters as well. These are: • Supervisors should provide guidance to banks on sound Corporate Governance and the pro-active practices that should be in place. • Supervisors should consider Corporate Governance as one element of depositor protection. • Supervisors should determine whether the bank has adopted and effectively implemented sound Corporate Governance policies and practices. • Supervisors should assess the quality of banks’ audit and control functions. • Supervisors should evaluate the effects of the bank’s group structure. • Supervisors should bring to the board of directors’ and management’s attention, problems that they detect through their supervisory efforts. According to Basel recommendations, Corporate Governance should be promoted by other stakeholders as well. For instance, • Shareholders – through the active and informed exercise of shareholder rights; • Depositors and other customers – by not conducting business with banks that are operated in an unsound manner; • Auditors – through a well-established and qualified audit profession, audit standards and communications to boards of directors, senior management and supervisors; • Banking industry associations – through initiatives related to voluntary industry principles and agreement on and publication of sound practices; • Professional risk advisory firms and consultancies – through assisting banks in implementing sound Corporate Governance practices; • Governments – through laws, regulations, enforcement and an effective judicial framework;  • Credit rating agencies – through review and assessment of the impact of Corporate Governance practices on a bank’s risk profile; • Securities regulators, stock exchanges and other self-regulatory organizations – through disclosure and listing requirements; and  • Employees – through communication of concerns regarding illegal or unethical practices or other Corporate Governance weaknesses. In a broader sense, mandating the banks and financial institutions to adhere to full disclosures of their operations would not only allow the markets, investors, depositors and others to keep a close watch on the financial institutions, but also provide an opportunity for other regulators also to be closely involved in supervising these institutions. For example, listed banks and financial institutions are not only under the supervisory arm of the Central Banks, but also the Securities & Exchange Commissions. In multi-regulatory and multi-supervisory systems like what is still prevalent in our part of the world, it is necessary to ensure that the regulatory and supervisory burden be shared by all who are responsible for regulating and supervising banking and financial institutions. This will also provide an opportunity to mitigate concentration of regulatory risks. In multi-regulatory regimes, it is particularly relevant to ensure that appropriate CG principles are laid down, so that all regulators are aware of the principles behind these governance rules that are introduced in the interest of the wider financial system stability. BIS Review 24/2007 5 
In promoting sound CG, it is also necessary to develop an effective legal framework that specifies the rights and obligations of the institution, be it a bank or a finance company or other, its directors, shareholders and other stakeholders. The regulators, on their part, should initiate action to build capacity in CG at various levels, including the chairmen, the boards of directors and senior management of banks and financial institutions. The legal framework should also provide for disclosure requirements, facilitating the enforcement of the law. Further, it is essential to encourage an effective financial news media, which deals with the importance of CG and educate the public. They should play a more responsible role in disseminating accurate information to the public and initiating a meaningful discussion on the subject. Conclusion The developments in Corporate Governance that are taking place all over the world are increasingly complex. It is almost impossible for those who are not undertaking full-time studies on the subject to keep pace with these developments. Yet, all of us who are interested in systems that stimulate business and keep the wheels of economies moving at a rapid space, would continue to have a strong interest in the subject. I am also hopeful that, the banking and financial community will continue to promote and foster these studies and practices since these provide the lubrication for the smooth functioning of our complicated financial systems in our ever-changing corporate regimes.  We also know that a large portion of global business is in the banking sector. In addition, all business entities, maintain direct relationships with banks and financial institutions. In that context, the pre-eminent position that is applicable to the banks and enjoyed by them cannot be over-emphasized or under-estimated. Therefore, our efforts to enhance the governance capabilities and capacities within banks and financial institutions have to be at the forefront of our agendas. The trend in the world of targeting governance practices in the banking and financial sector to be at the cutting edge of prevailing practices worldwide is a significant step in the right direction and should continue to be so in the future as well.  Let us therefore together and collectively dedicate ourselves to promote and apply good Corporate Governance principles and practices in our respective banking and financial sectors. Needless to say, the beneficiaries of such efforts will be our own economies which we are striving to develop as quickly as possible. 6 BIS Review 24/2007 
T T Mboweni: The commodity price boom and the South African economy Address by Mr T T Mboweni, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, at the Regional Business Achievers Awards Dinner of the Businesswomen’s Association, Pretoria, 27 June 2007.  *      *      * Honoured guests Ladies and gentlemen 1.  Introduction Thank you for your invitation to speak at this business achievers awards ceremony. For too long the world of business has been a domain for men only, but in recent years more and more women have been making their mark in this arena. The Businesswomen’s Association has been instrumental in promoting and encouraging women who have entered the business world. The important role that women played in the liberation of our country is without question. Women have also played an important role in various fields which have contributed to the overall development of the country. It is now time for women to be at forefront of the business sector. Women in business are a scarce resource and your efforts deserve support. The economic environment in South Africa has been extremely positive in recent times, with growth averaging around five per cent for the past three years. An important contributing factor to this favourable environment has been the behaviour of commodity prices. As a commodity producer, we should be pleased when commodity prices are performing well. However, as we know from past experience, commodity price booms can be a mixed blessing. Too often in our history we have ignored the fact that commodity prices move in cycles. There had been a tendency to regard price booms as being permanent, only for things to end in tears when the cycle ended. The current boom has persisted for longer than many had predicted, leading to suggestions that we are now in a commodity super-cycle. At the same time, commodities have become a new asset class on their own. In my comments this evening I will highlight some of the recent developments in commodity prices and some of the challenges posed for the economy in general and monetary policy in particular. 2.  Commodities and the South African economy As you are aware, commodities have played a central role in South Africa’s economic development. The mining industry, largely supported by gold, diamonds, coal and the platinum group of metals, has for more than a century contributed significantly to the national economy. It has provided the impetus for the development of physical infrastructure, as well as the establishment of the country’s secondary industries.  South Africa is a leading supplier of a range of minerals and mineral products. According to the Chamber of Mines, in 2005, approximately 55 different minerals were produced from 1 113 mines and quarries, of which 45 mines produced gold, 29 produced platinum-group minerals, 64 produced coal and 202 produced diamonds. Mining, therefore, remains a key foundation of the South African economy. In 2005 mining made a direct and indirect contribution of approximately 15 per cent to GDP, accounted for around 50 per cent of merchandise exports (including primary and beneficiated mineral exports), 12 per cent of fixed investment, 30 per cent of the market value of the JSE limited and 20 per cent of formal-sector employment.  However, it is important to note that an abundance of resources has not always implied a prosperous economy. This is particularly true for many resource-rich African countries, which until recently have not benefited from their resource endowments. Natural resources are also not a prerequisite for growth. Countries such as Japan and Switzerland with few natural resources have at times outperformed countries with a wealth of resource endowments. In fact, having natural resources is sometimes regarded as a curse. As far back as the 1950s, Prebisch and Singer postulated the secular decline of terms of trade of commodity-producing countries. The essence of their argument was that commodity prices had a tendency to decline over the long term. This, until recently, has been largely borne out by empirical evidence.  BIS Review 73/2007 1 
In the last 140 years there have been 18 commodity cycles, with slumps being more persistent than booms. In some instances in sub-Saharan Africa, commodity price slumps have lasted over 30 years. However, since 2001, as commodity prices have boomed, we have witnessed impressive economic growth in many of the resource-rich African countries. Notwithstanding the structural shift from a commodity-based country to a more services-oriented one, South Africa has also experienced a concomitant increase in growth over this period. 3.  Commodity price movements over the last five years During 2001, the overall commodity index as measured by the International Monetary Fund began to increase steadily. This increase has continued well into 2007, particularly in the case of energy and metals. Not only have the increases been more persistent, giving rise to the super-cycle hypothesis, but the surge has been larger than in previous cycles. Increases have also differed significantly across commodities. For example the price of North Sea Brent crude oil increased from around $19 per barrel in 2002 to around $72 per barrel in June 2007, having peaked at almost US$80 per barrel in August last year. Metals have also shown a strong increase with gold and platinum prices having increased by approximately 120 per cent over the same period.  Agricultural prices, by contrast, have displayed more volatility and less growth when compared to energy and metals. Between 2001 and 2006, the IMF commodity food price index increased by 36 per cent. More narrowly, and perhaps more relevant to South Africa, the cereals price index increased by 48 per cent over the same period. In 2006 alone, the IMF maize and wheat price indices increased by 24 per cent and 26 per cent respectively. Food price inflation is becoming a world-wide concern and South Africa has not been spared. Spot prices of yellow and white maize have increased from levels of around R500 per ton in 2004 to current levels of around R1 800 per ton driven in part by international price developments. In October and November last year, meat prices increased at year-on-year rates of almost 20 per cent, and currently overall food inflation is in excess of 8 per cent per annum. 4.  What has driven the recent price increases? It used to be the case that the growth cycle in the United States determined the commodity cycle. More recently, with the emergence of the Asian economies and China in particular, the dominant influence of the US economy on the commodity cycle has waned. Most commentators attribute the recent escalation of commodity prices to the increase in demand for raw materials by China in the wake of this country’s ongoing economic growth and industrialisation. Two factors are frequently mentioned as part of the explanation of China’s impact on global commodity prices. Firstly, China’s large population of over 1,3 billion and the associated large pool of unskilled labour have contributed to increased competitiveness and has led to China being the leading manufacturing production centre of the world. This has in turn kept the demand for commodity inputs in manufacturing high. Secondly, China’s industrialisation comes at a time of ongoing globalisation, which has contributed to overall demand for commodities globally. China’s contribution to global growth in the consumption of base metals in recent years has been considerable. According to the IMF World Economic Outlook, between 2002-2005, China’s contribution to world consumption growth in aluminium, copper and steel was around 50 per cent. Furthermore, China contributed in excess of 80 per cent to increased world demand for nickel and tin. More significantly, over the same period, China accounted for all the consumption growth in lead and zinc, and for 30 per cent of world consumption growth in oil. Due to its rapid growth and rising share in the world economy, China is expected to retain its critical role in driving commodity price movements. The recent increase in food prices has been the result of a number of factors including a weaker US dollar, the impact of higher energy and fertiliser prices, crop-specific supply shortfalls and droughts, and low inventory levels. Some analysts suggest that higher global real incomes have also contributed to the upward pressure on food prices. An increasingly important driver of agricultural prices comes from the strong demand for bio-fuels, which has seen the diversion of agricultural output to energy production. Although a number of countries have made significant strides in bio-fuels production, the United States and Brazil together account for more than 70 per cent of worldwide production of ethanol. 2 BIS Review 73/2007 
5.  The commodity price boom and the markets In recent years, investor interest in commodities has increased in line with the rise in commodity prices and increased global liquidity. Trade in commodity indices, which total approximately US$100 billion has increased by a factor of 20 in the past decade. This is still relatively small compared to other asset classes but there has been a proliferation and diversification of the investor base including hedge funds and asset managers who have seen commodities as a means to diversify portfolio risk and take advantage of the high yields that have been achieved. Significantly, investors are increasingly viewing commodities as a long-term investment. The financialisation of commodities has also been boosted by developments in financial engineering, with strong growth underlying contracts and investment strategies. Expectations of continued and sustained growth in Asia, particularly in India and China, have served to fuel the increased demand for commodity asset classes. A deeper and diversified market can bring benefits in terms of market efficiency. For example the fact that it is easier to hedge future production reduces the risk of new productive investment which may otherwise take some time to come on stream. A related issue concerns the role of speculators who are regarded by some as being responsible for price volatility in the market. Recent evidence, however, suggests that this may not necessarily be the case. A recent study conducted by the Chicago Futures Trading Commission showed that speculative traders were not leading but rather responding to market developments. This suggests that speculators have tended rather to stabilise the market. Developments in the financialisation of commodity markets may, however, raise several financial stability questions for central banks and financial sector regulators. In particular, it is not certain whether regulators have enough information about the exposures of financial institutions to the prices of their export commodity or about how firms’ foreign exchange exposure could compound their commodity exposures. Moreover, a rise in commodity price volatility could make domestic financial assets more volatile. An additional challenge for central banks stems from the credit exposure to the primary production sectors of the banking system and pension funds which have significantly increased their exposure to commodity assets. Furthermore, central banks should always be alert to sudden declines in commodity prices that may bring about deflationary pressures and financial instability in the domestic economy. 6.  Economic policy challenges  Despite the positive impacts of higher commodity prices on the economy, they also create various problems and challenges for economic management. For commodity-exporting countries, commodity price booms bring with them the concern about the possibility of Dutch Disease, which arises when a booming primary sector causes the real exchange rate to appreciate, and this in turn puts pressure on the manufacturing and other tradable sectors of the economy. The concern is even greater when the cycle turns and the loss of markets by the manufacturing sector is not easily reversible.  From a fiscal policy perspective, the challenge that arises relates to the management of windfall revenues. To the extent that tax revenues are boosted by the commodity boom, there may be a need to smooth expenditure and not treat the revenue increase as permanent. A number of primary-commodity exporters, for example Chile and Norway, have created national wealth funds to ensure that expenditure can be maintained when the commodity cycle declines and tax revenues fall. Monetary policy would be concerned with the possible impact of commodity price increases on inflation. Ironically, the strong non-oil commodity price increases have not translated into generalised inflation. In fact the commodity boom has coincided with a long period of low global inflation. Part of the reason may lie again with China and globalisation. High rates of productivity growth in China have allowed for the production of a wide range of goods at low prices despite the increased costs of inputs. In a highly competitive globalised world market and credible monetary policies, product price increases have remained low or prices have even fallen in some instances. Oil and food prices, however, appear to be posing more of a threat to the global inflation outlook than other commodities. Nevertheless, contrary to initial fears, the impact of rising oil prices has had less of an impact on inflation and output than in previous episodes of oil price increases. This may be because of a general decline in oil intensity in many countries and more credible monetary policy frameworks. However, oil and food prices have been the driving forces of recent inflation developments in South Africa and pose the major upside risks to inflation both here and abroad. BIS Review 73/2007 3 
Monetary responses to terms-of-trade shocks such as oil price increases are not straightforward and depend in part on the magnitude and duration of these shocks. In essence, the issue boils down to distinguishing between permanent and transitory changes in these prices, and how the first- and second-round effects are likely to influence future inflation outcomes. In general, central banks are not likely to change monetary policy in response to commodity price fluctuations. Monetary policy should address the risks emanating from possible second-round effects, i.e. adjustments in expectations triggered by movements in commodity prices which may exert an impact on the inflation process.  7.  Conclusion Not surprisingly, in our uncertain world, there are conflicting views on the outlook for commodity prices. Some believe that commodity prices will fall back to their long-term declining trend. Others however, foresee a sustained boom, or at worst a levelling off at higher levels, given the ongoing industrialisation in China and other emerging-market countries. Whatever the future course of commodity prices, there is little doubt that it will have an impact on our economy. In essence, the policy responses will depend on the macroeconomic impact of the price movements. In this regard, the effect of commodity price movements on inter alia the trade balance, aggregate demand, exchange rate and fiscal developments are of paramount importance. From a monetary policy perspective, our key concern is the possible impact on inflation. Food and oil prices are likely to remain an upside risk to the inflation outlook in South Africa. Monetary policy has to be sensitive to the impact of these developments on inflation expectations and we will act appropriately to prevent the emergence of more generalised inflation. The South African Reserve Bank remains committed to its primary mandate of ensuring price stability, that is the maintenance of CPIX inflation between the target range of 3 to 6 per cent. Finally, commodities will retain a central role in the South African economy in the future. A challenge facing our country, and one that is of particular relevance to this audience, is to ensure that women also play their rightful role in this area of economic activity. To this end the recognition of the achievements of women plays a significant role in fostering their interest in all sectors of the domestic economy.  Thank you. 4 BIS Review 73/2007 
Rasheed Mohammed Al Maraj: Developing the global Islamic financial markets Speech by His Excellency Rasheed Mohammed Al Maraj, Governor of the Central Bank of Bahrain, at the 2nd International Islamic Financial Markets Conference, Manama, 18 June 2007. *      *      * Your Excellencies, Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen – Good Morning. It is a great pleasure for me to welcome you all today, and to help inaugurate the start of this important event, the 2nd International Islamic Financial Markets Conference, here in Bahrain. I should like to take this opportunity to express my own personal appreciation for the distinguished panel of speakers. I should also like to commend the IIFM, and the Islamic Research and Training Institute, for putting together a stimulating programme of topics for the next two days, and for their active support of the development of the Islamic finance industry. Thanks are also due to the many corporate sponsors of this event, for making this event possible, and to the many attendees, whose participation is also essential to the success of such events. The theme of this conference – “Developing the Global Islamic Financial Markets” – is particularly pertinent. The Islamic finance sector continues to demonstrate strong growth, and higher levels of market penetration. It is also fast internationalizing. But it has also reached a stage where it faces some interesting challenges, if it is to really take off as a major component of global financial market activities. These challenges revolve around the continuing need to achieve greater alignment and convergence, without which the vision of deep and liquid global Islamic financial markets risks being compromised. By greater alignment and convergence, I am referring specifically to the need for further progress in terms of aligning the accounting standards and prudential regulations applied to Islamic finance, as well as the development of standardized instruments and market practices. Greater harmonization in these areas is critical, in my view, in order to help sustain the rapid growth and internationalization of Islamic finance. To state the obvious, such differences create additional costs for internationally-active firms and competitive distortions, as well as reduce transparency for investors and counter-parties. Of course, this is a challenge facing conventional finance as well. But the relative newness of modern-day Islamic finance means that the disparities in approaches in these areas are somewhat greater in this industry.  This issue has already been widely aired, and efforts are of course being made to narrow these differences – more on this in a moment. But broadly speaking further progress continues to be required, and I therefore call on all jurisdictions to intensify their commitment to achieving greater alignment. For its part, the Central Bank of Bahrain will continue to provide its own strong support to initiatives aimed at narrowing these differences. With respect to accounting standards, the policies set by AAOIFI, the Accounting and Auditing Organisation for Islamic Financial Institutions, provide a solid framework for Islamic financial institutions. Bahrain is one of the few jurisdictions to have made its standards mandatory, although others use them as guidelines. Further promulgation of these standards would help increase consistency in accounting and sharia standards. Similarly, in the field of financial regulation, we support the work of the Islamic Financial Services Board in developing various prudential standards, and would encourage other jurisdictions to also commit to implementing these standards over time. And finally, the third critical pillar under this heading is that of developing standard contract designs and associated documentation. Progress here will help address the concerns sometimes expressed about the impact of different sharia rulings on the structuring of instruments, and the lack of certain types of instruments. It will also be instrumental in encouraging more liquid Islamic capital markets.  BIS Review 73/2007 1 
This critical third pillar, of course, is in many ways why we are here today, and I should like to pay tribute to the sterling efforts now under way within the industry, with the leadership of the IIFM, to tackle these issues. I am now hopeful that real progress in this area is now within our grasp. You will hear during this conference updates on the initiatives now underway, in conjunction with the International Capital Market Association and the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, to develop Sharia compliant hedging instruments, as well as standardized repo and commodity murabaha contracts. These will be important breakthroughs for the industry, and we very much look forward to their realization later this year. These initiatives have gained good support from the industry, but I would also call on regulators to help support these initiatives: we too can also play an important role in bringing about greater alignment, by encouraging the use of standardized contracts and documentation, where appropriate. On this positive note, I should like wish you a productive conference, and to thank you for your kind attention. 2 BIS Review 73/2007 
Grant Spencer: Recent intervention by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand in the foreign exchange market  Opinion article by Mr Grant Spencer, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, 27 June 2007. *      *      * On 11 June, the Reserve Bank confirmed that it had intervened in the foreign exchange market to sell New Zealand dollars. This was the first such intervention since the exchange rate was floated in March 1985.  The Bank’s 11 June announcement has prompted a lot of discussion and commentary around the objectives and impact of FX intervention. It is useful to clarify a number of issues around this subject.  Foreign exchange intervention is an ongoing process and the Bank will not be commenting publicly on its specific intervention activities. We will, however, continue to release our financial accounts, which show the accumulated impact of the Bank’s intervention activities. These accounts are posted on the Bank’s website at the end of each month, with a lag of one month. Under the Bank’s Policy Targets Agreement with the Minister of Finance, the Bank seeks to avoid unnecessary variability in interest rates, output and the exchange rate as it goes about maintaining low inflation. The Bank’s primary monetary policy instrument is the Official Cash Rate (OCR). The foreign exchange intervention framework provides an additional tool for the purpose of trying to moderate the extremes of the exchange rate cycle.  Intervention operates at the margin, affecting the balance of demand and supply for the New Zealand dollar. It can have an immediate downward impact on the exchange rate as it did on 11 June. That can help to moderate the “peaks” in the exchange and the length of time we spend at peak levels. It does not attempt to defend a particular level of the exchange rate. Rather it sends a signal that, in the Bank’s view, the exchange rate is out of alignment with the economic fundamentals. Those speculating in the New Zealand dollar need to be aware that the exchange rate is not a one-way bet; they need to be cautious.  The Bank’s policy is to intervene only when the exchange rate is at exceptional levels; when it is unjustified by medium term economic fundamentals; when intervention is seen as consistent with the Policy Targets Agreement; and when market conditions make intervention opportune.  In recent times, the New Zealand dollar has been at levels that the Bank regards as both exceptionally high and unjustified by the economic fundamentals. Many businesses would agree. The high level of the exchange rate is creating challenging conditions for large parts of the tradables sector, particularly for those not directly benefiting from the recent rise in world commodity prices. With New Zealand’s current account deficit sitting around 9 percent of GDP, it is our view that the exchange rate cannot be sustained at current levels over the medium term. Does trying to lower the New Zealand dollar run counter to monetary policy and the Reserve Bank’s low inflation objective? We do not believe so. Intervention is about seeking to moderate the trend in the exchange rate and rebalancing monetary policy pressure. It does not fundamentally alter monetary policy and does not signal a future easing of conditions. The direct liquidity impact of FX interventions is always offset via the Bank’s money market operations.  The mechanics of foreign exchange market intervention are quite simple. The Reserve Bank acquires foreign currency reserves by selling New Zealand dollars. This activity may be limited by the amount of foreign reserves we are prepared to accumulate; but is not limited by the Bank’s ability to supply NZ dollars. In this sense, intervention to lower the NZ dollar is less restricted than in the reverse situation where intervention is working to support the NZ dollar by running down reserves.  Many countries around the world have policies which allow foreign reserves to be built up as the exchange rate rises and reduced when their currencies come under pressure. Unlike many commercial traders, the Reserve Bank has the scope to hold additional foreign reserves for an indefinite period. When the exchange rate eventually falls to a more sustainable level, the holding of foreign reserves should become profitable as their value will increase in New Zealand dollar terms. Claims by some observers that the Bank has somehow “thrown away” taxpayers’ money by intervening simply do not stack up. BIS Review 73/2007 1 
FX intervention is a supplementary monetary policy tool and is considerably less potent than the central OCR instrument which has an important influence on the trend of the exchange rate. As noted in the Bank’s June Monetary Policy Statement, the outlook for the OCR will depend on how inflation pressures evolve over the months ahead. Evidence that inflation pressures are abating will be an important step in seeing the exchange rate return to more sustainable levels. 2 BIS Review 73/2007 
Mary C Nkosi: Profile of the Reserve Bank of Malawi Speech by Mrs Mary C Nkosi, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Malawi, during the African Bible College students’ visit to the Reserve Bank of Malawi, Lilongwe, 4 May 2007. *      *      * Mr. Jason Pink, Leader of Delegation, African Bible College  Mr Eckton Chinyanga, Member Staff  Students of African Bible College  The General Manager  Senior Management  Heads of Department  Members of Staff  I would like to welcome you Mr. Pink, staff and students to the Reserve Bank of Malawi. It is my pleasure to see you and your team, visit this institution today. Such visits accord the Bank an opportunity to explain to the public in general and to students in particular, the activities that take place at the institution. I am hoping that you will be able to relate what you learnt in class with what you are going to hear and see during your visit today.  Let me start by saying that the Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM) is a central bank. As such it is charged with many responsibilities which include the attainment of price stability or low inflation and ensuring a sound financial system to facilitating economic growth and development.  The Reserve Bank of Malawi was established under an Act of Parliament in July 1964 (Caption 44:02) and started its operations in June 1965. In April 1989 the Reserve Bank of Malawi Act was revised stipulating the Bank’s principal functions which are in the interest of the national economy and are in line with the economic policies of the government. The 1989 Act made the Reserve Bank independent from government under section 4.  At this juncture, let me touch on the functions and responsibilities of the Reserve Bank of Malawi. These can be split into 3 main parts:  A. Main functions of the Bank  B. Delegated functions of the Bank  C. Other functions of the Bank  Departments in the Bank are set up in such a way so as to fulfill these functions and responsibilities.  A.  Main functions of the Bank 1.  Formulation of monetary policies and maintenance of price stability  The main function of the RBM is to maintain price stability in the economy so as to minimize inflation.  • It does this by controlling money supply growth using 4 major policy instruments: Open market operations, liquidity reserve requirement, the discount rate and repurchase arrangements.  2. To issue legal tender currency in Malawi  The RBM is the only institution that is legally authorised to produce statements that can be used as final means of payment for goods and services within the borders of the country.  3.  Preserving the value of the Kwacha both externally and internally  The Reserve Bank ensures that the exchange rate is stable at all times. Thus it strives to ensure that:  BIS Review 73/2007 1 
•  Money that is in circulation in the country should be backed by an equivalent level of foreign reserves.  4. Banker and advisor to the government  The Reserve Bank maintains government accounts and manages government domestic debt.  5. Banker to other banks in Malawi  The Reserve bank acts a banker to the commercial banks by keeping commercial banks deposits, which can be withdrawn by commercial banks when they run out of liquidity in their vaults.  6.  Acts as lender of last resort for financial institutions  The RBM helps to alleviate liquidity pressure in the financial system. It does this by lending to banks through the Discount Window.  B.  Delegated functions  On behalf of the Government of Malawi, the Reserve Bank of Malawi carries out the following delegated responsibilities:  1.  Establishment of money and capital market  The RBM is the authority responsible for regulating and supervising the proper functioning of money and capital markets. It is responsible for the development of the capital market and for the provision of rules and regulations for fair and orderly market conditions.  2.  Supervision of financial institutions  To promote financial sector development the Bank carries out orderly management and supervision of banks and other financial institutions to protect their liquidity, equity base and ensure their overall viability and stability.  3. Issuing of government paper and Treasury Bills  The RBM is vested with the responsibility of issuing Local Registered Stocks and Treasury Bills as a way of raising resources for Government to augment its revenues. The Bank also underwrites i.e. meets the difference in case of under subscriptions from the financial sector, the parastatals and the private sector.  4.  Administration of exchange control  The administration of exchange control was delegated to the Reserve Bank by the Ministry of Finance on 2 June, 1965.  • Currently there are no restrictions on the Current Account. However, the Capital Account has not yet been liberalised.  C. Other functions  1. To promote development and economic growth in Malawi  The Reserve Bank of Malawi implements several measures designed to influence the money supply and availability of credit, interest rates and exchange rates with the view to promoting growth, employment, stability in prices and a sustainable balance of payments position.  2 BIS Review 73/2007 
2.  Conducting research  Collecting and analysing economic data from the financial and other sectors for research and policy purposes.  Before I conclude, it is important to note that for the RBM to function effectively there are a number of departments that carry out several functions aimed at meeting the institutional objectives. The following are the departments; Research and Statistics, Treasury, Exchange Control and Debt Management, Banking and Payment Systems, Bank Supervision, Supervision of Non-Bank Financial Services, Currency Management, Legal Affairs, Administration, Information, Communication and Technology, Accounting and Finance, Internal Audit, Risk Management, Human Resource and Institutional Development, Protective Services and Public Relations. There will be brief presentations from some of the departments where most of what I have said will be clarified further. In addition, you will go around some of these departments to see what goes on there. I hope that we can have an exciting exchange of ideas after going through these departments.  Once again, we are pleased to have you here and please do take the opportunity to learn about this unique institution.  Lastly, let me take this opportunity to invite you back to this room where your burning questions should be asked and possible responses given.  Thank you for your attention.  MAY GOD BLESS YOU ALL.

Nout Wellink: Microfinance – small loans, big differences Speech by Dr Nout Wellink, President of the Netherlands Bank and Chairman of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, at the Roosevelt Academy, Middelburg, 1 June 2007. *      *      * Today is special. You represent the very first graduation year of the Roosevelt Academy, and undoubtedly there awaits a bright future for you all wherein chances of success will abound. Clearly your accomplishment also signals the big achievement by the Academy and its faculty members. Today, I wish to talk to you about another success story, namely that of microcredit. The UN designated 2005 the International Year of Microcredit. The aim was “building inclusive financial sectors and strengthening the powerful, but often untapped, entrepreneurial spirit existing in communities around the world.” The Year of Microcredit has proved highly successful. It has raised awareness around the globe about the importance of microfinance in fighting poverty and empowering the poor by enhancing higher incomes and more jobs. In other words, microfinance can promote economic and social inclusion. Permit me to address the issue of microfinance in greater depth. “Microfinance” generally stands for financial services for the poor. Microfinance is important because well over three billion people do not have access to basic financial services such as credit, savings accounts and insurance. Microfinance can offer such basic financial services, which is of prime importance to these people. These financial services are provided by so-called "microfinance institutions" (MFIs) or "microlenders", which are simply generic terms for the estimated 10,000 diverse entities such as commercial banks, NGOs, credit unions, finance companies etc. While from now on I will have microcredit in mind when referring to microfinance in general, please keep in mind that microfinance services are much broader and also include insurance, deposit taking and sometimes even pensions. However, the most important element of microfinance today is still micro credit. Let me therefore begin by explaining what microcredit is, how it works and whether it helps poor people to improve their living standards. Thereafter I will discuss the market for microcredit. In particular, I will focus on initiatives that have been taken in the Netherlands. With pride I can say that the Netherlands is amongst the frontrunners when it comes to developing and supporting new initiatives in the field of microfinance. The fact that Her Royal Highness princess Maxima was a member of the Advisors Group to the United Nations International Year of Microcredit 2005 has undoubtedly contributed to the growing involvement of the Dutch in microfinance. And, she continues her work as a member of the UN Advisory Group on Inclusive Financial Sectors. Finally, by way of a conclusion I will identify some challenges for the future. Microcredit – what is it? Microcredit is the extension of very small loans (micro loans) to the unemployed, to poor entrepreneurs and to others living in poverty who are not considered bankable. These individuals typically lack collateral, steady employment and a verifiable credit history. Therefore they cannot meet even minimal qualifications to gain access to traditional credit. Microcredit is a financial innovation which originated in developing countries where it has successfully enabled extremely impoverished people (mostly women) to engage in self-employment projects that allow them to generate income and to begin to build wealth and ultimately to exit poverty. Thanks to the success of micro credit, many people in the traditional banking industry have begun to realize that these microcredit borrowers can be seen as pre-bankable. Microcredit is gaining credibility in the mainstream finance industry. Many traditional large finance organizations are now considering microcredit projects as a new source of future growth. How does microcredit work? As you all know, microfinance has been invented by Nobel Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus, who was here last year when he received the Four Freedoms Award by the Roosevelt Foundation. In the 1970’s Professor Yunus was working at the Chitttagong University in Bangladesh. At that time, he started experimenting with providing small loans to the people in the villages surrounding the BIS Review 72/2007 1 
university. In 1976 he started the now famous Grameen Bank with help from the government. The goal was simple: providing small loans to the very poor. Regular banks would not provide such loans because they considered them too risky – poor people typically lack collateral – and too costly. The small scale of the loans and high monitoring costs for each individual loan typically increase operational costs.  An interesting feature of Grameen bank’s initial lending methodology is that loans were provided to groups rather than to individuals. Let me briefly illustrate how some of those first schemes worked in practice. Two members of a five-person group receive their loans first. If all instalments are paid on time, the initial loans are followed four to six weeks later by loans to two other members. After another four to six weeks, the remaining member, known as the group chairperson, receives his or her loan – of course provided all goes well. In the beginning the group was typically seen as a source of solidarity. For example, when one member could not repay the loan, the group chairman could help out. In this way the credit record of the defaulted borrower would remain clean, and thereby also that of the group as a whole. Over time, formal sanctions by the bank became more common. If one or more group members failed to repay, all group members would be cut off from future loans. The incentive to help each other out in times of need, but also to check on each others repayment record, became stronger through this joint liability system. In practice the group lending methodology functioned well, as repayment rates were generally high. Group lending is not only beneficial for the poor people as they gain access to credit, it is also an advantage for the microfinance institution that is providing the loans. Part of the responsibilities of the microfinance institution, such as monitoring loans and enforcing repayments, are taken care of through the group’s own checks and balances. In this way the operational costs of microfinance have reduced and it becomes possible to give poor people loans that would otherwise not be available or at least would not be available at such low interest rates. The group lending methodology thus increases social capital and efficiency.  Effect on poverty and economic development With innovative concepts such as group lending it is possible to give poor people access to credit. An obvious next question is: what does this credit do for them? Can people actually improve their living standards with the help of micro credit? There are basically two ways to answer this question. The first way is to look at the data and the available scientific studies and carefully assess the results. This is how central bankers typically approach economic questions. The second way is to pack your bags, hop on an airplane, and see for your self how microcredit affects the lives of people in developing countries. Let’s start with the second approach, which is not so common for central bankers, but undoubtedly no less illuminating. My personal experience with microfinance in Ghana has been very positive. And this holds for many observers who have witnessed the activities of microfinance institutions on the ground. But is microcredit really an effective means to alleviate poverty? Are the high expectations justified and can we establish a clear causality between microfinance and higher socio-economic welfare? To answer this question, we have to go beyond personal experience and also look at the data and results of the available scientific studies. However, there has been surprisingly little scientific work on the effectiveness of microfinance programs. According to some experts this may be explained by the fact that many donors who finance microfinance institutions are focussed on reaching as many poor people as possible. Evaluating programmes is often seen as a waste of time and money – and let me say that from a practical point of view such a perception is understandable. But, from a broader policy point of view, it is important to know which concepts work best and which concepts are less effective. Careful experimentation with sound control groups may provide such insights. Another explanation for the limited degree of scientific evaluation is lack of data. Often there are simply not enough data available to study the effectiveness of microfinance. Moreover, the available data may be of limited use because, for example, accounting definitions differ between institutions in the microfinance industry. I therefore welcome recent initiatives, for example by the World Bank, to improve the quality of reliable data to increase our current knowledge. With these shortcomings in mind, the available studies provide a rather positive picture of microfinance and confirm my personal observations. It turns out that microcredit helps people to increase their income through entrepreneurial activities. The effects are often larger for women than for men and seem to diminish if the size of the loan increases. This latter result suggests that the smallest loans can actually make the biggest difference! And that women remain an important target group. 2 BIS Review 72/2007 
The market for microcredit and initiatives in the Netherlands The prospect for the microcredit industry in general is strong. The market is growing rapidly and supply can hardly keep up with demand. It is estimated that only 4 percent of global demand for microfinance services is being met. Note that the potential global microfinance market is worth roughly $300 billion, although estimates vary widely. Also, with the growing development of the microfinance sector, sources of funding for MFIs have diversified. Official donors are no longer the primary source, as tens of microfinance funds and more and more private sector investors are also offering capital to MFIs and are rapidly commercialising microfinance. These investors are typically private-sector funding arms of donors and socially motivated, privately-managed investment funds financed by public and private capital. Although both types of investors generally take a commercial approach in the rigor of their investment analysis and monitoring, they are not always fully commercial in the sense of trying to maximise profit. The Dutch involvement in microfinance has not been left to chance. On the contrary, already in 1997 the first effort was made to co-ordinate microfinance activities by several co-financing agencies (Cordaid, Hivos, Interchurch Organisation for Development Co-operation and Novib) and their main funder the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. With the growing involvement of other private and commercial organisations in microfinance there was a need to include a larger and more diverse group of actors in this initiative. So, in January 2003 thirteen organisations agreed to formalise their efforts to co-ordinate and work together. They jointly established the Netherlands Platform for Microfinance. Dutch organisations that support the microfinance sectors in developing countries through investments or subsidies can join. Since its establishment the Platform has grown to comprise fifteen organisations. To give you some idea of what the Platform does: in 2005 the Platform invested over Eur 360 million in the form of loans, equity investments, guarantees, seed capital and subsidies; this is up more than 50% from the Eur 225 million in 2004! These investments reached more than 550 organisations in 78 countries that offer financial services to poor people, ranging from community-based organisations, co-operatives, non-governmental organisations, banks and other financial institutions. A large share of this money has been invested in Latin America, followed by Asia, Central and Eastern Europe. Surprisingly, Africa has the lowest share (around 12%). The West still seems to lack the commitment to truly help this continent forward. The distribution over the four regions has by and large remained steady over the last three years. This reflects the fact that in general microfinance markets have matured, especially in Latin America, compared to the development of the sector on the African continent. But, although the market for microfinance is growing and more and more organisations are supporting this development, there remain important challenges for the future.  Challenges for the future – by way of conclusion If we truly wish to succeed in providing microfinance services to the poor on a large scale, further contributions are desperately needed. This is not only an issue of financing. Regulators and governments, in particular, need to develop legal and regulatory frameworks for microfinance, consumer protection, and financial infrastructure. Also prudential supervisors – and as a prudential supervisor myself I find this very important – can contribute to the growth of microfinance by defining clear criteria for microfinance institutions. This pertains in particular to institutions that wish to take deposits from the public or expand their services cross sectorally. And, last but not least, perhaps you yourselves as successful graduates of the Roosevelt Academy can also make a contribution to the success of microfinance, as future investors, entrepreneurs, or simply by telling others in your environment about the potential of microfinance. The latter can actually prove to be very effective, as you undoubtedly have a bright future as the next generation of influential professionals in our society. BIS Review 72/2007 3 
Anselmo L S Teng: Financial innovation and the win-win outcome for the regional economy  Speech by Mr Anselmo L S Teng, Chairman of the Monetary Authority of Macao, at the Pan Pearl River Delta Regional Cooperation and Development Financial Forum, in Chang Sha, Hunan Province, 9 June 2007.  *      *      * Honourable officials, Dear representatives,  Ladies & gentlemen, I am pleased to have the opportunity to participate in today’s forum. On behalf of the Monetary Authority of Macao, I would like to share with you some viewpoints on the theme – “Financial Innovation and the Win-Win Outcome for the Regional Economy.” On this occasion, I would like to thank the elaborate planning and assiduous efforts displayed by the financial academies from nine provinces in organizing this forum and the meticulous arrangement made by the organizers and co-organizers. Here, I sincerely wish this forum a great success in materializing the objective of a win-win outcome for the region.  First, I would like to update you on Macao’s economic and financial status. Then, I will share with you some of my views on the main theme. As it is commonly known, the Macao Special Administrative Region is small with a rather limited economic capacity. Nevertheless, since the return to the Motherland, the Macao SAR is capable of achieving rapid economic growth with record achievement noted in the financial sector. This favourable result is attributed to the auspices of the Central Government and the fraternity of the provinces, cities and regions. In the first quarter of 2007, we achieved a real GDP growth of 25.6%, after having attained 16.6% in 2006. Rapid growth in foreign direct investment, private consumption and tourism services were the main propellers for the economic performance. Besides, we witness that the policies and measures diligently pursued by the MSAR government for proper economic diversification is taking shape. Apart from gaming, other forms of tourism such as corporate travel, culture and leisure, sports, convention and exhibition have been growing briskly. Meanwhile, change is also observed in the source of inbound tourists. Traditionally, China, Hong Kong and Chinese Taiwan are the major source of inbound tourists. Today, tourists coming from East Asia, Europe, the U.S.A., Japan, Korea and Australia have been growing at a faster pace. Other business sectors, including the financial sector, also enjoy better growth opportunities in the face of substantial gains recorded in overall consumption as well as local and foreign investments.  The local financial sector accounts for around 10% of GDP. It mainly consists of 27 banks and 25 insurance companies, which are mostly subsidiaries or branches of banks and insurance companies outside Macao. It is recognized as a pillar industry in terms of its total assets or its contribution to GDP. Buoyed by rapid local economic growth and sustained development in the neighbouring economies, the banking sector managed to achieve record performances year after year. As at the end of the first quarter of 2007, total assets of the banking sector grew by 22.3% year-on-year to MOP281.1 billion; deposits increased by 18.2% to MOP236.4 billion; loans reached MOP78.1 billion, representing an increase of 18.1%. Non-performing loan ratio was at record low of 1.1%. The overall profit for the first quarter jumped by 30.3% to MOP1.09 billion, after a notable result of MOP3.9 billion scored for the full year of 2006. Consolidated capital adequacy ratio of the whole sector at the end of 2006 was kept at a high level of 14.7%, well above the minimum 8% required by the Basel Committee. The favourable performance has not only reflected the result of the fast growth of the local economy and sustained development of the neighbouring economies, it is also the result of the unrelenting effort of the banking sector devoted to enhancing its risk management and financial innovation.  Financial innovation is a perpetual endeavour for the financial industry which covers a broad and wide-ranging scope. I consider that it should embrace new financial ideas as well as improving existing ones; in general, it covers the following 4 aspects:  1. Innovation in 3 main financial structures: financial market, financial institutions and financial products; BIS Review 72/2007 1 
2. Innovation in 3 main financial channels: public financial infrastructures, internal operational facilities and external services measures; 3. Innovation in 3 main users of the financial system: government, enterprises and residents; 4. Innovation in 3 main financial regimes: financial rules and regulations, financial supervision and cross-border financial cooperation. If the above definition of financial innovation is established, its realization will vary in accordance with time, place and people involved.  It would be unrealistic for Macao to realize an overall financial innovation. Macao’s development is confined by many objective factors such as limited capacity, absence of a comprehensive financial market and lopsided economic structure. As such, our financial innovation effort is restrained by inherent factors. Nevertheless, all along, we have been actively promoting financial innovation in line with the needs of economic development which can simultaneously maintain the sustainable development of the financial industry in a stable and sound manner.  Being an operator, the local financial sector has been remarkable in financial innovation. In the past few years, we have witnessed the emergence of various types of financial products, ranging from telephone banking, mobile banking, online banking, investment fund, bankassurance, personal banking, private banking to privileged banking services.  Being a regulator, we allow adequate freedom to financial enterprises by adopting appropriate measures to innovate our system. To cope with actual market environment, we revise or relax enforcement of certain regulatory requirements subject to the premise that there is a thorough understanding of risk management capability of the sector. Furthermore, we continue to enhance our regulatory practice by conducting onsite investigation for a specific purpose. We gather thorough knowledge of a certain facet within a relatively short time span. Upon completion of the investigation, we share mutual findings with the inspected institutions in a timely manner with minimum disruptions to the their daily operation while they all stand to benefit.  Being a facilitator, we organize activities for the industry participants to cultivate business opportunities locally and overseas through cross-border exchange and cooperation via various channels, especially liaisons with our regulatory counterparts and arrangements with other governments.  In comparison, the Mainland market is boundless. The government is easing control on financial regulations as reform of the financial system is moving forward on all fronts. The pattern of economic development and household consumption is changing while the Mainland economy continues to grow rapidly. Regional and global economic integration is gathering steam. Development in the securities market and the pervasiveness of renminbi carries profound implications. The combined effect of all these forces has not only contributed to the establishment of a solid and sound foundation conducive to financial innovation, it has also brought creative opportunities for financial innovation to the regions that are closely connected with the economic and financial development of the Mainland. The PAN-Pearl Delta Region, 9 provinces and 2 special administrative regions are vast in area, each has its own competitive edge and solid economic strength. Their governments, business sectors and residents have comparatively better knowledge about finance. Against this backdrop, there is a great future for financial innovation. Although I have mentioned earlier that Macao has limited experience in this respect, I would like to take this occasion to share with you the following observations:  1. Appropriate laws and regulations are needed to foster a regulatory environment that is conducive to financial innovation. It is worthwhile to attempt new ideas as long as they would not contravene the requirements of existing laws and regulations. However, we must have a full understanding of the related risks. And, we must have an appropriate risk control system or measures to mitigate or eliminate the risks. Apart from complying with necessary regulatory procedure, the new ideas must facilitate market development without impairing the rights of consumers. To this end, the QDII scheme for stock investment can serve as a classic example. The introduction and moderation of the QDII scheme as well as the gradual opening of the Mainland capital market represent an important step towards financial system reformation. These measures are also financial innovation conducive to financial market development. Based on this situation, we can expect more innovation in financial policies. In the near future, a wave of keenly anticipated innovations in financial institutions, products, service and cooperation will arise from innovated financial policies.  2 BIS Review 72/2007 
2. There should be ongoing observation of changes in market development, analysis of special needs of customers, segmentation of customers and markets, as well as the establishment of a system to trace the demand of market and customers. The regulators should proceed in tandem with the pace of market development and monitor changes and characteristics of consumer demands. As far as financial products are concerned, asset management and structural financing that are selling like hot cakes are good examples. 3. Financial innovation should be adapted to time, place and people. This issue has been explored before with Macao as an example. 4. Maintain good communication between regulators and market participants. It is normal for regulators to receive tons of complaints and enquiries from consumers. As these letters are mostly pinpointing financial products and services, regulators would gain a better understanding or come up with a general idea on the types of services demanded by consumers during the course of handling these complaints and enquiries. 5. Investors and consumers need education. It is desirable to initiate a two-pronged measure. Based on the objectives of protecting the rights of the consumers and investors as well as facilitating the penetration of the financial market, the regulator can actively embark on financial consumption related education through various channels such as the media and topical exhibitions etc. On the other hand, the market participants are encouraged to launch more promotions that are infused with educational elements. This approach allows the participants to exploit potential business opportunities while fulfilling certain social responsibilities. 6. Cross-border exchange and cooperation are imperative. Apart from taking into full consideration the elements of time, place and people, we can benefit from observing the achievement of others in financial innovation. For products or services that are sophisticated or distinctive, we can study the concepts, repackage or adapt them for introduction to the local market. Much can be gained and shared from getting to know other markets through cross-border exchange. Through mutual understanding and interaction, we have better understanding of other markets and hence better knowledge. Since the return to the Motherland and the signing of the Closer Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA), economic ties between Hong Kong, Macao and the Mainland have much strengthened. There will be profound implications if trade transactions between these places can be settled in Renminbi. This is a form of financial innovation which can only be materialized through cross-border cooperation involving not only the trading of commodities but also cooperation between the governments concerned. Now, I would like to share with you another live experience. As we all know, since the return to the Motherland, the Macao SAR government has been trying to turn Macao into a service platform for the Mainland and Portuguese-speaking countries by capitalizing on the historical relationship that Macao built up with the latter. Financial cooperation between Portuguese-speaking countries and MSAR has flourished from mere acquaintance. In September 2006, the Bank of China (Macao Branch), BPI of Portugal and its Angolan subsidiary, BFA, signed a tri-partite cooperation agreement in the annual “Macao International Trade & Investment Fair” (“MIF”). This agreement covers financial services including remittance made available to Chinese enterprises and workers in Angola. This appears to be a very simple cooperation arrangement. However, a closer look shows a few special features. Traditionally, similar arrangements involve only two parties. Now, this one involves one more party for a specific reason. The arrangement is not concluded for business between Macao and Angola or between Macao and Portugal. It is specially arranged for transactions between Angola and the Mainland. From this example, there is great potential for financial innovation in the area of cross-border cooperation. Besides, we believe that much can be achieved between the Pan-Pearl Delta Region and its brother provinces and regions, between Macao and the Mainland, as well as between the Mainland and Portuguese-speaking countries through Macao as the intermediary The above is a summary of my basic viewpoints on the theme of this forum. It provides merely food for thought which I hope can lead to further elaboration from the audience.  Thank you! BIS Review 72/2007 3 
Lim Hng Kiang: Trade links and business opportunities for Singapore Congratulatory remarks by Mr Lim Hng Kiang, Deputy Chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore and Minister for Trade and Industry, at the Daiwa Securities Group 35th Anniversary, Singapore, 25 June 2007. *      *      * Your Excellency Mr Takaaki Kojima, Ambassador of Japan to Singapore, Mr. Shigehara Suzuki, President & CEO Daiwa Securities Group Inc., Mr. Shin Yoshidome, President Daiwa Securities SMBC, Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen. Good Evening, I am delighted to be here this evening for the joyous occasion of Daiwa Securities Group’s 35th anniversary in Singapore. This marks yet another important milestone for Daiwa, and your continued commitment to Singapore.  Daiwa’s growth story in Singapore Set up in 1972, Daiwa has grown from strength to strength over the years. From the early collaboration in 1971 with Development Bank of Singapore to issue the first Asian Dollar Bond, Daiwa has over the years expanded to provide a full spectrum of financial services. Today, all of Daiwa’s major business units are represented in Singapore, covering securities brokerage, investment banking, asset management and more recently, wealth management as well.  Singapore has also grown to become a key node in Daiwa’s overseas network, managing your business operations in South Asia & Oceania.  I am encouraged to hear that on the occasion of Daiwa’s 35th anniversary celebrations, you have also announced plans to boost activities in Singapore and the region. I understand these new activities include M&A and private equity investments. These are all very positive developments and you will be joining a vibrant community of financial institutions here in Singapore. Japan and the region’s recovery and growth Daiwa’s increased focus in South Asia attests to the dynamism of the region. Not only has the region shown resilience, it is now powering ahead. Led by ASEAN economies such as Vietnam, which is surging ahead strongly, India, Pakistan and the Middle East too are beckoning out to investors with their growth prospects.  Trade and investments within the Asian region, and between Asia and the Middle East continues to grow. Notably, Japanese foreign direct investments into ASEAN has been increasing steadily again since 2003. In fact, it has reached more than US$6.4 billion1 which even outpaced that into China in 2006.  The Japanese economy too, continues to impress. Economic conditions in Japan have improved remarkably and the data released suggests a continued and sustained growth. Japanese corporates are raking in record profits and capital investments too are surging ahead. They have once again begun to spread their wings overseas. Supporting these corporates, financial institutions like Daiwa too have benefited from this increased business activities.                                                       1  Sources: Prepared by JETRO from Ministry of Finance Balance of Payments Statistics and Bank of Japan foreign exchange rates.

Partner to growth Where does Singapore fit into this climate of abundant growth opportunities? Located right at the confluence of trade links and business opportunities, Singapore has become a valuable partner to corporates and financial institutions like Daiwa. With more than 2,500 Indian companies, 2,300 Chinese companies, and 2,000 Australian and New Zealand companies in Singapore, corporates have made Singapore their location of choice to tap into this growth.  However, Singapore’s value transcends our physical proximity to the fastest growing regions of the world. Indeed, Daiwa’s extensive commitments and new activities in Singapore is the best testament of our successful efforts to create the best possible business environment. It highlights recognition of our stable and trusted environment, supported by reliable infrastructure, highly educated workforce and consistent and transparent government policies.  To further enlarge the market, Singapore has forged important linkages to the rest of the world. We have built up a network of Free Trade Agreements with many of our key trading partners such as Japan, the US, India and Korea. Discussions are ongoing with the Gulf region and China for greater market access for Singapore-based entities. A Connectivity Agreement between Singapore and Vietnam will amongst others, deepen collaboration in financial services, and promises greater opportunities for businesses from both countries.  Conclusion On this note, I would like to convey my heartiest congratulations to Daiwa Securities Group on your 35th anniversary in Singapore. The future of the region continues to shine bright and I encourage all to leverage on Singapore to tap into the region’s growth.  I wish everyone a wonderful evening ahead. Thank you.  2 BIS Review 72/2007 
Jean-Pierre Roth: “A franc remains a franc” – 100 years of National Bank policy in support of monetary stability Address by Mr Jean-Pierre Roth, Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank for International Settlements, at the official ceremony of the 100th anniversary of the Swiss National Bank, Zurich, 22 June 2007. *      *      * Honoured President of the Swiss Confederation Honoured Prime Minister of the Principality of Liechtenstein Honoured members of the federal parliament Honoured representatives of the cantonal governments Honoured governors of fellow central banks Honoured guests Almost to the day 100 years ago, the Swiss National Bank opened its doors at the head offices in Berne and Zurich and the branch offices in Basel, Geneva and St Gallen. This marked the end of around 16 years of parliamentary work that had followed the acceptance, in 1891, of a constitutional article leading to the establishment of a central note-issuing institution for the whole of Switzerland. This prolonged process can definitely be explained by the fact that our countrymen, at the end of the 19th century, did not see any urgent need for the establishment of a central bank. In fact, the political debates prior to 1907 mainly focused on questions relating to the organisation of the bank and the distribution of its profits; the regulatory role that the new institution was to assume was hardly touched upon. The new National Bank was expected to gradually take over the activities of the former note-issuing institutions and to bring some welcome order to the payment system. At the time, the value of the Swiss franc was defined in gold and silver, the precious metal content of the coins was fixed accordingly and banknotes could be exchanged for gold. Nowadays, the SNB’s responsibility in matters of monetary stability is uncontested. In fact, it is explicitly mandated by law to preserve price stability while taking economic developments into account. Moreover, economic theory stresses the special responsibility of central banks in this area. The goals, methods and instruments of monetary policy have thus undergone profound changes. Nevertheless, the principles that have guided our activity over the past century have been remarkably enduring, and this is exemplified by the history of the National Bank. Pursuit of stability From the outset, the National Bank recognised that its role as the national note-issuing institution would extend far beyond the harmonisation of payment systems. The first steps were difficult. During the First World War, the SNB actively participated in financing military expenditures through its loans. This undisciplined lending policy pushed up inflation, thereby contributing to the social unrest of 1918. This sparked a broad debate on the SNB’s responsibility for the massive price rise. These events, along with the subsequent tragedy of German hyperinflation, left a strong mark on the National Bank. It must have been at that time that the SNB fully realised the complexity of its task. In particular, it recognised how important it was to preserve the country’s good monetary health – and this was long before the law made price stability a priority goal within the SNB’s policy. Since then, and even during the most turbulent phases of the 20th century, the determination to ensure monetary stability has emerged as a guiding principle for the National Bank’s activity. In its quest for stability, the SNB strove to apply the rules of the gold standard consistently, accepting the Federal Council’s decision to devalue the Swiss franc in 1936 reluctantly, as a trial imposed upon it from outside. Also, when Switzerland found itself isolated in the Second World War, the SNB tried to avoid repeating the mistakes made during the First World War so as not to further aggravate an already difficult situation through monetary instability. Preserving domestic stability and maintaining the country’s ability to meet international payments were thus accorded priority. After the War, the new order established at the Bretton Woods conference was intended to ensure international monetary stability. However, this goal was not achieved. In Switzerland, the disequilibrium in the balance of BIS Review 71/2007 1 
payments became even more exaggerated, and the fight against inflation called for the joint efforts of the Federal Council and the National Bank. In 1973, the National Bank decided to stop intervening on the foreign exchange market and to float the Swiss franc. This measure was also designed to safeguard monetary stability, which was jeopardised by the massive inflow of speculative funds. Maintaining the internal balance in a highly unstable international environment was the main focus of the monetary policy decisions in the years that followed. In Switzerland, price stability has been ensured since 1994, but it was only ten years later that it was also made a statutory goal of our policy. Central bank autonomy This constant pursuit of monetary stability would not have been possible if the National Bank had not been able to act independently – an essential advantage – since the day it was founded. The principle of central bank autonomy is widely recognised nowadays. Price stability can be better ensured if the institution responsible for conducting monetary policy has a clear mandate and can act independently of third-party instructions. This realisation has led to many central banks being granted independence during the last 20 years. In Switzerland, the debate on the status of the future National Bank took place at the end of the 19th century. In 1897, a project for the establishment of a state bank located in Berne and placed under the direct control of the Federal Department of Finance was adopted by parliament, but the proponents of an independent note-issuing bank to be domiciled in Zurich launched a referendum, and the law was rejected in a popular vote. As a compromise, the legal status of the new central bank was situated somewhere between that of a public and a private sector institution and it was given two head offices, one in Berne and one in Zurich. From the beginning, it thus occupied a special place in Switzerland’s political landscape. This special status has hardly changed over the years. In the 1930s, when devaluations and the abandonment of the gold standard often resulted in tighter government controls over central banks, the National Bank Act remained unchanged. Likewise, at the end of the Second World War, when many central banks were nationalised, the SNB remained a stock company open to private shareholders, and it has maintained this status to this day. Since 1973, following the abolition of fixed exchange rates and the introduction of an autonomous monetary policy, the circumstances under which this principle of independence is implemented have changed progressively. A growing need for transparency vis-à-vis the public and the authorities has emerged. This is why we have developed a strategy of active communication, and our relationship with the federal authorities has been gradually institutionalised. Nowadays, transparency and accountability have become principles of good governance for all independent central banks. In Switzerland, the revised National Bank Act of 2004 obliges the SNB to present an annual accountability report on the execution of its mandate to parliament. Application of rules Independence is not merely a theoretical concept, it must be lived constantly. Very early on, the National Bank realised that it could defend its autonomy and strengthen confidence in the Swiss franc by adopting rules of conduct. From the start, it strove to adhere to the rules of the gold standard and maintained this policy until the system of fixed exchange rates collapsed in 1973. With the Swiss franc losing its traditional anchor, the SNB was forced to adopt new rules. This was achieved 18 months later with the publication of annual growth targets for the money supply, a strategy which was pursued until 1999. Since 2000, our interest rate decisions have been based on our medium-term inflation forecast and our definition of price stability, which we consider achieved if annual inflation remains below 2%. The second constant in the National Bank’s activity over the past 100 years has been its adherence to the rules of monetary discipline. This strategy has allowed us, as it did our predecessors, to conduct a coherent monetary policy over all these years while shielding our institution from all kinds of demands, both economic and political. 2 BIS Review 71/2007 
Willingness to adapt Given the strong disruptions in the international environment in the past 100 years, pursuing a policy of stability and applying the rules of monetary discipline has not been an easy undertaking. Let us not forget the obstacles we encountered in adhering to the rules of the gold standard and the fixed exchange rate system in times of war or during major international upheavals. Let us also remember the difficulties that money supply targeting caused in the context of financial market deregulation in the past 20 years. Quite often, the implementation of our policy was undermined by a highly unstable international environment. The ability to adapt, therefore, became crucial. Our predecessors demonstrated this willingness to adapt to new developments time and again, for example, when Switzerland had to be reintegrated in the international system of payments in the post-war period, in the fight against speculative capital inflows in the 1960s, in managing the volatility of the Swiss franc in the 1970s or curbing inflation in the late 1980s. Apparent in all these phases were the same determination to ensure monetary stability, the same commitment to apply rules and the same necessity of having to take an often hostile environment into account. The direction was always clear, but many obstacles had to be overcome along the way. We are celebrating the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the Swiss National Bank in quite exceptional circumstances. Indeed, Switzerland enjoys great prosperity: We are close to full employment, price stability has been maintained for almost 13 years, and the economic prospects are favourable in almost all respects. This enviable situation could not have been achieved without our economy striving for greater efficiency or without its ability to take on new challenges and make the most of the international environment. All this has not been easy, neither for the companies nor for the employees. The good economic situation can also be attributed to the country’s sound financial health. National savings are high, the external accounts are solid, and public finances are on the way to recovery. The National Bank has contributed to this success by ensuring confidence in the Swiss franc – a key factor for the smooth functioning of the economy. As I have pointed out, this commitment is not new, but has been a constant throughout our history. As our predecessors, we are honouring it by following rules that are as clear as possible, while knowing that the uncertain environment in which we operate requires the ability to adapt. Mistakes have certainly been made in the 100 years of the National Bank’s existence. It must be acknowledged, in retrospect, that certain situations were not analysed correctly, that certain decisions were taken too late or were simply inadequate. In some instances, the SNB opted for strictly following the rules rather than searching for solutions that would have been better suited to the realities of the moment. Nevertheless, the outcome has been positive overall. Switzerland has been spared the monetary problems that afflicted so many other countries. However, the purchasing power of the Swiss franc has not been preserved as successfully as one might have wished. The general price level has increased by an average of 2.5% a year since 1907, although this is still only half a percentage point above the range we now equate with price stability. Our currency was created in 1850, and the coins of that time were in circulation in 1907, when the National Bank started operations. We still use these coins today for our day-to-day payments. This is tangible proof of our country’s monetary stability. “A franc remains a franc,” declared the President of the Swiss Confederation in a radio address one day after the 1936 devaluation, in an endeavour to reassure the Swiss people about the abolition of the gold standard. I am pleased to be able to say today – 100 years after the National Bank started business – that a franc has indeed remained a franc. All this could not have been achieved if our policy did not enjoy broad support in our country. I would therefore like to conclude by expressing sincere thanks; first of all to the federal and cantonal authorities for the support that they have given us, particularly in difficult times when we had to make unpopular decisions for the sake of monetary stability. Second, I would like to thank the business community for its understanding of our policy, even at times when we assessed the situation differently or when monetary constraints necessitated painful adjustments. And, finally, my thanks go to the Swiss people for their unwavering confidence in our institution and their support for our monetary autonomy over the last 100 years. BIS Review 71/2007 3 
May the National Bank continue to enjoy such broad support! Through its actions, it will continue to uphold the trust which has been placed in it thus far. 4 BIS Review 71/2007 
Jean-Claude Trichet: Swiss monetary policy as viewed by the European Central Bank Speech by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Swiss National Bank, Zurich, 22 June 2007. *      *      * Madame la Présidente de la Confédération suisse, Monsieur le Président du Gouvernement du Liechtenstein, Ministers, Excellencies, Dear President of the Bank Council of the Swiss National Bank, Dear Jean-Pierre Roth, Dear Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, Dear fellow Governors, Ladies and gentlemen, It is an immense pleasure for me to be here today with such a distinguished audience to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the foundation of the Swiss National Bank (SNB). The SNB is to be especially congratulated because, in spite of the turbulences which have characterised the period since 1907 – two world wars, the Great Depression, and the Great Inflation – it has succeeded in delivering, on average, a remarkably low inflation rate. I regard a historical and international perspective on Swiss price stability as being especially appropriate. A historical and international perspective: a low-inflation country It has been noted that, notwithstanding the Great Inflation episode, and the temporary inflationary outbursts corresponding to the two world wars, the United States should correctly be characterised, when seen from a very long-run perspective, as a low-inflation country. This is a claim made, in particular, by Bradford DeLong in his analysis of the US inflationary experience since the time of the Civil War.1Historical experience suggests that Switzerland deserves such a characterisation to a significantly greater extent. First, since 1880 Swiss annual inflation has been, on average, just 2.2%, to be compared to 2.6% in the US. Second, in an international comparison with 13 other OECD countries since 1880, and excluding from the computation the years corresponding to the First and Second World Wars and their immediate aftermath (in order to avoid a distortion of the results through the extraordinary turbulence associated with the two world wars), Switzerland comes out on top once again, with an annual average inflation rate of just 1.5%. Finally, focusing on the period following the creation of the Swiss National Bank, and excluding, once again, the years of the two world wars and their immediate aftermath, Switzerland, with an average annual inflation rate of 2.1% is, together with Germany, again the best performer. Switzerland’s consistent “credible currency, low-inflation” strategy clearly emerged during the episode which can reasonably be characterised as the Swiss National Bank’s “finest hour”: the Great Inflation of the 1970s. As pointed out by Edward Nelson2, “[i]n Switzerland, […] while a debate on the nature of inflation did take place in the early 1970s, it was resolved quite rapidly in favor of the monetary view, leading to an eschewing of non-monetary approaches to inflation control”. In subscribing to the ultimately monetary nature of inflation, the Swiss National Bank was accepting the lesson of Milton Friedman as remarkably exposed in the Monetary History of the United States3, the single piece of research which – more than any other – contributed to changing policy making. And                                                       1  See DeLong (2000). 2  See Nelson (2007). 3  See Friedman and Schwartz (1963). BIS Review 71/2007 1 
indeed, as emphasised by Robert Lucas in the remarks he delivered at Otmar Issing’s Festschrift one year ago4, “[t]he first central banks to deal effectively with the 1970s inflation were the Bundesbank and the Swiss National Bank, and both did so in the mid-1970s by deliberate reductions in money growth rates. In October 1979 the US Federal Reserve followed suit […].” Monetary policy and monetary aggregates As stressed by Lucas, recalling the Swiss National Bank’s – and the Bundesbank’s, as well as a number of European central banks’, including Banque de France’s –acceptance, back in the 1970s, of the ultimately monetary nature of inflation, and their use of monetary means to bring it under control, is especially important today, when the relevance of monetary analysis for monetary policy is sometimes questioned. As Charles Goodhart sarcastically put it5  “[m]onetarism, in any of its guises, has become somewhat unfashionable; and the New Keynesian three-equation synthesis […] rides high. […] Deviate from this, and you are not a member of the In Crowd.” The reasons why the role of monetary aggregates in monetary policy analysis is today questioned are well known. On the conceptual front, the ascendancy of Neo-Wicksellian theory6 which assigns to monetary aggregates a purely residual role. At the practical level, the breakdown, in several countries, of the empirical relationship between money growth and inflation, which led the former Governor of the Bank of Canada, Gerald Bouey, to famously quip that “ We didn’t abandon monetary aggregates, they abandoned us”. I have three comments on this. First, empirical evidence7 shows that – since the first half of the nineteenth century, and in a number of countries – fluctuations in trend money growth have almost always led to fluctuations in trend inflation, with upswings or downswings in trend money growth having been followed, a few years later, by upswings or downswings in trend inflation. The crucial point to stress here is that the resilience of the lead of trend money growth over trend inflation over time, and across radically different monetary regimes, clearly suggests that such a lead is a structural feature of the economy – that is, embedded in the structure of the system so as to be invariant to occasional changes in the monetary regimes. This empirical finding represents a bedrock fact that any model – including those built on New-Keynesian synthesis principles – has to confront and seek to reproduce. Since, over the last two centuries, fluctuations in trend money growth have almost always been followed by fluctuations in trend inflation in the same direction, an upswing in trend money growth points to the existence of upward medium to long term risks to the inflation profile. In the light of the evidence coming from the last two centuries of data, totally ignoring trend movements in money growth would therefore entail – in my view – excessive and unreasonable risks. The practice of the SNB – and of the ECB – of closely monitoring monetary trends in order to identify long-term risks to price stability is therefore validated by the monetary history of the last 200 years. Second, as recently stressed, in particular, by Philippe Hildebrand at a central banking conference at the ECB8, prolonged periods of low and stable inflation – like those that OECD countries have been experiencing for several years now – can give rise to distortions in empirical analyses, and can make it extremely difficult to correctly assess the informational content of a specific indicator of future inflation. To put it differently, in an equilibrium in which the central bank is successful at keeping inflation low and within a narrow range, the empirical relationship between inflation and any indicator tends to disappear. This is precisely why the experience of the Great Inflation – which can be regarded as the ultimate off-equilibrium event – is important. That persistent and prolonged deviation from equilibrium revealed, in a fundamental sense, the authentic nature of reality, which today, in a stable, low-inflation world, has become more difficult to extract from the data. And so, in the same way as the experience                                                       4  See Lucas (2006). 5  See Goodhart (2006). 6  Exemplified in the work of Michael Woodford. 7  See Benati (2007). 8  See Hildebrand (2006). 2 BIS Review 71/2007 
of the Weimar Republic hyperinflation was the key “founding memory” for the Bundesbank, or the dramatic experience of the revolutionary “assignats” for Banque de France,9 the experience of the Great Inflation can be regarded by today’s central banks as the cornerstone of their institutional architecture. Indeed, as pointed out by the Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve,10 “[g]reater support for independent central banks […] was one of the results of the lessons of the great inflation of the 1970s.”  Third, it is important to note that the link between money growth and inflation can be blurred by systematic fluctuations in the velocity of money. Recent work carried out at the Swiss National Bank11 has shown that, after controlling for systematic shifts in the equilibrium component of money velocity caused by Fisherian movements in the opportunity cost of money, the long-run relationship between money growth and subsequent inflation is still in the data, and not only for the euro area, but also for the United States, where the stability of such a relationship has been most strongly questioned in the past. This finding suggests that monetary indicators should not be hastily discarded when their link with inflation appears to have weakened. Rather, it suggests that monetary data should be subjected to a thorough and broad-based analysis, in order to filter out the noise and to fully understand movements in trend velocity which distort their low-frequency signal for long-term risks to price stability. The new Swiss monetary policy concept: an ECB perspective From 1974 until the end of the century, the Swiss National Bank consistently pursued a strategy of targeting monetary aggregates, announcing targets first for M1, and then, from 1980, for the monetary base. (Only during a very brief period in 1978-1979 did the SNB abandon monetary targeting in favour of an exchange rate target.) Owing to the increasing instability of the monetary base over the second half of the 1990s, however, the SNB decided, at the end of 1999, to announce a new monetary policy framework. The new framework is based on three key elements: • An explicit definition of price stability “[…] expressed in terms of the headline CPI. [The SNB] defines price stability in the same manner as the European Central Bank, [as] a CPI inflation rate of less than 2 per cent per year.”12 • An inflation forecast as the main communication tool in order to explain to the public the rationale behind monetary policy decisions. • From an operational point of view, a range for the three-month LIBOR rate as the way to actually implement policy decisions in practice. I find from time to time statements suggesting that, with its new monetary policy strategy, the SNB has essentially renounced its monetarist past. I believe such a position to be incorrect, and in what follows I will make two main points. First, I will stress the significant elements of continuity with the pre-2000 monetary policy strategy. Second, I will argue that, if one looks carefully at the details, the monetary policy strategy of the Swiss National Bank is, in many respects, quite close to that of the European Central Bank. Let me elaborate on these points in turn. As stressed by SNB staff members13, the SNB “[…] retained important ingredients of monetary targeting in its new monetary policy concept. At various occasions, the SNB stressed that it continues to monitor two sets of indicators providing leading information on future price developments […]. The first set of indicators is useful for forecasting short-run price developments, i.e. over a horizon of one and a half to two years. It includes various indicators of the cyclical state of the economy, notably the output gap and supply and demand conditions in the labour market, as well as the real exchange rate of the Swiss franc. The second set                                                       9  For an analysis of the revolutionary experience with the ‘assignats’, see Sargent and Velde (1995, Section IV, ‘Rise and Fall of the Assignat’). 10  See Kohn (2005). 11  See Reynard (2006). 12  See Jordan, Peyrignet and Rich (2000). 13  See Jordan, Peyrignet and Rich (2000). BIS Review 71/2007 3 
of indicators comprises the monetary aggregates, which provide useful leading information on long-run price developments.” The elements of continuity with the pre-2000 strategy emerge quite clearly, in particular in the form of the important role assigned to a deep analysis of monetary aggregates. The justification for closely monitoring monetary aggregates, their components, and their counterparts, is the same as that given by the European Central Bank, namely the information content they comprehend as regards inflation in the long run, which has been documented for both Switzerland and the euro area. Precisely because of this long-run link with inflation, and of the previously mentioned lead of trend money growth over trend inflation, a strong upward trend in money growth points to the existence of upward risks to the profile for trend inflation. When the ECB started raising rates in December 2005, for example, monetary analysis, and a close monitoring of trends in a number of money supply indicators, played a crucial role, by highlighting risks to the inflation profile which were not, at the time, immediately apparent just from the economic analysis. As the “Financial Times”14 recently pointed out, the decision to raise rates, at that time “controversial”, has been, 18 months later, “vindicated” by subsequent events. The SNB’s differentiation between the two groups of indicator variables – on the one hand, short to medium-run indicators, such as a range of statistics including, prominently, inflation itself; on the other hand, monetary indicators, mostly relevant at a longer horizon – is clearly reminiscent of the ECB’s “two-pillar” strategy. And research undertaken at the SNB15 has indeed shown such a dichotomy to provide a good characterisation of short-term and medium to long-run inflation dynamics for both Switzerland and the euro area. A further important element common to both the SNB and the ECB is that neither central bank adjusts its policy by mechanically reacting to deviations of the inflation forecast from their respective definitions of price stability. Rather, both central banks focus on low-frequency – that is, trend – movements in the variables of interest, and both are willing to see through the shocks that buffet the economy occasionally from a medium-run perspective if overall macroeconomic circumstances require it. There are, of course, also differences between the monetary policy strategies of the ECB and the SNB. For example, as I have already mentioned, at the SNB monetary information is taken into account in the construction of the inflation forecast, while at the ECB the results from the monetary analysis are used by the Governing Council to cross-check – on the basis of an expanding range of monetary tools – the signals coming from the economic analysis. In a sense, the SNB delegates the “cross-checking” activity to the projection process, whereas the ECB assigns that responsibility to the Governing Council, once the projection process has run its course independently. At that point, we cross-check the outputs coming from models and formal frameworks, often from within a variety of non-nested alternatives. We adopt something similar to what my friend Alan Greenspan would call a Bayesian approach to policy and Alan Blinder would describe as a rough approximation of optimal information processing: “Use a wide variety of models, and don’t ever trust any one of them too much.”16I view these differences as minor. Our two central banks conduct similar exercises in robust policy-making within a shared framework of common principles: a clear definition of price stability, a medium-term policy orientation, and an important role assigned to monetary indicators for the assessment of longer-term risks to price stability. Conclusions Permettez-moi en conclusion, cher Jean-Pierre, cher Président, de souligner trois points.  D’abord, il est particulièrement émouvant pour l’ancien gouverneur de la Banque de France que je suis, d’être à Zurich. Nous avions célébré le 200ième anniversaire de la Banque de France, il y a 7 ans, en rendant un vibrant hommage à un citoyen suisse. La Banque de France a été créée par                                                       14  See “Under fire, on target”, by Ralph Atkins and Lionel Barber, “Financial Times”, 18 May 2007, page 9. 15  See Assenmacher-Wesche and Gerlach (2006a, 2006b). 16  See Blinder (1998, page 12). 4 BIS Review 71/2007 
Napoléon en 1800 sur une proposition du financier Jean-Frédéric Perregaux, qui en a été ensuite le responsable. Monsieur Perregaux était l’un de ces financiers suisses, à la fois très imaginatifs, très sages et très prudents, dont la réputation est légendaire à travers les siècles. Anschließend möchte ich hervorheben, wie vorbildlich die Beziehungen sind, die alle Zentralbanken der Welt mit der Schweiz sowie der Schweizerischen Nationalbank unterhalten. Die Offenheit der SNB und ihre aktive Beteiligung an geldpolitischen Fragestellungen und der geldpolitischen Forschung auf europäischer und internationaler Ebene werden sehr geschätzt. Jean-Pierre Roth, dem wir unsere regelmäßigen Zusammenkünfte in Basel zu verdanken haben, leistet als Präsident des Verwaltungsrats der Bank für Internationalen Zahlungsausgleich hervorragende Arbeit. Ihm möchte ich heute meine besondere Anerkennung aussprechen. Finally, let me particularly emphasise that price stability is a necessary condition for sustainable growth and sustainable job creation. I made the point recently several times that since the creation of the Euro on the 1st of January 1999, during the first eight years, more than 12 million jobs were created in the euro area. I underlined it could be compared with less than 3 million during the eight years before the Euro. I also stressed that the current level of unemployment, at 7.1%, is the lowest for 25 years. Can I also stress here in Switzerland that the sound and wise monetary policy of the Swiss Central Bank and the level of price stability which has been attained throughout the last hundred years are one of the major causes of the full employment success of your country.  I thank you for your attention.

Tiff Macklem: Global integration, monetary policy, and the international monetary system Remarks by Mr Tiff Macklem, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada, to the Winnipeg CFA Society, Winnipeg, Manitoba, 21 June 2007. *      *      * Good afternoon. It's a pleasure to be in Winnipeg, and it's an honour to join you as you celebrate the CFA Institute's sixtieth anniversary. Today is the longest day of the year. But I don't want it to feel that long, so I'll get right to the point. I'd like to discuss two aspects of global integration – how it's affecting our economy, and why it underscores the need for a sound monetary framework, both at home and internationally.  Now, Manitoba – right in the middle of our vast country – might seem an odd place to talk about globalization. But this province, like the rest of Canada, is very much affected by global economic forces. Some businesses – particularly in the manufacturing sector – are facing fierce competition from new suppliers in emerging Asia. Other businesses are benefiting from strong foreign demand and high prices for commodities. Most of Manitoba's exports go to the United States, so it might be tempting to think that what really matters is North American demand. But the prices of many of Manitoba's exports – both commodities and manufactured goods – are set in world markets, and thus influenced by the demand for, and the production of, these goods in Asian and other emerging-market economies. So, Manitoba, and Canada as a whole, are very much a part of the integrated world economy. I'll start by highlighting two key developments in the global economy and describe how they're affecting Manitoba and Canada. Then I'll discuss how monetary policy helps Canada to weather, and indeed to profit from, changes in the global economy. I'll wrap up by returning to the international stage and suggest that, in an increasingly integrated world economy, we all have a greater stake in a sound international monetary system.  Developments in the global economy  As trade barriers have come down, and as the costs of transportation and communication have diminished, international trade has grown and living standards have improved. Since 1970, trade as a share of GDP has risen from about 25 per cent to almost 45 per cent in industrialized countries. Over the same time period, trade in emerging-market economies has increased from less than 15 per cent of GDP to roughly 60 per cent. Much of the recent growth in trade has come as large emerging-market economies, such as China and India, have been integrating into the world economy. With this integration has come a significant increase in the global demand for commodities, as well as rapid growth in the production of manufactured goods in Asia.  That brings me to the first of the global developments I'd like to mention – a marked rise in the prices of commodities relative to those of manufactured goods. In the past five years, energy prices have risen by about 150 per cent, and non-energy commodity prices have increased by about 80 per cent. Over the same time period, the price of nickel – Manitoba's biggest commodity export – has risen by about 500 per cent, and the price of copper has increased by more than 300 per cent.  At the same time, the prices of many manufactured consumer goods, such as clothing, computers, entertainment equipment, and household appliances have decreased in many countries. In Canada, the prices of durable and semi-durable manufactured goods, excluding automobiles, have declined by about 1 to 2 per cent per year, on average, over the past five years (although more recently, prices for semi-durable goods have strengthened). Given its endowment of natural resources, Canada has benefited greatly from strong commodity prices. But, just as clearly, new competition from China and other emerging Asian economies is posing some tough challenges for Canadian manufacturers.  Global integration has also been affecting international savings and investment flows. Indeed, in the past dozen or so years, what is sometimes called "financial openness" has increased significantly. Since 1995, the stock of cross-border investment in advanced countries has grown from about 40 per BIS Review 71/2007 1 
cent of GDP to more than 120 per cent of GDP, and emerging markets have seen a similar increase, albeit from a lower base.  This leads me to the second development I want to highlight. In recent years, desired global saving appears to have increased relative to desired global investment, which has made credit abundant and relatively cheap. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has called this a global "saving glut." The International Monetary Fund has emphasized the weakness of global investment relative to global growth. But whether it's high saving or low investment, the net effect is that large pools of internationally mobile capital have been searching for seemingly scarce investment opportunities, putting downward pressure on long-term interest rates. As investors have searched for higher returns, risk spreads have narrowed, and interest in alternative investments and more innovative investment vehicles has expanded. While there are several reasons for this abundance of global credit, global integration is almost certainly an important part of the story. Saving rates in Asia are relatively high and exceed the region's investment needs. In addition, with the sharp rise in the price of oil in recent years, a number of the major oil-exporting countries have seen a large increase in their saving that has outstripped the growth of their investment demand. With the integration of these economies into world markets, and with investors seeking international diversification, new pools of capital have been injected into the global financial system.  How is Canada faring?  How have these developments been affecting the Canadian economy? I'll discuss them in reverse order. The implications of abundant global credit are readily apparent. Long-term interest rates in Canada have been low. Even with some back-up in yields in recent weeks, yields on 30-year Government of Canada bonds remain well below 5 per cent. The Canadian stock market has been buoyant, and risk spreads on corporate debt are near historical lows. Household credit and money growth have been strong, and cross-border investment flows have accelerated. The rise in the prices of commodities relative to manufactured goods has reinforced many of these same effects. Since Canada is a net exporter of commodities and a net importer of manufactured goods, the rise in commodity prices has made Canada wealthier as a nation. The increased value of Canada's natural resource endowments is showing up in higher domestic stock market prices and increased cross-border investment flows. It has also been a major factor supporting robust consumption and investment growth in Canada. And of course it's showing up in a higher Canadian dollar.  In the past five years, the Canadian dollar has gained about 45 per cent against the U.S. dollar. This appreciation since 2002 reflects a combination of factors, the most important of which is the significant increase in commodity prices. The other implication of the rise in the relative price of commodities is economic adjustment, by which I mean the reallocation of labour and capital from weaker sectors to stronger sectors. The manufacturing sector, faced with higher costs for energy and other inputs, new sources of competition from Asia, and a stronger Canadian dollar, is going through a difficult adjustment. Our own surveys suggest that most manufacturers are responding to these challenges by making changes in the way they do business. Part of this adjustment has involved reducing employment. In the past three years, employment in manufacturing has declined by about 250,000 jobs. At the same time, the primary and service sectors have been expanding capacity and employment in response to strong demand. Over the past three years, employment in these sectors has increased by about 900,000 jobs, more than offsetting the reduction in manufacturing employment.  Of course, this adjustment is not affecting all parts of the country in the same way. Growth in output, employment, and incomes has been fastest in Western Canada. Nevertheless, growth in Canada has been broad based. Strength in domestic demand has supported solid growth of output and employment right across the country. Manitoba is in the middle of Canada in more ways than one. It has a well-diversified economy that closely resembles the structure of the Canadian economy. And in the past three years, GDP in Manitoba has grown by an average of 2.8 per cent, very close to the national average. 2 BIS Review 71/2007 
Economic adjustment is always difficult, but it's necessary if we are to put capital and labour to work where they are most needed. This, in turn, helps to support rising living standards for Canadians. The main point here is that the Canadian economy has adjusted – and is continuing to adjust – to take advantage of our opportunities in an integrated global economy. Now let me turn to the role played by monetary policy.  The role of monetary policy The Bank of Canada Act directs the Bank to "promote the economic and financial welfare of Canada." What we've learned from experience is that the best contribution monetary policy can make to Canada's economic and financial welfare is to maintain low, stable, and predictable inflation.  Since 1991, Canada's monetary policy framework has consisted of two main elements – an inflation target and a flexible exchange rate. This framework has allowed Canada to pursue an independent monetary policy – a policy suited to our own circumstances. The two main elements work together and reinforce each other. The result has been low and stable inflation, with less volatility in output and employment. Let me elaborate on each of these elements. First, the inflation target.  Since 1995, the target for inflation has been the 2 per cent midpoint of a 1 to 3 per cent inflation-control range. To keep inflation at 2 per cent, the Bank tries to keep a balance between the overall demand for and supply of goods and services in the Canadian economy. When overall demand and supply are in balance, the economy can operate at its full potential, and inflation is stable.  Inflation control contributes to better economic performance in several ways, but let me highlight two that are particularly relevant in the current context. First, when inflation is low and stable, relative price signals are clear and readily apparent, and this helps businesses and households to make sound economic decisions. Second, meeting the inflation target helps to anchor inflation expectations to the target which, in turn, helps to keep inflation low and the economy more stable. In the 1970s, which was the last time Canada experienced a commodities boom on the scale of recent experience, monetary policy failed to anchor inflation expectations. So, when sharply higher oil prices pushed inflation up, workers and firms extrapolated this higher inflation forward, and prices and wages more broadly began to rise more quickly. The result was higher and more variable inflation, and a more painful economic adjustment.  The other element of our monetary policy framework is the flexible exchange rate. The flexible exchange rate helps the economy to absorb shocks. Just as the Manitoba Floodway absorbs some of the deluge of a spring flood, the floating dollar helps the economy to absorb shocks – especially external shocks that affect our economy differently than those of our major trading partners. The flexible exchange rate also supports economic adjustment because it is much easier to have changes in the relative price of Canadian goods and services come through movements in the exchange rate than to require all domestic prices and wages to adjust. Now, I said that the inflation target and the flexible exchange rate work together to promote our economic well-being. What this means in concrete terms is that relative prices can change without spilling over into generalized inflation, and the economy can operate close to its potential. This means that labour and capital are allocated more efficiently, and resources that move out of contracting sectors are put to work in expanding sectors. And that's what we've been seeing in Canada. With unemployment at a 33-year low, it's clear that Canada has been going through this difficult process of adjustment with considerable success. Our job at the Bank of Canada is to continue to aim for 2 per cent inflation so that when some prices change, these are clearly relative price changes, and longer-run inflation expectations remain anchored at the 2 per cent target.  To summarize, our monetary policy framework has served us well in maintaining a domestic environment of growth and stability. Together with other domestic policies, it has helped Canada to adjust to some significant changes in the global economy.  But sound domestic policies are not sufficient to eliminate spillover effects from decisions and events on the other side of the world. And, while global integration creates new opportunities, it also poses certain risks. In particular, if other countries fail to pursue sound policies, we could see abrupt changes in global financial conditions, with harmful spillover effects in Canada and elsewhere. It is this possibility that points to the need for a global table where countries can come together and take BIS Review 71/2007 3 
account of their economic and financial interdependence. A stable global economy is in everyone's interest. The international dimension This is where the International Monetary Fund (IMF) fits in. It is the institution best placed to fulfill this role. With 185 member countries, the IMF truly spans the globe. And with a large, well-trained and very professional staff, the IMF has the "human capital" to analyze the increasingly complex linkages among economies. The IMF began operations 60 years ago – in fact, just as the predecessor of the CFA Institute came into being. The IMF's mandate was to promote international economic growth and financial stability. This mandate remains relevant today. But a great deal has changed since the IMF first opened its doors. The IMF was set up to oversee the global monetary system in an era of fixed exchange rates. Today, flexible exchange rates are the norm; private capital flows dwarf IMF resources; financial markets are much more sophisticated and vastly more interconnected; and major new players are integrating into the global economy. To be effective in this world, the IMF must change the way it pursues its mandate.  Recognizing this challenge, the IMF's managing director, Rodrigo de Rato, launched a strategic review of the Fund's role in 2004. The review covers a number of elements. The most critical is to decide exactly what the IMF should do to fulfill its mandate. I will focus my remaining comments on this issue. To be effective in a much larger and more integrated global economy, the IMF needs to become a more proactive institution, focused on limiting negative spillovers and preventing financial crises. And this means that the IMF needs to strengthen its main crisis-prevention tool – surveillance of its member countries and of the global economy.  We need IMF surveillance to help member countries set sound policies, and to provide all members with the assurance that everyone is playing by the rules of the game. We need the IMF to evaluate the coherence of policy frameworks across countries, to assess the spillover effects of one country's policy choices on other countries, and to speak out when countries thwart adjustment to economic fundamentals to the detriment of other countries. And we need the IMF to be an effective global forum where members can come together to address international economic and financial issues.  The groundwork for improved surveillance has been laid. As announced by Mr. de Rato three days ago in Montréal, the Fund and its members have just completed a revision of the guiding framework for surveillance. This is the first significant revision of the surveillance framework in 30 years, and it is a major accomplishment. The next step is to implement this framework. This will require establishing and periodically updating clear priorities and responsibilities for surveillance. Implementing the revised framework will improve the quality, the candour, and the even-handedness of IMF surveillance.  Under the revised guiding framework, surveillance will focus on the four pillars of macroeconomic policy – exchange rate, monetary, fiscal, and financial policies – as they affect external stability. In implementing improved surveillance, it will be important to better integrate financial sector analysis and assessments into country reviews, and to take a broader, multi-country perspective. It is also very important that IMF surveillance be – and be seen to be – even-handed. This means that all members – not just those on fixed or managed exchange rates – should come equally under Fund surveillance. Improving Fund surveillance by applying best practices universally across its membership would benefit all members. Conclusion I promised at the outset not to take advantage of this being the longest day of the year. So, allow me to conclude with three key points.  First, adjusting to a changing world economy is difficult, but Canada is doing well by profiting from new opportunities and responding to new global realities. Our monetary policy framework is helping the Canadian economy to absorb external shocks and to adjust to changing circumstances. Second, sound domestic policies are central to maximizing the benefits of globalization, while minimizing the risks. But as global markets grow and broaden, and countries become more 4 BIS Review 71/2007 
interconnected, we have an increasing stake in a sound international monetary system, and in an institution to support it. Third, and finally, the IMF is best placed to be that institution. But to realize its potential, we need to modernize the way it pursues its mandate. A process of renewal is well under way, and it is important that the IMF and its members seize the opportunity to build an IMF for the 21st century. BIS Review 71/2007 5 
David Dodge: Important issues related to the development of international capital markets Remarks by Mr David Dodge, Governor of the Bank of Canada, to the Government Borrowers Forum, Montréal, Quebec, 15 May 2007. *      *      * Thank you, it's a pleasure to welcome you here today to discuss some important issues related to our common interest in the development of capital markets throughout the world. We are all interested in seeing the continued development of international capital markets, as part of the advancement of a market-based, liberalized trade and financial regime. Let's remember that an open, market-based economic system is increasingly vital, in a world where change is driven by the development of new technologies and modes of competition; and where adjustments are occurring all the time. In such a world, price signals from markets can help us to understand what adjustments need to be made. A liberalized, market-based regime is really the best that we have found for promoting growth and prosperity, higher standards of living, and the development of a domestic economy that is flexible enough to cope with shocks.  There are, of course, many policies needed for an economy to become more flexible and market-based. But today, I want to particularly focus on the importance of local-currency bond and money markets. First, however, let me briefly outline the other necessary policies.  Fundamentally, a commitment to maintain low, stable, and predictable inflation is crucial. In most countries, that commitment is best supported by a flexible exchange rate regime, which facilitates adjustments when the inevitable shocks to relative prices, global trade, and capital flows occur. One other important policy is that governments must be fiscally responsible. This doesn't mean the books must be perfectly balanced each and every year. But it does mean that governments must maintain, and be committed to maintaining, a manageable debt-to-GDP ratio, and avoid running up debt that can hobble future governments, and prevent necessary adjustments. And finally, openness to global trade is of key importance to an economy's growth and prosperity.  A great deal of attention is rightly paid to these very important policies, which form the essential building blocks in an economy. But today, I want to focus on the issue of having sound local-currency bond and money markets.  First, I'll talk about the real advantages right at home that come with local-currency bond and money markets. I'll also refer to Canada's history in developing such markets, and to some elements that remain a work in progress. I hope that our experience might be of some use to authorities in many emerging market economies, which are now developing their own local-currency markets. And their efforts are bearing fruit – the outstanding stock in these emerging economies' local bond markets now exceed $4 trillion US – a four-fold increase in value over roughly the past decade. I'll also consider how these domestic markets can fit into, and do their part in stabilizing, the global financial structure.  Now, these are my personal observations which are based on 40 years experience in public finance, and as seen from two perspectives: both as a central banker, and before that, as a federal Finance department official. Over the years, I've come to appreciate that a sound local-currency government bond market helps on three distinct policy fronts. First is the discipline that it can impose in terms of macroeconomic policies. Second, it supports economic and financial efficiency. And third, it helps in the development of a stable financial system. Let me now deal with each of these points in turn. In terms of macroeconomic policy, a government must build credibility with its own citizens first of all. Citizens need comfort that the government bonds that they hold will keep their value; that governments won't default on their obligations, or resort to large tax increases or inflation to ease the real burden of repayment. This initial hurdle of building credibility can be difficult to get over, as many emerging markets can attest to today. But once this hurdle has been cleared, a well-functioning, local-currency government bond market brings with it the incentives for authorities to keep in place the sound policies that I mentioned in my introduction. Those policies should include monetary policy aimed at maintaining low, stable, and predictable inflation, which leads to an environment of lower interest rates – both nominal and real – and lower debt servicing costs in the future. They also include BIS Review 69/2007 1 
prudent fiscal policies, which then reinforce public confidence in the government and, in turn, in the domestic markets. Of course, none of this suggests that all government borrowing must be denominated in the local currency. There will be times when a government will borrow in foreign currency, perhaps for projects that will support a future flow of foreign currency that can, in turn, help repay this borrowing. The real risk here comes when governments find themselves repeatedly borrowing in foreign currencies, to finance current domestic spending.  Let me now mention Canada's history in developing our local-currency bond and money markets, because it has parallels with the situation in which many emerging market economies now find themselves. In the 1950s, Canada was a relatively small, but very open economy that relied heavily on foreign trade, was dramatically influenced by fluctuations in commodity prices, and had a long history of foreign capital inflows to finance major projects.  The Bank of Canada's primary emphasis at that time was on the development of a government treasury bill market, to assist in the more effective implementation and transmission of monetary policy. In addition, the Finance Department, with the central bank as its fiscal agent, wanted to promote the development of a well-functioning government bond market. This would help to provide the government with low-cost and stable financing. Moreover, Canada had also moved to a floating exchange rate, and so it was even more important that our debt be issued in the domestic currency. But the authorities also saw the financial system efficiency benefits that could flow from the development of a well-functioning government bond market. In particular, it would support development of, and access to, market-based credit for firms. The broader goal was to develop the foundation for an efficient domestic fixed-income market for private issuers.  Of course, our markets have been continually evolving, and so we have had frequent consultations with market participants. These consultations have led to the development of a well-functioning and liquid market for government debt right across the yield curve. This market provides the pricing benchmarks for all other fixed-income instruments and their derivatives, thus facilitating market access for firms seeking debt financing. So what have we learned over the years? Well, experience has shown that in order to maintain an efficient, well-functioning local-currency debt market, it's helpful to focus on the key aspects of liquidity, transparency, regularity, and integrity in the structure of government bond and money markets. As such, our efficient government debt market contributes to overall capital market efficiency by providing key benchmark and hedging tools.  Now, in terms of financial system stability, the development of our domestic bond and money markets has led to stronger and sounder financial institutions. Stronger institutions and more complete markets facilitate better allocation of domestic savings. This increases domestic investment, and thus, encourages stronger economic growth. Creating local-currency bond and money markets can insulate an economy from global economic shocks in two ways. First, by providing more stable and secure sources of liquidity. And second, and perhaps more important, it can allow for a better matching of the currency of obligations to the currency of receipts. In addition to contributing to a more stable domestic financial system, the development of domestic-currency markets is important to promote global financial stability. Economies with a sound financial system can help to prevent shocks from spreading around the world. The Asian financial crisis of 1997-98 really helped to illustrate how a crisis can spread among economies with weak financial systems, including, in some cases, serious mismatches in foreign currency assets and liabilities. This is why policy-makers around the world have been putting a lot of emphasis on improving domestic banking and financial systems.  To develop a sound financial system requires several policy steps. The BIS Committee on the Global Financial System has outlined five key measures needed to develop deep and liquid bond markets. Allow me to list them. First, an economy must have a competitive markets structure; second, it must have liquid, benchmark bond issues; third, markets must be efficient, with low transactions costs; fourth, markets should be safe, sound and robust; and finally, it's important that there is a wide variety of market participants. I see from your program that these are issues that you will be talking about in more detail later this afternoon. 2 BIS Review 69/2007 
Ladies and gentlemen, I have spoken about how local-currency bond and money markets can help an economy, by giving the authorities incentives to follow good macroeconomic policies, and by supporting financial and economic efficiency. And, I've talked about how such markets can help in the development of a sound domestic financial system. This, in turn, can promote financial stability, both within a country and more broadly, in the global financial system. At the start of a conference like this, I thought it important to use my time to remind ourselves of why it is we need strong, local-currency bond and money markets. Speaking generally, the steps that Canada took in the past to develop its local-currency bond and money markets may be applicable to today's world, and to the various emerging market economies that are now trying to find their own path. But what is certain is that the original principles that guided us in creating those markets – liquidity, transparency, regularity, and integrity – are as valid today as they were 50 years ago.

Timothy F Geithner: Reflections on the Asian financial crises  Remarks by Mr Timothy F Geithner, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, at the Trends in Asian Financial Sectors Conference, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, San Francisco, 20 June 2007. *      *      * It is a pleasure to be here at the San Francisco Fed and to join you in looking back at the Asian financial crises. Many people in this room played critical roles in the drama of that time. We did not always completely agree, but we usually found a way to work together on a common strategy. The crises hit with remarkable speed and force, with substantial effects on the world economy as a whole. The collapse in confidence led to substantial and sustained outflows of capital, forcing large exchange rate devaluations, a sharp fall in asset prices and leaving entire banking systems virtually insolvent. GDP fell by between 10 and 15 percent. The crises forced substantial changes in the IMF’s instruments for crisis resolution and a major international effort to strengthen financial systems.  Even after a decade, the crises are a subject of debate and controversy. For many, they represented a failure of financial globalization, a dramatic demonstration of the perils of openness to capital flows. A popular perception was that economies with strong records of growth and financial management were forced into positions of vulnerability by externally imposed programs of capital-account liberalization and then were pushed into turmoil by an unstable, even predatory international financial system. Adherents of this view tended to view the policy response to the crisis as harsh or inept or both.  Time has taken some of the edge off these criticisms, but they still affect the political debate in the region today. They reflect anxieties about the balance of risks and benefits of economic and financial integration that still play an important role in shaping economic policy, even with the substantial progress achieved since the crises. I want to outline some of the principal lessons of that period, both in terms of reducing vulnerability to financial crisis and in terms of strategies for crisis resolution. I offer these with the knowledge that it is hard for anyone who was not a finance minister or a central bank governor in the region at the time to understand what it was like. As one of those involved in shaping the international response, I can say that there was a lot we did not fully appreciate about the dynamics of the crises then, and that justifies humility today in thinking about the lessons for the future. With those qualifications, here are a few thoughts on four important issues: • the role of balance sheet problems in creating vulnerability to crisis,  • the challenge in designing an appropriate exchange rate regime and monetary policy framework for emerging market economies,  • the conditions for dealing with progressively greater openness to capital flows, and  • the role of policy reforms and financial assistance in crisis resolution.  Currency mismatches and balance sheet problems In general, the crises were the consequence of fundamental economic problems, often manifested in the buildup of substantial balance sheet problems, with excessive short-term borrowing in foreign currency by the sovereign, the banking system, or both. In Asia, the accumulation of short-term debt was concentrated in the banking system. Banks borrowed dollars and yen on a large scale and then lent those funds to corporations that earned their revenues in domestic currency. This created a mismatch between the currency denomisnation of the banks’ liabilities and their assets. And this mismatch created an acute vulnerability to exchange rate risk.  The rapid increase in foreign currency exposure was encouraged by fixed exchange rate regimes, since these created the illusion of protection from exchange rate risk. It was encouraged by tax incentives that favored short-term foreign currency borrowing through offshore banking centers. It was fed by the selective liberalization of capital controls on foreign borrowing, while limitations on equity inflows were left in place. It was exacerbated by classic moral hazard – the result of past government BIS Review 69/2007 1 
interventions to limit corporate and bank failures. And it was made worse by poor disclosure, which masked the scale of the increase in external liabilities and the deterioration in the level of official reserves. The scale of the buildup of foreign currency debt was fundamental to the dynamics of the crises. Once confidence weakened, and fixed exchange rate commitments became unsustainable, the economies experienced a sharp reversal in capital flows as both residents and nonresidents sought to limit their exposure to domestic institutions and assets. This broad flight from domestic assets created conditions similar to a classic bank run. The exchange rate decline magnified concern about potential losses in the corporate sector and banking system, which led to a further shift in assets out of the country, which exacerbated the exchange rate decline. These balance sheet vulnerabilities led to a vicious cycle in which the exchange rate and financial weaknesses reinforced each other. As economies slipped toward the edge of the cliff, policymakers were left with alarmingly few options to try to contain the crisis and mitigate the damage inflicted on the real economy. Given that real interest rates were already negative, relaxing monetary policy further risked accentuating the exchange rate decline, which would, in turn, have exacerbated the problems of the banking system. But with demand already in free fall, policymakers were equally reluctant to tighten policy and risk further damage to growth. Fiscal positions in Asia were far weaker than they initially appeared to be because of the enormous contingent liabilities that governments faced as a result of the collapse of the banking systems. This limited the room for countercyclical fiscal policy, although each government moved eventually to put in place modest fiscal stimulus. This diagnosis of financial vulnerabilities led to a very substantial improvement in the quality of national balance sheets in the region. More on this later. Exchange rate regimes and the perils of the middle A second, and closely related lesson, relates to the exchange rate regime. In the crisis countries, the exchange rate regime of choice had been a fixed but adjustable peg. This was softer than a currency board – the possibility of adjustment was built into the arrangement, but it was presented as a commitment to a fixed nominal exchange rate for an indefinite period of time. Although these regimes of limited exchange rate flexibility had been regarded as a means of achieving economic stability, in fact they turned out to be a source of instability. Nominal exchange rates against the dollar had been held fixed for some time, while real effective exchange rates had appreciated significantly. Because of weaknesses in the financial system, the investment booms of the previous decade had not translated into increased productivity. As investors grew concerned about potential weakness, pressure on the exchange rate further intensified until it became unsustainable. Exchange rate intervention proved ineffective. Once confidence had been shattered, the markets responded with brutal speed and force. Monetary authorities without a record of institutional independence and without a sufficiently clear mandate for price stability did not have the experience or credibility needed to restore confidence quickly. The crises helped bring about a fundamental reassessment of the merits of fixed but adjustable exchange rate regimes, regimes that try to exist somewhere in the middle between the opposite extremes of irrevocably fixed and purely floating. The new consensus, which you can now see in policy choices across emerging markets, is that the soft middle is fundamentally untenable for an economy that is open to cross-border capital flows. With the limited exceptions of those cases where full monetary union or a currency board is optimal, or where a fixed exchange rate can provide a nominal anchor for a disinflation strategy, the general view now is that flexible exchange rate regimes make more sense for emerging market economies.  Exchange rate flexibility offers the advantage of allowing monetary policy to be directed at sustaining price stability, which in turn offers a better prospect of sustained growth. Changes in fundamental factors such as productivity growth and inevitable shocks to demand and supply require changes in relative prices, both domestically and internationally. A flexible exchange rate makes it easier for relative prices to move rapidly and effectively in the appropriate direction and so generally eases the cost of adjustment. 2 BIS Review 69/2007 
Regional economic integration has increased rapidly in Asia in recent years, but these economies still seem a long way from the point where economic or political conditions would make a compelling case for some kind of regional monetary integration. (In Europe, of course, the political case for monetary integration largely preceded the economic argument.) For Asian economies, as for most emerging economies today, the principal challenge is to establish conditions that will enable them to prosper in a world where their exchange rates adjust more freely to changing fundamentals. Capital-account liberalization A third important conclusion from the crises relates to strategies for capital-account liberalization. Although this was not the conventional wisdom at the time, I think the evidence supports the view that the policy mistakes that contributed to the crises lay not in the decision to become more open to capital flows, but in the how those governments chose to become more open. The supervisory and regulatory regimes over the financial system did not provide a strong enough framework of incentives for risk management and controls over financial intermediaries. But the more consequential mistake was that the crisis economies each in different ways chose to liberalize capital controls selectively. Each had in place other incentives or distortions that led to an excessive reliance on short-term borrowing through the banking system. These weaknesses left the financial system and the economies as a whole with less capacity to manage the greater pressures and risks that came with openness to capital flows. The policy consensus that has emerged from this experience has a more cautious view of the benefits of financial integration, a greater awareness of the damage caused by creating incentives that distort the composition of flows and a greater appreciation of the importance of having in place a strong set of institutions, in the financial system in particular. It has also fostered a greater skepticism within governments of their ability to sustain and adjust a set of limited controls on capital flows, once an economy has passed a certain point of relative openness. Money tends to move around these controls with progressive ease, and it becomes more difficult over time to counteract this force with acceptable costs to other objectives. For this basic reason, many emerging market governments that were early proponents of selective controls have moved to eliminate them.  Faced with the challenges of managing policy in an increasingly integrated world economy, the dominant instinct of officials is often to try to shield the economy from volatility. But the crises of the 1990s helped demonstrate why this approach can be both futile and counterproductive. As economies become more open to capital flows, policies designed to insulate an economy from external shocks, whether they be fixed exchange rate regimes or selective capital controls and restrictions on international transactions, rarely offer durable stability, and they bring additional risks. These risks come in the form of additional distortions that might undermine future growth or magnify vulnerability to future financial volatility.  The more promising approach is to invest in the complement of institutions and policies that enable an economy to live more comfortably with openness. Focusing on those measures that will enable an economy to be more flexible and to adapt more quickly to change ultimately will be a more effective policy strategy. It is politically more difficult, but economically more effective than those solutions that seem to offer protection from competition and volatility.  Crisis resolution A fourth lesson, or series of lessons, comes from our experience in crisis resolution. The strategies adopted to stabilize markets and then to foster recovery varied significantly across the crisis economies. Each involved a somewhat different mix of policy reforms and temporary financial assistance, tailored to the different conditions that prevailed. Where there was success, the common feature was what Larry Summers called the Powell Doctrine applied to international finance – the overwhelming use of force, with a clear strategy for resolution. The “force” in this sense applied both to the scale of financing made available relative to the need and to the quality of the policy measures.  Very substantial resources were deployed in support of the recovery efforts, and a large share of the resources was made available upfront, in order to try to mitigate the liquidity problem and to stem the loss of confidence. In contrast to the typical IMF program, governments were permitted to use a BIS Review 69/2007 3 
portion of the IMF-supplied resources to take some pressure off the exchange rate, as foreign investors sought to reduce their exposures to the crisis countries in the initial stages of the crises. But the provision of large external financial resources was not, by itself, sufficient to achieve stability. The critical feature of every program was a set of policy measures designed to address the causes of the crisis, to stabilize confidence and to put in place conditions for recovery.  In some cases, the initial policy response looked tentative or inadequate. In others, the reform program did not appear to have broad support within the government. Broader political uncertainty associated with a pending election or change in leadership also undermined confidence in the commitment to a credible recovery plan. Where confidence in the recovery plan was weak, the financial resources had little impact on market sentiment and confidence faltered. Even though the resources looked large relative to past financial interventions, they were easily overwhelmed when markets were unimpressed by the policy response. Ernesto Zedillo explained the policy challenge exceptionally well when he wrote that since markets tend to overreact at the onset of crisis, so policy needs to overreact too. A classic problem in financial crises is to distinguish between problems of illiquidity and insolvency. This diagnosis is critical to the design of an effective response, but it is very hard to do. We – in this case I mean the IMF, its major creditors and the governments in the region – treated these cases as closer to the illiquidity extreme on the continuum, rather than to the insolvency extreme. In the Asian crisis countries, unlike in Russia or Argentina, there was no plausible case for arguing that the sovereign governments had accumulated debts they were unable to repay. A forced restructuring of the external debt of a country or a forced suspension of payments on those obligations would have made the crisis in Asia, and more broadly, substantially worse. These were not conditions of insolvency, but nor were they purely temporary liquidity problems that could have been addressed through the quick infusion of unconditional finance without any change in policies. The crisis economies all tried that strategy in the weeks and in some cases months before going to the IMF for assistance. Those strategies failed not simply because the governments ran out of reserves, but because they had failed to embrace a broader set of policy changes powerful enough to restore confidence in future stability and growth. It is worth emphasizing that the strategies ultimately adopted in each case were quite unorthodox and were certainly not uniform. Besides the novel approach adopted in terms of the scale and structure of financing and the degree of international cooperation in support of the programs, the policy packages were also notable in the degree of emphasis placed on, for example, financial-sector reform and improvements to disclosure. In each case, the reforms proposed were the result of careful analysis of the causes of the individual crises and a pragmatic assessment of what was needed to correct the conditions that had led to problems and to restore confidence. And in all cases, the strategy was continually modified and adjusted as conditions changed and as the principals responsible developed a better feel for what was working and what was not. Conclusion Recovery in the Asian crisis countries took time, but it was stronger and more rapid than had been typical in other emerging market financial crises. Barely 18 months after the crisis, for example, Korean GDP had returned to pre-crisis levels, and this was true for all the Asian crisis countries by 2003. Growth has been relatively strong and stable since, though at a pace somewhat below the unsustainable rates of the decade prior to the crises.  The countries directly affected by the crises a decade ago are fundamentally stronger. The balance sheet weaknesses have been transformed into strength. Financial-sector reforms have been undertaken on a generally impressive scale. Stronger legal and institutional frameworks have helped create an environment in which enterprise is thriving. Macroeconomic policy has been reasonably prudent, and debt-to-GDP ratios are declining. Exchange rate regimes have become more flexible. These changes have made these economies far more resilient than they were a decade ago. They are much less likely to face the type of crisis, the acute, self-reinforcing panic produced by the balance sheet problems of that era. 4 BIS Review 69/2007 
Is there more to be done? Of course, but the challenge now is not so much the challenge of building stronger defenses against crisis, but rather the longer-term challenge of building a greater capacity to adapt to change in this increasingly integrated and rapidly evolving global economy. Thank you. BIS Review 69/2007 5 
Rakesh Mohan: Risk management in an open market economy Speech by Dr Rakesh Mohan, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the inaugural programme of the Centre for Advanced Financial Learning, Mumbai, 4 June 2007. Assistance of K. Damodaran and Himadri Bhattacharya in preparing the speech is gratefully acknowledged. *      *      * Peter L. Bernstein in his celebrated book Against the Gods writes, “The revolutionary idea that defines the boundary between modern times and the past is the mastery of risk: the notion that the future is more than a whim of the Gods and that men and women are not passive before nature. Until human beings discovered a way across that boundary, the future was a mirror of the past or the murky domain of oracles and soothsayers who held monopoly over knowledge of anticipated events” (Bernstein, 1996). Whereas risk management characterizes many of our activities in different spheres, from standard technological risk management embedded in almost all industrial goods and machinery, to worrying about climate change and global warming, it is in the world of finance that risk management is at the core of all its activities. With the generalized opening of trade and of capital movement across the world over the past decade and a half, risk management has become all pervasive across the whole financial sector. In a closed economy with administered prices, fixed or predictable exchange rates and interest rates, the micro perception of risk was relatively benign. In those conditions, in effect, it was the sovereign that undertook to do the risk management for the economy. As a consequence of the rigidity embedded in these systems, economic adjustments did not take place on a day-to-day gradual basis and risks effectively accumulated until discontinuous macroeconomic adjustments were forced on the system. Such discontinuous adjustments involved non-marginal adjustments in the exchange rate, interest rates, administered prices of basic goods, or in fiscal expenditures, and the like. The impact on individuals and market participants alike was usually relatively traumatic, and consequent economic and financial crises were common. Moreover, such systems were likely to suffer from misallocation of resources, bouts of price instability and consequential low and uncertain economic growth. The notion that individual economic agents are ill-equipped to be exposed to exchange rate, interest rate and price risks, and that the sovereign alone should bear these risks is no longer regarded as tenable. It is now recognized that a system that allows for daily market adjustment of such prices operates more smoothly and that wider dispersion of risks among economic agents is more conducive to the maintenance of economic and financial stability. However, the issue of how economic risks are to be dispersed among the sovereign, financial intermediaries, large corporations, small businesses, farmers and households and other categories of economic agents is still a live one. It is generally acknowledged in this regard that there has to be some correspondence between the incidence of risk and different agents' capacity to bear it.  Lacklustre macroeconomic performance of command economies in the 1970s and in the following decades resulted in a shift in the thinking on risk, leading to the realization that it is far more efficient to allow individual economic agents to face, transfer and manage risks through a market mechanism. The collapse of the Bretton Woods System in 1971 ushered in an era of `generalized floating' of the exchange rates of major currencies. The gradual deregulation, relaxation/abolition of capital controls and globalization that followed the collapse of the Soviet system provided the backdrop as also the incentive for the risk management concepts and practices to emerge and evolve. The distinguishing feature of the new paradigm is that it does not mean that all risks should be eliminated by way of insurance-like products that have been known to mankind for a long time. The key is pricing of risks in markets for risk products. Development of deep and liquid markets in risk products – both cash as well derivatives – which were boosted by phenomenal progress in quantitative finance made it possible for risk management as a discipline and profession to come of age. However, this way of looking at risk management does not mean at all that there is no role for the sovereign or for regulators in financial markets. Profound changes have also taken place in the economic and financial landscape in India over the last two decades or so, marked by wide-ranging reforms in both the real and financial sectors. Adoption of a unified and market-determined exchange rate for the rupee in early 1993, followed by current account convertibility in 1994, enactment of a new foreign exchange law in 1999, and significant BIS Review 69/2007 1 
though gradual capital account liberalization over the last decade have led to a manifold increase in the volumes of both current and capital account transactions between India and the rest of the world. At the same time, deregulation of interest rates, greater use of indirect instruments for monetary policy, reduction in statutory preemption on the resources of banks have paved the way for emergence of liquid markets for short- and long-term interest rates in India. The upshot of all these developments is that while resource allocation & use have become more efficient leading to higher growth impulses, with economic agents now having more choices to make and competition to face, there are more risks to contend with as well on a daily basis. In other words, increased opportunities for economic agents are now accompanied by new types of risks to be managed as well. The broad trends marking the present and the foreseeable future are clear. Economic and financial engagement with the rest of the world will further expand in several dimensions. Viewed from this perspective, economic agents in India should be able to walk in step with their counterparts and competitors elsewhere. One essential requirement in this regard is that risk management systems and procedures as well as the market for risk management products in India should be world class. As we introduce new risk management systems, upgrade existing ones and develop new markets for risk management products, it is very important for us to keep in mind the objective conditions that exist in India. We will need to continually keep in view the differential risk-bearing capacities among different economic agents in the country. Even among different financial intermediaries, let alone households and farmers, we have the coexistence of small and widely dispersed entities, such as primary agriculture credit societies (PACSs), rural and urban cooperative banks, public sector banks, new private sector banks, and foreign banks, with each having different degrees of sophistication related to risk management. Hence, our approach to the introduction of modern risk management instruments and systems in the country has, per force, to be cognizant of our own requirements and capacity. Risk management in financial intermediaries and real sector entities The broad principles governing risk management are the same for entities in both the real and financial sectors. However, risk management in banks and other financial intermediaries acquires added importance because of their three distinguishing characteristics: (i) they are much more leveraged; (ii) they hold public money; and (iii) payments systems operate through banks.  In general, banks are exposed to much more credit and interest rate risk, while the real sector entities, particularly those which are engaged in international trade and commodity manufacturing, processing or trade are more exposed to exchange rate and commodity price risks. But the commodity price risk that borrowers are exposed to gets translated into credit risk for their lenders. Risk management for banks and financial institutions is critically important because they are “risk engines”; they take risks, they transform them and they embed them in their products and services. There are powerful motives for banks to implement risk-based practices; to provide a balanced view of risk and return from a management point of view, to develop competitive advantages and to comply with regulatory requirements.  As is the case globally, banks in India have a very special role to play in promoting better risk management standards and practices. Being the chief repositories of credit risk, the quality of their loan assets depends critically on how effective the risk management policies, processes and procedures of their borrowers are. Among their borrowing clients themselves, there would be differentiated risk-bearing expertise and hence banks are expected to provide professional advice to their clients on risk management. Thus, banks have good business reasons for acquiring specialization and professional expertise in risk management. This would, however, be possible only if banks themselves are good managers of their own risks. There is another related issue, albeit a slightly deeper one. In contrast to the capital market, banks are privy to much more wide and rich information in respect of their clients. While the comparative advantage of banks in intermediating financial resources hinges on their being able to enjoy economies of scale and scope in acquiring and processing information in the first place, a relevant issue in this context is whether this information is being put to optimal use for managing risks, both at the level of individual banks and also at the aggregate level. Although it is early days to assess the effectiveness of the institutional mechanism provided by credit information bureaus for the pooling of 2 BIS Review 69/2007 
critical borrower information for common use within certain important safeguards, the importance of more intensive and extensive use of information hardly needs to be overemphasized.  Further, as the economy grows and new types of activities and enterprises appear on the scene, it would be an imperative for banks to be able to assess the risks associated with such activities and enterprises. As is the case elsewhere, this will also critically depend on collection and analysis of all relevant information. Business approach to risk management Risk management is an integral part of the overall business planning and management and not something on the fringes or “add on”. When RBI introduced the Asset Liability Management (ALM) framework in 1999, it was viewed by some banks initially as an exercise for finding out maturity mismatches or re-pricing mismatches. It was only when banks began compiling ALM statements that they realized the benefits of pursuing pro-active asset liability management themselves. In the context of transition to Basel II framework in India and elsewhere, where the focus is significantly on risk management, there is a perception among some banks that this is merely adding to their compliance costs: hence, they tend to view it as a compliance issue. Basel II attempts to promote more advanced risk management systems, align regulatory capital closer to economic capital and thus promote greater efficiency in the use of capital. It is evident from the experience of the last few years, which have witnessed gyrations in exchange rate and interest rates that banks with better risk management policies and systems are more resilient to shocks and volatilities, thereby creating value for their various stakeholders. Basel II offers an opportunity to banks to become more efficient, which fact should be accorded more importance than the regulatory requirement.  Whether risk management is at the centrestage or on the sidelines of business operations of banks is revealed in the pricing of various types of risks. Currently, the interest rate charged by banks in India on various types of loans and advances varies within an unusually wide range, say, between 6 per cent and 16 per cent, and even higher in some cases. Visiting bankers tell me that such a range is much wider than is observed in other markets. If this is true, is it the case that variance in risk is much higher among Indian borrowers relative to those in other countries? Or is it that our banks' risk appraisal techniques are faulty and that they end up magnifying the true variance in risk? Or is it the case that the pricing of credit is not scientifically linked to risk, leading to anomalies, such as cross subsidization in the credit market? It could also be that the proportionate cost of credit appraisal varies inversely with the size of loan, and banks substitute a high credit price for the cost of credit appraisal. In this context, the introduction of credit information bureaus, referred to earlier may be expected to make a material difference in credit appraisal practices. Mis-pricing of credit risk is an issue, which apart from introducing systemic vulnerability, has welfare implications for small borrowers. Banks have access to all relevant credit information on the borrowers/ potential borrowers and they are well positioned to use this to their advantage while discriminating between various grades of risk. Moreover, banks are well equipped today to re-orient their rating processes to assess the line of activity of the counterparty, in addition to the conventional assessment of the counterparty. It needs to be emphasized in the context of Basel II that no amount of capital can make a financial institution absolutely secure. The key issue is proper pricing of risks. If a purely compliance attitude is taken in respect of risk management and capital adequacy, there is a danger that it may lead to “seat belt law” banking. As the experience showed in many countries with mandatory use of seat belts, it became apparent soon that drivers were prepared to take more risks, believing themselves to be safer. Proper management of risks is the key. Risk management should be integrated with the activity of risk taking – one need to structure one’s position according to the risks understood by him or her. Risks that are not understood well should be avoided.  Stress testing The corollary to increased risk related to the expectation of greater fluctuation in prices, exchange rates, and interest rates, is the need for developing regular systems for stress testing. In fact, the antidote to excessive complacency resulting from greater risk-related capital adequacy is the use and consciousness of regular stress testing.  Globally, stress testing is becoming an integral part of banks’ risk management systems and is used to evaluate their potential vulnerability to certain unlikely but plausible events or movements in financial variables. In the above background, the need for banks in India to adopt “stress tests” as a risk BIS Review 69/2007 3 
management tool has been emphasised in the Annual Policy Statement announced by the Governor in April 2006. The draft guidelines that were issued in this regard are now being given a final shape on the basis of the feedback that has been received from market participants. An efficient stress test framework is necessary to incorporate a forward looking element in banks’ business strategies. Banks would do well to approach stress testing not merely as a regulatory requirement but as an integral part of their risk management processes and Basel II implementation. The stress test results need to be suitably integrated into the risk management processes, business strategies and capital planning.  Just as stress testing is important at the enterprise level, we need to upgrade our stress testing procedures at the systemic level as well. In the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis, and in the context of the increased discussion on global financial architecture, the World Bank and the IMF introduced a new procedure for “Financial System Assessment Programmes” (FSAPs). India was one of the first countries to volunteer for this programme in 1999. We are now engaged in an update of that exercise, which we are doing ourselves so that such assessment programmes get internalized within the system. Such a programme also helps in coordinating approaches and thinking between the government and all the financial sector regulators. Operational risk management Operational risk is assumed during the normal course of business along with other major risks viz. credit risk or market risk, and is not normally assumed independently on a risk-return basis. Operational risk management is particularly relevant to banks, because although they are able to either transfer or hedge a portion of their other major risks viz. credit and market risk exposures, operational risk cannot be hedged or transferred. Further, banks are increasingly undertaking transaction processing, asset management services, cash management services, and sale of sophisticated financial products which are generating a fair amount of revenue. Banks have also begun using models for managing their credit and market risks and this exposes them to model risks. Banks increasingly use computers and IT for a larger segment of their operations, including certain critical operations, and this exposes them to a significant degree of operational risk. Further, banks are exposed to reputational risk to a considerable extent which has not yet been formally taken on board and addressed as a risk element in many banks. Since operational risk has changed its complexion due to the above factors, banks need to take a comprehensive view in this regard to have a wholesome picture of their exposure to operational risk.  Traditionally, some aspects of operational risks have been sought be minimized through internal inspection and audit. However, there is a need to recast and modernize this function so as to transform it into a mechanism designed to operate on the whole suite of operational risk events.  The issue of operational risk has assumed higher importance worldwide in recent years with the increased prevalence of outsourcing, particularly overseas. With India being a major recipient of such outsourcing, this issue assumes even greater importance for us. Banks and other financial intermediaries have to understand that operational risk management in their outsourced operations is their own responsibility. This issue has also given rise to a good deal of discussion among financial regulators: to what extent should they be examining risk management procedures in outsourced entities or how can they assess the risk management procedures in the regulated entities as they relate to their service providers? Risk management and the use of financial derivatives The implication of the huge expansion in the use of financial derivatives that has taken place over the past five years is attracting increasing discussion among financial sector regulators. How do we assess their impact on financial stability and systemic risk? The most succinct and lucid discussion of this general issue that I have come across is in a brief speech given just 2 weeks back by my US counterpart, Donald Kohn of the Federal Reserve Bank. As he puts it very eloquently, “….. (t)he securitization of mortgages and other assets has been transforming regulated depository institutions from holders of interest rate risk and credit risk to originators and distributors of such risk” (Kohn, 2007) What is the situation in India in respect of financial derivatives?  4 BIS Review 69/2007 
Use of financial derivatives in India  A liquid market for forward foreign exchange contracts has existed in India for several decades now. This product is still the main instrument for hedging foreign exchange risk in India, although foreign currency options are also getting increasingly popular. Over the last 10 years or so, several other types of derivatives have begun trading in India. As you are aware, efforts are on for introduction of credit derivatives in India. Feasibility probes for foreign exchange futures have begun. Efforts are also on for an appropriate design for interest rate futures. In the recent years, the regulatory ecosystem for financial derivatives has been sought to be made more effective and straightforward. Insertion of a new Chapter IIID to the RBI Act, 1934 by way of an amendment in 2006 has been a milestone in this regard, since this has provided legal clarity as regards OTC derivatives and has also defined regulatory domain and scope. Accounting treatment of financial derivatives in banks is also being streamlined so as to be broadly in tune with international standards.  What are the issues that we need to be concerned about as the use of financial derivatives increases in India? We need to understand that, as reflected Donald Kohn's remark that I have just quoted, we will witness a significant change in the function of financial sector intermediaries over time, as the use of financial derivatives gathers force. We will need to prepare ourselves for these changes from the regulatory point of view as will the financial intermediaries themselves in their internal risk operations. As has been the case in some developed markets, with growth in securitization and expansion of credit derivatives, if banks which are now the storehouse of credit risks are to significantly abandon this space, what implication could this have for financial stability.  With more distribution of risk we will need to address the issue of where will the risks rest. We will also need to assess the capability of market participants who will ultimately bear the risks. Will they be such that regulators do not need to regulate them? Will financial regulators even need to know where the risks are distributed? One view is that as long as the participants in this market are large institutional investors, or high net worth individuals, they will need no protection. Let the risks be distributed among those who wish to take such risk, and let it be distributed according to their capacity as determined by the market itself. Hence, there is no need for any safety net like the one that is implicitly embedded in the lender of last resort role of central banks. What will be important in such markets is the availability of adequate market liquidity at all times for them to operate efficiently, enabling market participants to take and liquidate positions as necessary. The job for regulators would then be to ensure that there is adequate depth in the markets, that clearing and settlement systems are efficient and safe, that there are no dominant market players who can move markets, and that the players are themselves large and sophisticated. In times of market stress, the only issue would be the availability of adequate liquidity. Given that the extraordinary growth of credit and other financial derivatives is still a relatively new phenomenon, and that this has happened in the context of accommodative monetary policies in G3 countries in recent years, it is too early to assess how such markets will work in times of stress and what the overall regulatory approach should then be. One positive side of this assessment is that, unlike the 1980s and 1990s, when financial crises were frequent in developing and developed countries alike, the past decade has been remarkably free of such crises, worldwide. High oil prices, large business failures, large stock market fluctuations that have been witnessed in this period have not resulted in financial crises, or disruptive effects on financial intermediaries. This is attributed to the wider dispersion of risk by some, whereas others point to the overall benign macroeconomic and healthy global growth conditions that have prevailed over this period. What is my take on these international developments and their implications for India? I don't have a clear answer. We need to embrace these financial developments in such a way that we continue to ensure financial stability, and that we enable domestic market participants, both financial and non-financial, to increasingly deal with the kind of risks that are emerging with greater market liberalization both at home and abroad.  As a monetary authority and financial sector regulator, we will need to enhance our own risk management capacity, both for our internal purposes, but also as evaluators of the risk management capacity of regulated entities. We will continuously endeavour to enhance the risk management skills and capabilities of market participants and improve the micro-infrastructure of markets so that financial stability is maintained. Meanwhile, we will need to keep in mind the very varied nature of our economy that I had alluded to earlier.  BIS Review 69/2007 5 
The key to our approach to the development of financial derivatives in India has to be a proactive stance for the adoption of robust risk management systems within the relevant financial intermediaries and, from our point of view, particularly in banks. We have to ensure that the introduction of new risk instruments actually increases the risk management capabilities of the system as a whole, and not the other way round because of inadequate preparation. Reflections on risk management at RBI The Reserve Bank of India, like all other central banks is also a financial institution that is exposed to a variety of risks. Over the last several years, there has been a structural transformation of the risk exposure of the RBI in that as against pre-dominantly rupee-denominated assets figuring on its balance sheet, it now has an overwhelming proportion of assets denominated in major foreign currencies. This transformation means more volatility in its asset valuation in rupee terms as also in the current earnings in rupee terms. It needs to be emphasized that while a bank or a corporate in any country can choose to eliminate foreign currency risk, a central bank like the RBI, which does not have any liability in foreign exchange, cannot hedge exchange rate risk beyond a very modest extent. The approach followed by the RBI in this regard for a very long time has been to have a diversified portfolio of reserves, both in terms of currencies and instruments and a strong level of capitalization. The RBI has also been very transparent in disclosing its risk management policies in annual reports and also in half-yearly reports of reserves management since January 2005.  In addition to the issues related to market risk management of our assets and, hence, the integrity of our balance sheet, which is so essential for the financial system as a whole, we have to deal increasingly with the issues of operational risk that I had outlined earlier. As the institution responsible for the payment and settlement system we are giving increased attention to all our own IT systems, back up, alternative sites, and the like. Limits of risk management Adoption of risk management policies and practices by economic entities in the sense that they assume risk by choice and not by chance is value enhancing. However, hedging through market instruments results in a redistribution of risks. Ideally, if this redistribution is done on the basis of a scientific appraisal of the optimal level and combination of risks for each entity it may result in an overall reduction of risks at the macro level. But the economy as a whole would still be exposed to risks. Also, for proper functioning of hedging products it is essential that expectations about the risk variable should be heterogeneous. If price movements are unidirectional for a long time, protection sellers demand large premium from protection buyers.  Apart from the above, there are more subtle issues concerning risk management. It is well-known that markets flagrantly violate some of the postulates and assumptions of traditional mathematical finance. The volatility of financial prices and the tendency of this volatility to occur sometimes in episodes generally unrelated to any clearly exogenous news about fundamentals has been a subject of research for a long time in behavioural finance. The behavioral dimensions of risk management and hedging have attracted much attention in the recent years among academics and researchers. Among other things, hedging decisions of any entity are influenced by two important factors: (a) stance of the competitors in this regard; and (b) anomalies of human behaviour. The latter-mentioned aspect is significant: most often entities do not always have the intellectual or emotional impulse to take on risks and deal with them before they impinge on performance and it is too late. Many do not feel the same way when they buy a luxury car and when they buy insurance for the same car. When we are educated to risk management possibilities, we become aware of the rich potential that finance has for improving human welfare, but we do not find it emotionally easy always to take advantage of this potential. Experienced traders know it too well how difficult it is at times to quit a loss-making position. The field of risk management needs to design its methods to minimize the human weakness in risk management.  Finally, have adoption of risk management and use of risk mitigation products made the financial markets a safer place than before? It is a tough call to take. In a recent interview, Professor Robert Merton, who along with Myron Scholes and Fischer Black invented the famous option pricing formula in the early 1970s, reportedly said, “The real story is not what happened to LTCM in 1998 but what 6 BIS Review 69/2007 
happened to Amaranth later – or rather what did not happen….institutions have adjusted and we have learnt to deal with some of these crises which are not crises any more” (Tett, 2007).

Jean-Claude Trichet: The role of central banks in a globalised economy Speech by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, on the occasion of the 13th Conférence de Montréal, Montreal, 18 June 2007. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen, Thank you for inviting me to the 13th Conference of Montreal hosted by the International Economic Forum of the Americas. I am delighted to speak today before such a distinguished audience. I greatly appreciate your objective to organise wide-ranging and open discussions on major international economic issues. The theme of this year’s conference – Succeeding through uncertainty: from risk evaluation to strategic decisions – is a very timely and challenging one. We at the European Central Bank often have to navigate uncertainties and find that our monetary policy strategy is of great help in setting the course.  One of the themes most discussed in the conference programme is globalisation, and rightly so given its huge importance. I would like to investigate with you the role of central banks in a globalised economy. First, I will outline some of the features of the debate. Second, I will reflect on the integration of the euro area within the globalised economy. Third, I will reflect on some of the implications of globalisation for central banks.  1.  Globalisation and some of its underlying trends Globalisation encompasses several phenomena and trends which have led to a growing interdependence of most economies throughout the world. It displays its effects through a strong increase in cross-border transactions in goods and services, capital, labour and natural resources. I would add that, at the same time, we are witnessing a substantial increase in the cross-border exchanges of ideas and concepts between the various institutions, organisations and non-trading companies. The concept of globalisation has been of vital importance over the last 20 years – and has been even more so in the last ten years – thanks to a combination of factors, including the diffusion of ever more sophisticated and affordable information and communication technologies. The cost of shipping goods has fallen. Economies have continued to open up and many trade and financial barriers have been lifted. National barriers to the circulation of goods, services and production factors are diminishing everywhere. Foreign direct investment (FDI) flows have also surged, leading to an internationalisation of production processes and new ways of doing business as companies have established affiliates abroad both to gain access to foreign markets and to reduce input costs.  Globalisation has allowed many emerging countries to enter and compete in world markets. In order to measure the phenomenon on a global scale, it should be noted that the labour force available for participating in globalised markets has probably doubled from 1.5 billion to 3 billion with the opening-up of China, India, many formerly centrally planned economies and several other emerging countries. Although labour mobility is still limited worldwide, the increased flexibility of capital flows implies that firms now have much easier access to global labour supply than before. As a result, many industries have set up supply chains on a global scale.  Let me now provide you with some figures to document the magnitude and scope of globalisation. Global trade openness – measured as world exports and imports of goods and services as a share of world GDP – has practically doubled over the last 20 years, from 33.9% of world GDP in 1986 to 60% of world GDP in 2006. An increasingly decisive factor has been the increase in trade in intermediate goods and services as a result of the rising internationalisation of production processes.  Financial systems have also been deeply affected. As investors’ incentives to hold foreign assets in their portfolios and the possibilities to diversify and spread financial risks globally have grown, this has affected all facets of financial systems, be it markets, infrastructures or institutions.  Let me briefly illustrate some impressive developments. The share of gross international asset holdings in world GDP – which provides a measure of financial openness – has shown an eightfold increase over the last 25 years and now stands at more than 130% of world GDP. As far as global capital flows are concerned, it is noteworthy that their composition has changed significantly over BIS Review 68/2007 1 
recent years. While FDI and international equity flows were dominant in the late 1990s, international transactions in mainly liquid assets have risen in recent years, making up most of the increase in global capital movements. International risk-sharing and the transfer of net savings across countries are important features of this process.  Emerging market economies are gaining a larger share of global GDP. Aggregated data show that they posted net private capital flows of USD 650 billion in 2006 compared with USD 458 billion in 2005. Net direct investments remained globally unchanged over this period, with net inflows of USD 267 billion in 2006. Portfolio investments, on the other hand, which include the public sector, recorded higher outflows in 2006 of USD 379 billion, compared with USD 258 billion in 2005, while portfolio investments to emerging market economies decreased slightly. On the whole, emerging market economies have most recently been providing the rest of the world with net resources corresponding to their current account surpluses. The main drivers are limited domestic absorptive capacities and underdeveloped domestic financial systems.  Globalisation is fostering economic prosperity and raising living standards through various channels. There is stronger international competition and a greater transfer of technology and knowledge. This is promoting productivity gains and global economic growth. Higher efficiencies are helping to lower both costs for firms and prices of tradables. The availability of new product varieties is increasing. Resources are allocated to the most profitable activities across the world, and there are new possibilities to diversify and share risks globally. Also, scrutiny by international investors serves as a disciplining device, which enhances the quality of domestic economic policies and thus contributes to improved economic fundamentals.  However, globalisation also presents some challenges and poses some risks. The ever closer global integration and the surge in capital mobility have rendered the international financial system more exposed to changes in investor sentiment. Furthermore, international trade and financial links might intensify the transmission of shocks from one country to another and amplify cross-border spillover. We should not forget that, a few years ago, a number of financial crises posed a major threat to the international financial system, including the Asian crisis starting in 1997 and the Russian crisis in 1998. Each of these crises was different and the international community managed to resolve them successfully. Each crisis illustrated the need for adequate investment in institutions and human capital to strengthen economic governance. I will come back to the impact of major financial crises for central banks in my third reflection. Past crises illustrate the vulnerability of the global economic and financial system and remind us of the importance of always being alert and never being complacent.  2.  The integration of the euro area within a globalised economy  My second reflection is about the economic and financial links between the euro area and the rest of the world. I will argue that integration within Europe has gone hand-in-hand with the integration of Europe within the global economy. In trade terms, for example, the euro area is very open vis-à-vis the rest of the world; more open than the United States and Japan. Extra-euro area exports of goods and services account for around 20% of euro area GDP, roughly the same share as extra-euro area imports. This is substantially higher than in the United States, where exports of goods and services represent about 10% of GDP and imports 16%, as well as in Japan, where total exports amount to 15% of GDP and imports 13.4%. Moreover, particularly noteworthy for the euro area is that the increase in trade with the rest of the world has been even greater than the increase in exchanges within the euro area. What is even more remarkable, perhaps, is that the euro area is more financially open than the United States and Japan. Let me present four observations. The first observation is that the external assets and liabilities of the euro area, as a percentage of GDP, are very large and account for around 124% and 137%, respectively. By comparison, in the United States, the corresponding figures are substantially lower: 90% of GDP for assets and 110% for liabilities. In Japan, foreign financial assets are likewise significantly lower than in the euro area (94% of GDP in 2005), and the difference is even greater for liabilities, which represent only 60% of GDP, i.e. less than half of the corresponding figure for the euro area. This highlights how the euro area is very outward-looking. My second observation is that the euro has very probably contributed to the financial opening of the euro area. On the assets side, stocks of euro area assets held abroad increased from less than 87% of GDP in 1999 to, as mentioned, over 124% in 2005. On the liabilities side, the increase was also very substantial, from around 92% to 137%. The rise has actually been much less pronounced for the 2 BIS Review 68/2007 
United States: US assets have grown from 80% of GDP in 1999 to 90% today, and US liabilities have increased from 91% to 110% of GDP. In other words, the euro area has witnessed a more substantial increase since the start of Economic and Monetary Union. My third observation is that the euro area is an attractive place for FDI. A breakdown reveals that inward FDI amounts to more than 27% of euro area GDP, against 22.5% for the United States. The euro area seems to have received, proportionally to GDP, a similar amount of FDI as China – 27.3% for both economies – according to IMF statistics. In net terms, the stock of direct investment abroad is only slightly higher than that of FDI within the euro area (30.4% against 27.3%, respectively).  My fourth observation concerns bilateral FDI linkages of the euro area. Based on available data, it is worth noting that the stock of euro area FDI abroad is mostly held with mature economies: nearly 21% in the United States, 24% in the United Kingdom, 9% in Switzerland, and between 2.5% and 3% in Sweden, Canada and Japan. Likewise, on the liabilities side, the United Kingdom and the United States account for a larger share than on the assets side (nearly 40% and 23.5%, respectively). I should also stress that the amount of euro area FDI in emerging market economies rose quickly. Between 1999 and 2005, outward FDI from the euro area to the so-called BRIC group – which includes Brazil, Russia, India and China – increased markedly. Over this period, the stock of outward FDI in the BRIC group rose from €63 billion to €133 billion (or by 111%). In comparison, the stock of euro area FDI in the United States increased by 55%, from €360 billion to €558 billion, during the same period.  The euro area itself has also become more attractive as a destination for FDI from the BRIC countries: between 1999 and 2005, FDI stocks from the BRIC group in the euro area tripled, from €4 billion to €12 billion. This is still low in comparative terms but is not insignificant. In terms of comparison, the figures for US FDI stocks in the euro area rose from €322 billion to €560 billion over the same period. Brazilian and Russian firms account for the bulk of the BRIC countries’ FDI surge in the euro area, but Chinese and Indian FDI has picked up in recent years.  On the whole, this evidence suggests that there is no “fortress Europe” or “fortress euro area”  3.  The implications of globalisation for central banks  My third reflection is about the implications of globalisation for central banks in their two principal functions, i.e. setting monetary policy and helping to secure financial stability.  Globalisation and monetary policy. The issue of the impact that we have observed for some months of the historic episode of accelerated globalisation on inflation is both important and much debated. Economic theory has numerous channels through which globalisation can influence the level of prices, but these influences are not one-directional. I have already mentioned the basic phenomenon of the increase in the pool of labour available to the world economy with the widespread opening-up of emerging economies and the former centrally planned economies. The phenomenon exerts pressure, in particular, at the slightest rise in the cost of labour, especially unskilled labour. In a more general manner, it tends to modify significantly the previous balance between capital and labour at the global level. Globalisation also exerts pressure conducive to price stability by strengthening global competition, by reducing the ability of firms to fix prices and by exerting pressure on unit production costs in the industrialised countries.  A third influence, which is in keeping with my previous two points, is that globalisation has also exerted a positive effect on the productivity of the global productive sector by facilitating, and accelerating, the phenomenon of restructuring and optimisation of the division of labour in a wider cross-border context. But it would be naive to think that the effects of globalisation on inflation go in one direction only. Indeed, the sudden emergence of fast-growing economies in the global economy is exerting upward pressure on prices for mining products and fossil fuels. This phenomenon has been particularly visible since 2003. The same phenomenon of rising prices is observable in certain areas of agricultural production. The attainment of considerably higher living standards by a new and numerous middle class translates into major changes in eating habits and, as a result, in the meat, cereal and fresh produce sectors of the world economy. BIS Review 68/2007 3 
Since the theoretical influences that globalisation can be said to have on prices are numerous and work in different directions, it might perhaps be natural to suppose that globalisation, as a continuous phenomenon with medium-term effects, will translate into substantial changes in relative prices – the prices of manufactures falling and those of oil, gas and certain commodities rising – without the general level of prices being significantly affected. Empirical research does not allow this conjecture to be either irrefutably confirmed or disproved in the recent period. All in all, the available data indeed confirm that the prices of manufacturing imports in the euro area were at end-2006 still below their 2001 level. Although import prices for raw materials have risen strongly since 2003, it can be said that, over the same period, the acceleration in import prices overall, all products taken together, has been moderated by the growing proportion of euro area imports coming from countries with low production costs (countries in eastern Europe and Asia, particularly China). It remains that the phenomenon of globalisation and of its acceleration since the mid-1990s has coincided with a decline in global inflation and in its volatility. Concomitantly and as a consequence of this stabilisation of inflation at a low level, we have also seen lower volatility in macroeconomic variables. But it would be wrong to conclude that this correlation between globalisation and low inflation demonstrates a causal relationship. Indeed several other factors – independent of globalisation – can be identified as helping to explain these good results. I see at least four.  In the first place, the very rapid progress in science and technology, in particular information and communication technologies – leading to significant productivity gains which coincide with globalisation and, moreover, are one of its underlying causes. In the second place, structural reforms which have been introduced in the industrialised world from the beginning of the 1980s and which have gradually increased throughout these economies. These structural reforms, like the spread of technological progress, have helped to increase the growth potential of the economies and thus to facilitate price stability. In the third place, the greater budgetary discipline which has recently characterised most economies following the previous period of poor fiscal management. And finally, the monetary policy pursued by the central banks and their enhanced credibility. I would particularly like to stress the last point. Whatever the influences being exerted in the context of globalisation, the basic principle which allows the anchoring of monetary policy remains: in the long run, inflation is a monetary phenomenon. As a consequence, globalisation does not affect the central role and overriding responsibility of central banks to preserve price stability.  In the short term, the central bank must continue anchoring inflation expectations at a level that is consistent with the central bank’s definition of price stability. Let me illustrate this by means of an example. Let’s take the significant increase in energy prices over the last few years. I will assume that a central bank credibly commits to maintain stable prices and is fully and unequivocally trusted by the public and by other policy-makers. The corporate sector, which uses energy as an input for its production processes, observes a significant and sharp rise in the price of oil. Since there is a credible commitment to price stability over the medium term and inflation expectations are well anchored at low levels, entrepreneurs easily understand that it is the relative price of energy that is rising, while the aggregate price level may not increase as much. Therefore, their incentives to fully pass the increase in input prices to consumers are reduced because, if they did, their competitiveness could be significantly eroded, especially in an increasingly competitive global environment. Hence, in this example, the credibility of the central bank clearly reduces second-round inflationary effects and minimises macroeconomic fluctuations in output and inflation. Now let me turn to the role of central banks in mitigating risks to financial stability stemming from globalisation. Widespread interlinking of the financial systems has created a global financial system that it becoming a real, significant entity at the global level. This affects the financial stability assessment performed by central banks in two ways.  • The first way is that it calls for a growing global focus on their financial stability analysis. For instance, for the euro area, a complete and comprehensive view on the key sources of risk and vulnerabilities facing the financial system cannot be formed without taking due account of wide global imbalances or concerns about excess global liquidity.  4 BIS Review 68/2007 
• The second way is that it calls for enhanced cross-border cooperation and exchange of information among central banks (and between them and other authorities contributing to financial stability). This should produce a comprehensive picture of risks and vulnerabilities and identify appropriate and effective mitigating policy actions. In the European Union this goal is pursued mainly through the activity of the Economic and Financial Committee in its Financial Stability Table set-up, comprising representatives from ministries of finance, central banks and the supervisory committees in banking, securities and insurance, as well as the ESCB/Eurosystem. At the level of the G-10, this goal is pursued by the Financial Stability Forum and other sectoral committees.  The globalisation of financial systems also affects the role of central banks in the design of financial regulation and supervision. This role is played by central banks because they either have a direct supervisory responsibility or act in an advisory capacity to governments. In general, financial globalisation calls for an intensification of efforts among regulators on a cross-border basis to produce consistent regulatory and supervisory standards. The aim is to promote a level playing-field and reduce regulatory arbitrage. This is clearly illustrated by the experience of the European Union where the establishment of a single financial market is a main strategic objective and presupposes the removal of potential regulatory and supervisory barriers. The EU experience also shows the usefulness of proceeding in steps in the process of convergence by focusing first on regulatory requirements and subsequently on supervisory standards and practices. In this context, I would like to offer three considerations:  • First, in the areas clearly identified previously it is important that the regulators of the major financial systems deepen and strengthen their dialogue at the global level. Therefore, the initiative of the European Commission to extend its traditional regulatory dialogue with the United States to other major countries, including China and Japan, is supported in particular.  • Second, we see an increase in the number of new areas in which the need for a consistent approach at the global level is becoming apparent. Financial institutions with high leverage are a good example here. On the basis of the mandate given informally by the G8, the Financial Stability Forum has played and continues to play a crucial role in developing recommendations at the global level targeted at regulators, counterparties of the leverage funds and investors in these funds. The institutions themselves have been encouraged to develop, voluntarily and under their own responsibility, their principles of best practice (“benchmarks”), both in terms of transparency towards their counterparties and their own investors, and in terms of their optimal management of risks. Credit derivatives markets could also be mentioned as another area that requires a consistent approach at the global level. • Third, in general terms, there is a still a great deal of progress to be made in harmonising effective supervisory practices at the international level. This is particularly paradoxical regarding the banks, since the Basel Committee is the oldest and most advanced in terms of ensuring that uniform principles and concepts of prudential supervision are defined at the global level. However, given the diversity of practices, a significant harmonisation effort is still necessary and is currently being made by the Basel Committee’s Accord Implementation Group (AIG), which is mandated to work on practical implementation issues for achieving convergence of banking supervision practices at the international level. 4.  Conclusion I would like to conclude by drawing your particular attention to the following five points:  First, let us never forget that scientific and technological progress is very much at the root of globalisation. There would be no low-cost, instantaneous transmission of information, concepts and services at the global level without new information and communication technologies. There would be no extremely rapid expansion of international trade in goods without technological progress in sea and air transport. Second, if science and technology are at the root of the current globalisation, this could be a trend that not only lasts, but also strengthens. There is no indication that scientific and technological progress is tending to slow down. In fact, the opposite is the case. BIS Review 68/2007 5 
Third, the rapid growth that we are seeing at the global level, and highly significant transformations which are both the cause and effect of this growth at the level of each of the economies, rapid changes of the respective economic weightings of the various continents and of the structure of the global economy all combine as a consequence to make predictions based on past regularities less reliable. Consequently, uncertainty tends to increase and economic and financial risks with a weak or very weak probability, but a strong destabilising potential, appear as the inevitable, and in fact, “normal” counterpart to an unprecedented period of economic prosperity. Now is not a time to be complacent. Fourth, more than ever during a period of accelerated globalisation, central bank credibility is essential for anchoring solidly inflation expectations and for forming a solid base for monetary and financial stability in a brilliant, mobile international economy in which uncertainty and risks cannot be ignored.  Fifth and finally, it is crucial to deepen and strengthen global governance by exploiting to the full all possibilities offered by all formal and informal institutions that exist and by consolidating global financial stability, not only by unifying the principles and concepts of prudential supervision and regulation, but also by achieving real unification, resulting at the global level from the practical implementation of regulation and supervision.

Shamshad Akhtar: Islamic finance – emerging challenges of supervision Speech by Dr Shamshad Akhtar, Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, at the 4th Islamic Financial Services Board Summit, Dubai, 15 May 2007. *      *      * I. Background Diversification and structural transformation in financial sector has been accompanied by increasing integration among different segments of the financial sector. The traditional boundaries between banks and non-bank financial institutions are eroding and we are witnessing the growth of universal banking and/or mergers among different segments of sectors.  This trend has its benefits but has associated risks as well. Supervisors face a dual challenge. On one hand, supervisors are promoting financial diversification and consolidation to achieve market development and innovation. On the other hand, supervisors have to position themselves to recognize the new dimensions and types of risks and encourage appropriate risk mitigation. These considerations have triggered world wide debate on how to effectively supervise different segments of financial sector in conglomerate and universal structure.  So far these debates had been concentrated around conventional banking but now it is widely gripping the world of Islamic Finance (IF). Stronger inter-dependencies among different segments of IF are emerging largely because Islamic Financial Institutions (IFIs), in principle, have features and inherent characteristics and more compulsion, than conventional banking, to conform to universal banking or to evolve inter-linkages among different market segments.  II. Factors driving cross-sector linkages and interdependencies First and foremost, IFIs’ depositors/borrowers desire to conduct financial transactions that are Shariah compliant. It can be assumed that a person preferring to bank with an Islamic bank will also seek to use other faith-based financial services such as Takaful and Islamic mutual funds. This faith-driven feature in itself forces and incentivizes IFIs to offer, along side bank-based services (i.e. deposit and loans), a wide range of financial services. As a result, Islamic banks end up undertaking non-core banking activities such as fund management, capital market operations, securitization, leasing, and housing finance. This has enhanced the degree of integration between various segments of IF. For example: Islamic banks are likely to be strongly integrated with the Shariah capital markets since on credit portfolio side, Islamic banks do not have the same investment avenues as those available to their conventional counterparts. The outcome is that Islamic banks either end up taking large exposure in the capital markets directly or acquire subsidiaries which primarily engage in such businesses. Second differentiating aspect is the nature of contractual arrangements that drive deposits mobilized by conventional banks as compared to Islamic banks. Conventional bank deposits are interest based contracts with guaranteed interest return whereas Islamic banks raise deposit on a profit and loss sharing basis in either a Mudaraba or Musharaka structure. Mudaraba/Musharaka contracts transform the Islamic banks’ deposits into essentially a fund management product (although currently most regulators recognize these as equivalent to conventional deposit contracts) and this impacts the corresponding asset portfolio. There is a need therefore that Islamic banks acquire assets on a PLS basis as well and eventually move beyond fixed return products, like Murabaha and Ijara. This pushes an Islamic bank towards universal banking since in order to manage the portfolio profitability; it needs to invest across sectors in businesses based on Shariah principles, like equity and Sukuks in the capital market and trade contracts like commodity Murabaha, Musharaka, Ijara and Takaful.  Thirdly, further development of Islamic banking itself depends on concurrent development of Islamic capital market. For instance, development of Islamic debt market is key to the provision of adequate liquidity support while providing additional investment avenues. Likewise, Takaful development is critical to provide insurance coverage to Islamic banking products, like auto and consumer financing, while strengthening secondary capital and Islamic bond markets by being a major buyer of Islamic instruments. It is the confluence of these factors that have induced regulators to encourage and IFs to promote rapid and deeper financial inter-linkages and integration.  BIS Review 68/2007 1 
III. Supervisory challenges posed by cross-sector developments It is some of these above considerations that have augmented strategic alliances and linkages of various types among IFIs, both within country and cross borders. As such, IFIs are evolving either as part of a global financial concern or as a domestic bank acquiring or establishing subsidiaries and/or the two arms, i.e. Islamic and conventional banks coexist. Moreover, as the conventional parts of financial institutions move towards cross-sector integration, their Islamic counterparts (either as specialized window or as independent entities) will also follow eventually.  While it has by now been well established that there are significant benefits of enhanced integration and inter-linkages or conglomeration in IF, such as the economies of scale, operational synergies and effective use of scarce human resource, there are definitely certain risks.1 In this area, I would like to offer few basic observations. Firstly, it is inevitable that enhanced exposure of Islamic banks into capital markets exposes them to the volatility in associated businesses. Likewise, conglomeration, whether through universal banking or through parent subsidiary model,2 exposes them to a variety of issues such as contagion risk, regulatory arbitrage, high group exposures, conflict of interest etc. These risks apply equally to both Islamic and conventional modes of finance. However, Islamic banks have thus far not erected firewalls, like conventional banks, to separate legally, financially and managerially their investment and commercial banking activities. Obviously these risks pose a challenge to the supervisors and necessitate that appropriate changes be made in the supervisory regime.  Secondly, Shariah compliance issues necessitate taking a more aligned view across IF businesses as user of Islamic products may be oblivious of ideological differences as well as varying perceptions and interpretation of the Shariah advisors or boards and/or by regulators. Since institutions being supervised by one regulatory authority may be offering products of institutions being supervised by a different regulatory body, this could introduce complications and the challenge of ensuring uniform Shariah compliance across financial institutions and products.  Thirdly, traditionally different segments have been regulated by their specialized supervisory authorities. These authorities have adopted risk management principles and supervisory stances which are strictly in line with the risk profile of supervised sectors in isolation. With sector integration, supervisors have to coordinate closely in policy formulation and regulation as well as on-site supervision. They have to coordinate creation of necessary firewalls, remove moral hazards and govern the degree of cross segment exposure. This may even call for institutional restructuring through merging various supervisory bodies into a single entity or for closer coordination between supervisors through creation of a third coordinating body. IV. Sector inter-linkages of Pakistan’s Islamic finance system In Pakistan, besides offering trade loans, like Murabaha, Islamic banks are offering equity and quasi equity products, such as Musharaka and diminishing Musharaka, and investment banking activities such as loan syndication, structured finance, etc. The six full fledged Islamic banks with a network of 108 branches and another 58 stand alone Islamic branches of 13 conventional banks have registered phenomenal growth and as of April 2007, the Islamic banking sector constituted 3.3% of total banking assets.3 In view of the equity based nature of Islamic banking and lack of Shariah compliant financial instruments, central bank has allowed Islamic banks a relatively higher exposure (35% direct and 10% future of their equity) in capital markets compared to conventional banks (20% direct and 10% future). In addition, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has relaxed statutory reserve requirement (SLR) for Islamic banks at 8% versus industry norm of 18%.                                                        1  Financial Sector Regulation: Issues and Gaps, IMF 2004. 2  Universal Banks: First structure is of universal bank, in which all financial operations are conducted within a single corporate entity. The second model is the parent-subsidiary or operating subsidiary model, in which operations are conducted in and regulated as subsidiaries of another financial institution, usually (but not necessarily) a bank. Finally, in a holding company model activities are conducted in legally distinct entities, each with separate management and capital but all owned by a single financial or sometimes (unregulated) non-financial institution. 3  See Annex A for details on product wise share and bank. 2 BIS Review 68/2007 
Furthermore, Islamic banks are allowed to nurture parent-subsidiary/affiliate model whereby Islamic banks are by and large setting up asset management companies, brokerage firms and, now, Takaful businesses. Thus far the supervision of IFIs is bifurcated, with Islamic banks being regulated by SBP and non-bank IFIs, namely, Modarabas, Islamic mutual funds, Takaful companies and securities operations under the regulatory oversight of Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP).  Sector specific supervisory approach is also characterized by varying regulatory requirements vis-à-vis operational matters, governance framework and Shariah compliance across the range of IFIs. The differences extend to minimum capital requirements ranging from Rs6 billion for Islamic banks (by the year 2009), Rs500 million for family Takaful operators (by the year 2011), Rs300 million for general Takaful operators (by the year 2011) and Rs30 million for Islamic fund managers to Rs2.5 million for Modaraba management companies. The low capital base of financial institutions, engaged in the business of Takaful or fund management, poses a significant risk to the solvency of financial conglomerates that characterize the Islamic financial markets. In terms of financial reporting, Takaful companies are not required to circulate quarterly accounts among shareholders whereas all other Islamic financial institutions are required to do so in terms of the legal and regulatory framework.  The segregated supervisory approach has resulted in carving of legal framework specific to each sector for both conventional banks and IFIs4 but eventually there is a need for addressing the idiosyncratic nature of IF industry, products and market players. Moreover, with regard to IF, both the regulators are following different approaches towards Shariah compliance in the institutions regulated by them. SBP requires Islamic banks to appoint Shariah advisors according to a prescribed fit and proper criteria and a Shariah Board has been constituted at the level of SBP to deal with issues relating to Shariah interpretation and compliance among Islamic banks. SECP’s approach varies across different segments of IF. A Religious Board, constituted by the government, is responsible for approving the prospectus of each Modaraba containing the types of business to be conducted, management, etc. While the Religious Board has a significant role, there is no requirement for Modarabas or their management companies to appoint Shariah advisers at individual fund level. Islamic mutual funds and Takaful operators, on the other hand, are required to appoint Shariah Council/Boards but no explicit fit and proper criteria has been laid down by SECP in this regard. SECP is also authorized to appoint a Central Shariah Board under the Takaful Rules, 2005, which has not been established as yet.  The greatest challenge resulting from different Shariah compliance practices followed by Islamic banks, Modarabas, Takaful companies, etc. is the reputational risk faced by IFIs and misperceptions in the minds of public about Shariah compliance. This issue, therefore, needs to be addressed through coordination amongst the supervisors.  Another issue arises from overlapping supervisory jurisdiction. The Banking Company Ordinance allows banks to act as Modaraba management companies for floatation of Modarabas. In terms of Modaraba Companies Ordinance, Modarabas can be formed to conduct any type of business, which is permitted under Shariah, be it trading, manufacturing, airline, financing, leasing, services, etc. and these are regulated by SECP. Due to overlapping regulatory jurisdictions, banks are floating modarabas through separate subsidiaries,5 resulting in higher administrative, set up and regulatory costs. For sometime (from 1991-1997), these Modarabas were under the regulatory control of SBP, but the powers relating to licensing, winding up, etc. were retained by SECP; consequently the regulatory authority has been reverted to SECP. Again, this highlights the need for cross sector regulation of IFIs. Eventually there is a need to develop mechanisms for oversight of financial sector in an integrated manner. Besides coordination and cooperation among regulators, there is a need for consolidated supervision framework for financial institutions, guidelines for consolidated public financial statements and application of regulatory prudential limits on group wide basis and coordination to examine the intra group linkages with industrial and commercial entities. While conventional and Islamic financial industry would have to adopt similar approaches to integrated supervision, it has to be recognized that                                                       4  Fund management, as used here, refers to management of Islamic mutual funds and Modarabas. 5  A number of banks have formed subsidiaries and floated modarabas like NBP, HBL, ABL, Habib Metropolitan Bank, etc. No Islamic bank has yet floated a Modaraba. BIS Review 68/2007 3 
the latter is a relatively nascent industry and hence the targets should be modified to match the ground realities. V. Conclusion IFSB’s ten year roadmap has highlighted the cross sector nature of IFIs and the resultant need for supervision to evolve accordingly. It is in recognition of these factors that IFSB has sought to broaden its membership to securities and insurance supervisory authorities as Full Members of IFSB. IFSB’s efforts for developing Islamic regulations as well as accounting, auditing and governance standards will facilitate adoption of unified principles for the development, operation and regulation of Islamic financial services.  4 BIS Review 68/2007 
Philipp Hildebrand: Current state of the financial system in Switzerland Introductory remarks by Mr Philipp Hildebrand, Vice-Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the half-yearly media news conference, Berne, 14 June 2007. *      *      * I would like to use today’s publication of our Financial Stability Report as an opportunity to share some thoughts with you on the current situation of the financial system. I will start with the most important message – the Swiss banking sector and the financial system in general are in very good shape at the moment. Based on our analysis, the outlook for the future is also essentially positive. As stated in our report, the favourable situation in the Swiss banking sector comes as no real surprise. Developments in the economy and the financial markets in recent years have been very positive, both in Switzerland and abroad. Although economic growth has been strong, it has had practically no impact on inflation to date. The credit standing of borrowers remained high. In addition, despite repeated, significant short-term price corrections – as was the case last week – the stock markets rose sharply overall in an environment of low volatility. How can these positive developments be explained? And are there any risks involved – in particular for the stability of the Swiss financial sector? The good performance is not solely attributable to the favourable economic situation. Structural aspects have also played a role. With that I mean first and foremost the increased level of efficiency that has been achieved in the financial system in the past few years. This rise in efficiency can be ascribed to the innovativeness of financial markets. New financial instruments, such as credit derivatives, enable banks to separate their credit risk and transfer it either completely or partially. This facilitates a better distribution of credit risk in the financial system and means that the risk is borne by those who want to and are able to bear it. The improved efficiency has resulted in a reduction in the financing costs of companies and households. Lower financing costs help the economy and stock markets to achieve greater growth. The increased efficiency also appears to have improved the ability of global financial markets to absorb shocks. The downgrading of General Motors’ credit rating in 2005, for instance, or the major losses suffered by the hedge fund Amaranth last year had no lasting impact on stock and credit markets. All in all, global financial markets are currently better able to absorb shocks, at least small to medium-sized ones. Accordingly, serious turbulence in the financial system seems less likely today. From a financial stability perspective, this is a positive development indeed. However, the greater the stability of the financial markets, the greater the risk appetite of market participants tends to be. This in turn can increase the likelihood of a crisis and, in the event of one occurring, the extent of the damage. The greater concentration and interconnectedness in the global financial system may also have increased the magnitude of a potential crisis. The greater risk tolerance of market players is ultimately a logical consequence of the exceptionally long and stable period of calm in the financial markets. Market participants have had no reason of late to keep their risk-taking in check. Basically, anyone who held back felt they were missing the opportunity to generate high returns. Even the short-term corrections in the financial markets in February of this year and May of the previous year did not result in a change of attitude in this regard. On the contrary, the low impact made by these corrections and the ability of the markets to absorb them may have served as a confirmation for those operating a high-risk strategy to continue, and as an indication for the more risk-averse to take greater risks. The risk appetite is also fairly high in the Swiss banking sector at present. In our Financial Stability Report, we indicate for instance that the domestically oriented banks – Raiffeisen, cantonal and regional banks – are currently incurring a relatively high interest rate risk. At the same time, the big banks have also exhibited an increased risk tolerance in recent years. Although Credit Suisse Group’s overall risk has declined in the past year, following the sale of Winterthur, both big banks have significantly increased their risk-taking in the banking business; particularly their exposure in trading and in foreign lending business. As a result, their trading books have virtually doubled since 2003 and BIS Review 67/2007 1 
are now clearly in excess of CHF 1,000 billion. This accounts for roughly two-thirds of the assets managed by the entire hedge fund industry. The fact that market participants take more risks in a stable environment is in itself not a problem. What is important is that they correctly assess their ability to bear risks and are able to handle poorer conditions. Driving 120 km/h along an empty motorway in good weather conditions is generally not dangerous for an experienced driver. It is a different story, however, if visibility is poor and traffic is heavy. If the speed is not adjusted accordingly, the chances of having an accident increase. Driving fast becomes dangerous if the speed is no longer in line with the driver’s capability and external conditions. Using this analogy, how does the current situation in the global financial markets and Swiss banking sector compare? As already mentioned, the overall impression at the moment is that we are driving quite fast. Unlike on the motorway, however, there are three reasons why it is difficult to judge if the speed is too high or if the market participants would be able to slow down in time were conditions to deteriorate. Firstly, it is not clear just how fast the car is going, or rather, how much risk is being entered into. This not only applies to the less regulated players in the financial system, such as hedge funds, but also to a certain extent to banks. For instance, the rating agency Moody’s came to the conclusion in a report1 published last year that banks generally do not disclose their risks sufficiently. In our Financial Stability Report, we also point out that it would be beneficial if Swiss banks were to provide more data in this regard. By providing more comprehensive data, banks would be helping investors and authorities to better assess the risks banks take. Banks should, for example, publish more results from their stress tests. Similar to crash tests, stress tests examine how severely the bank would be affected by a major crisis. Secondly, it is difficult to assess how the traffic would react in poor weather conditions. Even though the braking distance is relatively short on a dry surface, this is by no means a guarantee that the car will react in the same way on a wet or even icy road. A number of instruments currently in use in the financial system have not yet had to prove their worth in extreme stress situations. It is therefore not clear whether the risks for these new and complex products have been adequately assessed. These products are typically not assessed in a central market, but by using complex models. In other words, the analysis is not a mark-to-market one, but a mark-to-model one. The reliability of the mark-to-model approach, however, relies heavily on assumptions and on the availability of reliable data. Data on tail events (events that occur rarely, but have major repercussions) would be particularly beneficial for the calibration of models. There is, however, by definition hardly any data on such events. This begs the question as to whether the dangers associated with tail events are being correctly assessed using the available models, or whether model risks pose a problem. Thirdly, it is unclear whether the finance industry’s capital buffer – in the form of equity capital – is adequate to weather particularly bad storms. Like airbags in a car, equity capital is only rarely called into action. Yet, the more serious the accident, the more generously the bags should be filled with air. In the current economic environment, many market participants are highly leveraged, in other words, they have a low ratio of debt to equity capital. Low levels of equity capital can be compared to a thin airbag – they only protect against moderate shocks. It would only take a loss of 2–3% of the balance sheet total, for instance, for Swiss big banks to use up all their equity capital. Of course, a loss of this magnitude is highly unlikely. After all, the Swiss big banks are well-diversified, have sophisticated risk management models in place and have high risk-weighted capital ratios. This notwithstanding, such a loss cannot be ruled out. In fact, it represents a classic tail event: a loss of this kind is highly unlikely, yet would have dire consequences, particularly for the stability of the entire Swiss banking sector. In view of the aforementioned uncertainties in connection with risk assessment, would it not be justified to aim to create a somewhat more “well-padded” cushion of security, even if equity capital – like airbags – comes at a price? Finally, I would like to point out that central banks do not know better than banks or the market as to if and when and in what form a major crisis could hit the financial markets. In principle, we believe that the likelihood of severe disruptions in the financial system has actually declined as a result of innovations in the financial markets. At the same time, the repercussions of a crisis – should one occur                                                       1  Risk Disclosures of Banks and Securities Firms, Moody’s Investors Services, May 2006. 2 BIS Review 67/2007 
after all – could be particularly severe given the current situation. With this in mind, I feel it is important that market participants – including the Swiss banks – should increasingly take tail events into consideration in their assessments. Stress tests are especially suitable in this regard. In our Financial Stability Report, we also underline the importance of stress testing. This calls for an intensification of the cooperation between the authorities and the big banks so as to enhance the transparency and comparability when evaluating the resilience of the Swiss big banks. Within the context of this cooperation, it should also be ensured that the cost/benefit ratio of such an exercise remains adequate. BIS Review 67/2007 3 
Miguel Fernández Ordóñez: Overview of the Spanish economy in 2006 Address by Mr Miguel Fernández Ordóñez, Governor of the Bank of Spain, to the Governing Council of the Bank of Spain on the occasion of the presentation of the Annual Report 2006, Madrid, 14 June 2007. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen, In 2006 the behaviour of the world economy and of the European economy in particular provided a highly favourable setting for the continuation of the Spanish economy’s 13-year-long expansion. The world economy grew by 5.4% last year, up even on the high rates of the previous two years, this being the most dynamic three-year period of growth for more than 30 years. The strong increase in oil prices in the first half of the year and the less expansionary stance of macroeconomic policies did not check this dynamism, which was moreover compatible with the containment of inflation rates worldwide and with a more favourable financial market performance. The geographical distribution of growth was more balanced and more favourable for the Spanish economy. The notable recovery in the euro area, along with economic firming in Japan, offset the slowdown in the United States. The contribution of the emerging economies to the global expansion, with China and India to the fore with growth of around 10%, remained a key factor. Latin America also grew satisfactorily and its inflation fell to all-time lows, against a backdrop of generally prudent macroeconomic policies which have contributed to a further reduction in the region’s financial vulnerability. However, the meagre progress in structural reforms and the unorthodox direction taken by some countries’ economic policies may curtail future growth possibilities. In the short run the world economy can be expected to continue posting high growth, unless the US slowdown becomes more acute and the rest of the world is unable to continue growing under its own steam. Further ahead, the continuity of the high rate of expansion of the world economy is more uncertain. The increased efficiency and productivity gains brought about by globalisation, through greater trade integration and a far-reaching reallocation of resources and factors, might begin to weaken. In this setting, the emergence of protectionist tendencies – such as those manifest in the difficulties of moving the Doha round forward – is an added risk to continuing high growth. Inflation has remained contained worldwide. The growing integration of the emerging economies into the global economy, providing abundant low-cost labour, coupled with heightened competition on world markets and technological innovation have allowed price increases to moderate significantly. The anchoring of inflation expectations, to which the credibility acquired by central banks in their efforts to preserve price stability has contributed, and the headway in the programmes for structural reform and increased flexibility in economies have likewise eased inflationary pressures. All these developments have helped contain the upward pressures stemming from the impulse of domestic demand and have made the task of monetary policies easier. In 2006, as the strength of economic growth progressively alerted to the emergence of inflationary pressures, the monetary policy stance became less expansionary in virtually all economies, developed and emerging alike, and inflation rates held at low levels overall, without any substantial passthrough of higher energy prices to core inflation being discernible. Yet the reduction in spare capacity and labour market tightening will heighten inflationary pressures in many economies, and further oil price rises cannot be ruled out. Moreover, as the business cycle matures, the task of monetary policymakers may become more difficult, especially for certain central banks like the Federal Reserve which will have to square inflationary risks with those stemming from the economic slowdown. The euro area As already stated, the euro area economy finally managed to emerge from the phase of low growth experienced in recent years. GDP for the area grew at a rate of 2.9% in 2006, almost double that of the previous year and the highest rate since 2000. For the year as a whole, inflation, measured by the rate of increase of the HICP, stood as in 2005 at 2.2%, much influenced over the course of the year by oil price movements. Core inflation moved mildly upwards during the year, perhaps reflecting some BIS Review 67/2007 1 
minor indirect effect of the rise in energy prices against a background of strengthening activity and employment. Nonetheless, there has been notable wage moderation so far, perhaps in response to greater labour market flexibility and growing competitive pressures worldwide. But it remains to be seen how wages will react in the face of more buoyant domestic demand. Throughout 2006 the stance of demand-side policies was consistent with the pick-up in private agents’ spending. However, in the monetary policy realm, the strength of the recovery warranted a gradual adjustment in monetary conditions by the European Central Bank. Following the rise in official interest rates in December 2005, the ECB continued in 2006 progressively to withdraw the stimulus provided in recent years in the light of the observed risks to price stability in the medium term. Turning to budgetary policies, the improvement in the business cycle contributed decisively to tax revenue growing substantially above forecast in 2006 and to the euro area budget deficit declining by almost 1 pp. Given the persistence of high deficits in many countries, it is of paramount importance to harness the opportunity provided by the current boom to complete the ongoing restructuring of public finances and to push through measures to boost productivity and employment generation. Precisely in this latter area, the year 2006 saw progress – albeit uneven across countries and economic policy areas – in the application of the structural reform agenda. Undoubtedly, the favourable performance in 2006 in terms of employment and growth in activity is largely the result of the course of the business cycle. But it seems likely there are also incipient positive effects stemming from the structural reforms already implemented, which may be responsible for the high rate of job creation in this phase of the recovery and the rise in productivity. That would show how efforts to heighten incentives for labour market participation, to further market liberalisation and to create an environment conducive to innovation and the development of human capital ultimately bear fruit, highlighting the need for sufficient political resolve to persevere with the course of action embarked upon. At the end of the first half of 2007, the outlook for the euro area is the brightest in recent years. For one thing, domestic demand is expected to retain its current momentum. Investment in particular should continue to benefit from the persistence of propitious financial conditions, the strength of corporate earnings and the soundness of companies’ financial position, while household expenditure should continue expanding thanks to favourable employment developments. For another, exports are expected to continue faring favourably despite the likely easing in world growth. This central scenario faces the downside risk of a bigger-than-expected slowdown in the world economy. But, in contrast, a better performance of the European labour market might raise forecast growth rates. The inflation outlook for 2007 and 2008 suggests the rate of change of the HICP will hold at around 2%, in line with the definition of price stability. However, it cannot be ruled out that the strength of activity will lead to higher wage demands and to greater price-setting autonomy on the part of companies. Adding to these upside risks to inflation is the possibility of fresh oil price increases. In the expected setting of robust economic activity, wage moderation will remain an essential ingredient for containing inflationary expectations, which would help prolong the upturn. In the opening months of 2007, the ECB has continued closely to monitor these risks and, in general, economic developments in the area, so as to ensure that inflation expectations remain in line with the definition of medium-term price stability. The Spanish economy As indicated, the Spanish economy continued its long upturn last year, moving on a mildly accelerating path throughout the year. It posted a year-on-year rate of 4% in 2006 Q4, and 4.1% in Q1 this year. The buoyancy of activity is proving greater than forecast in early 2006. The recovery in the euro area has boosted exports, following their sluggishness in previous years, especially in 2005, and has supplemented the main factors that have been underpinning the expansion of the economy. There was some re-balancing in 2006 of the relative contributions of domestic expenditure and of net exports to GDP growth, following three years of progressive divergence between these two components. Overall, the contribution of net external demand improved, despite which the net borrowing of the nation increased once more, to 7.8% of GDP. Within domestic demand, consumption slowed slightly in 2006 and construction began to show signs of decelerating in Q4, a trend that ran into early 2007. However, investment in capital goods underwent a significant increase which is holding in the year to date. 2 BIS Review 67/2007 
Behind these developments in the Spanish economy, along with the improved external environment, is the continuing influence of the favourable factors that have underpinned its dynamism throughout this cyclical upturn. First, there is the impulse stemming from the Spanish economy’s integration into the euro area. That has been acting as a powerful spur to demand, as a result of the effects on confidence and expectations and, naturally, of the expansionary financial conditions that have continued to prevail in 2006, despite the change in the stance of the single monetary policy dating back to the closing months of the previous year. Further, there are the factors that have provided for growth on the supply side, including most particularly the growing demographic boost to the Spanish economy over the past decade, which is contributing, among many other aspects, to generating a substantial expansion in the Spanish economy’s growth capacity. Finally, the importance of reform initiatives in recent decades cannot be ignored, as these have promoted market flexibility and dynamism among agents and institutions. And pivotal too have been the recent macroeconomic and financial policies, which have been a guarantee for stability. All these factors have acted simultaneously, mutually reinforcing one another in such a way that it is difficult to assign a specific weight to any of them. Let me refer first to the demographic impulse, to which particular attention is devoted in the Annual Report presented today. Migrant flows, drawn by the substantial and constant expansion of demand, have been in turn a key factor in supply dynamics. This is because the rise in the immigrant population has increased the economy’s productive capacity by means of the incorporation of abundant labour resources, while it has at the same time contributed to sustaining domestic spending growth. The Report highlights the fact that the contribution of immigration to income generation has been greater than that arising from the mere increase in population, also helping to raise per capita income. The Report also indicates that the effects on the expenditure side seem to help galvanise investment and that, in the labour market, they have introduced elements of wage flexibility and boosted mobility. Furthermore, the dynamic effects of immigration have been bolstered by the impact of the growing participation of women in the labour market. With regard to demand-side impulses, it should be stressed that economic buoyancy has continued to be underpinned by monetary and financial conditions which, despite their gradual normalisation over the course of last year and in 2007 to date, remain loose for the Spanish economy. Although the cost of bank credit for households and firms and of fixed-income securities issues rose as the single monetary policy adopted a more neutral stance, these costs reached levels which, from a historical perspective, should be classified as moderate. In any event, somewhat less generous financing conditions than those prevailing during the recent period of exceptionally low interest rates are better suited to the circumstances of the Spanish economy. Consequently, they provide some relief following a lengthy phase of high demand pressure, while helping to make our growth pattern healthier. The strength of demand has been met by very favourable elements in the supply-side response. All the productive branches contributed positively to the expansion of output, though mention should be made of the continuing momentum of construction and the notable dynamism of the manufacturing branches, closely linked to the recovery in the European economies. It is worth noting once again the Spanish economy’s continuing high employment-generating capacity, both in 2006 and in early 2007, since this feature is playing a key role in the continuity of this long expansionary cycle. The strong growth of employment in 2006, at a rate of more than 3% for the year on average, contributed decisively to sustaining domestic spending. And it has also enabled the growing incorporation of the population (particularly the female population) into the labour market to be compatible with further cuts in the unemployment rate, which stood at 8.5% on average in 2006, the lowest level since the late 1970s and practically on a par with the euro area average rate. The behaviour of employment denotes changes of some depth in the Spanish labour market, such as the marked fall in the structural unemployment rate, which may be interpreted as an increase in the scope available for generating employment without wage pressures arising. The counterpart to an employment-intensive growth pattern has been modest increases in actual productivity. It is difficult to offer an accurate diagnosis of the reasons for this, given the difficulties of measuring and estimating productivity in the presence of significant structural changes, such as the composition effects arising from the concentration of growth in sectors that are relatively less dynamic productivity-wise. But what are possibly being reflected here are shortcomings in the quality of factors of production and in the characteristics of the business sector. BIS Review 67/2007 3 
That said, the responsiveness of supply is not proving sufficient to counter the pressure of expenditure on price formation. On one hand, compensation per employee quickened somewhat in 2006, but to a lesser extent than did wage settlements, as a result of the changes in composition and the factors boosting labour market flexibility that I referred to earlier. On the other, in a climate of buoyant sales, the widening of business margins continued, albeit at a lesser rate than in previous years. All these factors, combined with the rise in oil prices in the first half of the year, meant that inflation rose in 2006 and that the inflation differential with the euro area stood at 1.4 pp. Inflation began to perform more favourably in the closing months of 2006, a trend that has run into 2007, with the related differential being cut to 0.5 pp. Foreseeably, these inflation dynamics will remain in place for several months. But it should not be forgotten that the improvement has a temporary component, linked to the path of oil prices, and that core inflation remains at 2.5%, despite the continuing restraint of import prices. Price and cost increases in 2006 once again outpaced those of our competitors, prolonging the deteriorating trend of the indices that measure relative prices and costs. Insofar as this difference is not warranted by quality improvements, the trend of these indices reflects a loss in competitiveness, whose adverse consequences for growth will become patent once domestic demand moves back onto a normal footing. The outlook for the Spanish economy points to the continuation of the main features recently observed, namely: the restructuring of spending, thanks to a gradual easing in domestic demand, particularly in consumption and residential investment, and an improvement in the contribution of net external demand. The confirmation of these trends would allow for the projection forward of economic dynamism at somewhat more moderate rates, in line with growth potential. For this to occur, however, further progress in slowing spending and household and corporate debt, and in improving the economy’s supply-side conditions, is needed. We must not forget that the long expansionary phase of the Spanish economy has been accompanied by a buildup in certain imbalances that pose considerable risks to its sustainability. Thus, until they are sufficiently corrected, we should avoid complacency. Admittedly, recent months have seen slower growth in household debt and a gradual slowdown in house prices, while the inflation differential with the euro area has narrowed. But it is important these processes continue to head off the risks the Banco de España has been warning about. Economic policymakers have a major responsibility to take advantage of the current economic prosperity to adopt, on a preventive basis, the measures required to harness the existing opportunities and to mitigate the risks that may arise. The change in the single monetary policy stance dating back to late 2005 has contributed to gradually normalising the financial conditions under which households and firms take their spending decisions, although monetary conditions are still accommodative for the Spanish economy. Turning to fiscal policy, buoyant revenue, which continues systematically to grow above budget, has provided for an improvement in programmed objectives. Achieving fiscal surpluses in expansionary phases, as established under the new budgetary stability laws, not only proves suitable for easing demand pressures, but also for retaining sufficient room for manoeuvre in the face of potential deviations from the scenario of economic dynamism and, naturally, for further restructuring public finances in order to absorb the future consequences of population ageing. This is, unquestionably, the main challenge for public finances in the medium term. The agreement reached last year under the Toledo Pact also addresses the goal of ensuring the sustainability of the pensions system, although the measures adopted are still of limited scope. It should be recalled, however, that the high growth of public revenue has a difficult-to-estimate temporary component that is linked in part to the strength of the real estate sector. Accordingly, budgetary consolidation may require an additional effort to control primary spending. The collaboration of regional and local government is vital in this connection, as they are responsible for major spending components such as public investment, health and education. This consolidation strategy should, moreover, be compatible with an improvement in the quality of public finances, since that is essential for raising incentives and for helping overcome the shortfalls in education, innovation and productivity. But when you are part of a monetary union, the most valuable economic policy instrument is, as our own experience indicates, the deepening of reforms in order to increase the responsiveness of supply and the adaptability of the business and productive sectors to the major changes the economy is undergoing, such as globalisation and population growth. 4 BIS Review 67/2007 
Specifically, the dynamism and flexibility injected into the labour market by the aforementioned phenomena of immigration and growing female participation need to be accompanied by the development of a more appropriate institutional framework, without forgoing the unquestionable achievement of good industrial relations. Despite the progress achieved by labour market reforms in recent years, the need remains to better tailor collective bargaining arrangements to the different industry- and firm-level requirements and to reduce the costs associated with permanent contracts. These measures should be complemented by others aimed at improving the quality of the labour factor, by giving greater priority to educational policy in order to redress the secondary education deficit, adapt university courses to new demands and promote effective continuous training for workers. Improving the efficiency of the economy likewise requires increasing investment in physical and technological capital, fostering innovation, pushing through privatisation where appropriate and stepping up the pace of the processes undertaken in recent years to heighten competition. The infusion of competition is particularly relevant in industries pivotal to spreading gains in efficiency to the rest of the economy, such as the network industries, the telecommunications market, the energy sector and rail transport. Some of these liberalising measures are detailed in the National Reform Programme so that, irrespective of the need to design other new measures, it would be advisable to apply this Programme more resolutely. Also, advantage should be taken of the transposition of the Services Directive to define a more straightforward and competitive regulatory framework for these activities. Education, innovation, market liberalisation and, broadly, all reforms geared to increasing productivity are of the utmost importance looking ahead to the long term. In recent years the welfare of Spanish citizens has been increasing thanks to better use of the labour factor. This is worth celebrating since for a long time the Spanish economy’s main problem was in fact a persistently high unemployment rate. But as we draw closer to success in this area (the long-term unemployment rate is now around 2%), it will be more difficult to obtain additional welfare gains as a result of increases in the employment rate. Before it is too late, we should realise that productivity is the main source of welfare in the long run, and the policies that promote this are therefore decisive for shaping the future of the Spanish economy. The financial system The behaviour of Spanish households and corporations in 2006 once again posed fresh challenges to the financial system. Given that public and private investment continued to increase, the net borrowing of the economy rose from 6.5% to 7.8% of GDP. But what is more, household and corporate purchases of financial assets inside and outside Spain increased, the result being that gross financing required by both sets of agents climbed from 35.6% to 44.7% of GDP. Indeed, although household consumption posted a somewhat lower growth rate than in 2005, as disposable income moderated even more, household saving as a proportion of household disposable income continued falling. Given that investment in housing continued to increase at a high rate, household net borrowing rose to 1.5% of GDP. Nonetheless, changes in interest rates and property price levels themselves began to temper the demand for housing, with the volume of transactions easing off and a slowdown in prices. Yet significant underpinnings for the dynamism of housing demand in the medium and long run remain as a result of socio-demographic factors – such as the thrust of immigration, the growing incorporation of women into the labour market and the reduction in the average family size – which will continue to translate into substantial increases in the number of households. These socio-demographic factors, which were not present in the final stages of the previous upturn in this market, will allow activity to stabilise, on this occasion, at higher levels than was the case then. In the new setting of less relaxed financial conditions, Spanish households began to resort less to credit as a means of financing their expenditure. But the slowdown was still modest, it affected only house purchase loans and it did not suffice to curb the rising trend of the sector’s debt/income ratio. The associated interest burden also increased, further boosted by the rise in interest rates. Thus, although there has been some headway in Spanish households adapting their spending and saving patterns to the progressive withdrawal of the monetary stimulus, this is still limited. In the corporate realm, however, the presence of other factors meant that the increase in interest rates scarcely affected corporate investment and debt. As earlier stated, investment in capital goods BIS Review 67/2007 5 
became the most dynamic expenditure component in 2006, owing principally to two factors: the pressure exerted by demand on the degree of capacity utilisation, which drew close to its historical high; and the sound results posted by most companies along with their favourable outlook. The buoyancy of investment was duly reflected in the sector’s debt ratios. These increased once again, fuelled by bank lending growth rates of around 30%. Significantly, however, a very sizeable portion of funds raised was earmarked for financing Spanish institutions’ participation in various mergers and acquisitions. These M&A operations showed renewed vigour in 2006 not only in Spain but also worldwide. As in the case of households, the simultaneous increase in liabilities and in the related borrowing costs translated into an increase in the interest burden borne by corporations. Foreseeably, the ongoing moderate rise in interest rates will ultimately emit a timely signal to companies to adjust their investment and business expansion projects to real future earnings possibilities. In that way the financial risks that might jeopardise the continuity of investment will be lessened. The financial institutions of all countries benefited from an exceptionally benign environment, in both macroeconomic and financial market terms. Specifically, the balance sheets and income statements of Spanish credit institutions were notably sound, with returns on equity not only greater than those of the previous year but also far above those relating to risk-free assets. Their ROE stood at around a level of 20%, 3 bp up on 2005, with a spread of 16% over long-term government bond yields. These trends are similar to those observed in major international institutions, which show sound levels of returns on equity along with wide spreads over government bond yields. Yet this situation should not lead to complacency. On the contrary, it is precisely the favourable circumstances of financial institutions, as reflected in their levels of profitability and solvency, that allows us to discuss more freely the risks and uncertainties they must face in the coming years. Financial innovation and the activity of new market agents should be viewed as positive developments. The emergence in recent years of new products, such as credit derivatives and CDOs (collateralised debt obligations), and deeper markets for other more traditional products, such as asset-backed securities, have provided financial market agents with a new range of profit and risk possibilities, allowed more dynamic and intensive risk management, and made for greater diffusion and better diversification of risk. Similarly, the emergence of new operators, with investors prepared not only to assume new risks but particularly to do so over longer terms, has in recent years enabled shocks to be absorbed on markets with a lower level of stress and, subsequently, lower volatility. Finally, regulated and non-regulated financial institutions alike, by increasingly having better risk management systems, combined with supervisory and regulatory models based not on coercive restrictions but on providing incentives for proper risk management, contribute clearly to market stability. Unsurprisingly, as a result of all these factors, the international financial system has demonstrated notable stability and substantial capacity to absorb adverse impacts level-headedly, ensuring that the few episodes of overreaction have been very short-lived. However, these structural improvements should not mask the fragilities inherent in this new and more complex environment. The improvements based on proper risk management and diversification are genuine ones. But they entail considerable management complexity and the growing involvement of agents not subject to prudential supervisory arrangements who do not yet have tried and tested experience in managing the risks assumed in more adverse economic environments. Moreover, their information on such risks is abundant, but not systematised, and is fragmentary and limited in depth. It is therefore likely that the risk of financial crises in the future will be less, but it is also possible that, if such crises emerge, they will do so with greater intensity than in the past. The improvements arising from new products and financial agents have enabled institutions to spread risks and dilute the impact that an upward revision of the risk premium might have on their balance sheets. But there is considerable uncertainty about the final destination of financial risk, since this is neither created nor destroyed, only transformed or diluted. The most desirable outcome would be for risk to end up at new institutions that can withstand negative returns in the short term without having to close out positions or cut back risk exposures. If ultimately it is pension funds that are going to retain the risk, concern should be voiced about the mismatch between increasingly sophisticated financial markets that defuse the risk in an optimal fashion and consumers whose financial knowledge has not evolved in step with market sophistication, and who remain rooted in a very elementary financial culture. 6 BIS Review 67/2007 
Spanish credit institutions, with a traditional business model based on long-term relationships with retail customers, are more sheltered from this complexity than other international banks that are more active on financial markets and have deeper interactions with the markets. But in a globalised world with complex interrelations, we can no longer think solely in national terms. And especially when our financial system finances its ordinary activity not only through its Spanish customers but also with funds raised on the European market. The growing integration of the single financial markets can now be seen in many facets. First, some market segments, of particular importance for Spanish institutions, already enjoy full integration, and talking of the Spanish environment in this connection is meaningless. The integration of the interbank markets, the public debt markets and the markets for subordinated debt and preference share issues is, quite simply, complete. In the market segments of high-volume business financing, and equities, the degree of integration in the recent period has been substantial. And in other markets, such as retail banking, a lesser degree of integration is compatible with growing cross-border competition through M&As or branches and subsidiaries. In addition to this there is the practical importance and potential impact that European regulations emanating from Brussels have for Spanish institutions. Such regulations include most notably the IFRSs (International Financial Reporting Standards), the new Capital Requirements Directive (the Basel II Directive) and the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MIFID). On the basis of all these elements, the conclusion is that the prudential supervisor of Spanish credit institutions cannot disregard the growing practical importance of the European environment, which precludes thinking in strictly Spanish terms. This is so with regard to the diagnosis of institutions, to the risks they face in the medium and long run, and to the instruments they have to mitigate such risks. Traditionally, the Spanish supervisory model has been able to combine a demanding stance in respect of institutions’ risks with incentives for best-practices management. This has positioned Spanish institutions among the most efficient and profitable in the world, and the Spanish economy has benefited from a highly competitive financial system. In the coming years the challenge is successfully to transmit these values in the European context, but also to assimilate the best international – and specifically European – supervisory practices. We must allow our institutions to harness the benefits the single financial market can offer them. Accordingly, in overseeing our institutions, we should limit the inevitable cost all supervision entails, applying prudential policies that encourage appropriate risk management, through the tempered use of restrictive or coercive measures in relation to banks’ activities, and through the use of more effective instruments for obtaining prudential information. The second consideration on the European market is the need for all European supervisors to redouble their efforts as regards mutual collaboration. Indeed, we must move from collaboration to cooperation, and from there to joint action and mutual trust, if we wish to be capable of properly supervising a European financial market with increasingly blurred national boundaries. It should also be acknowledged that the build-up over time of new European financial regulations, even though they have been beneficial to European financial intermediaries and institutions, has posed an organisational challenge to institutions. It is thus not surprising that they have called on Brussels to contain the rate at which new regulations are promulgated.  All European regulators and supervisors, including the European Commission, agree on the need for the thoroughgoing implementation of approved regulations. But we also agree on the advisability of avoiding new regulations in the coming years. The Banco de España has sought, as far as possible, to limit the attendant costs, whether through unifying accounting criteria for reporting to the market, for prudential purposes and for calculating tax bases, through the convergence of our criteria with those demanded by other supervisors, such as the so-called national discretion clauses in Basel II, or through our circulars, i.e. specific regulations that provide institutions with the necessary legal certainty. But new financial regulations cannot be dispensed with indefinitely, since it is quite possible that the very dynamics of European market integration will entail the need for new regulations in specific fields. Indeed, new reforms may even prove appropriate for Spanish institutions. For example, the fragmentation of deposit guarantee arrangements in Europe, in terms of financing, structure and organisation, might warrant a new Directive, which in turn would level the playing field, given the greater rigour of the Spanish system. I would not wish to conclude these considerations on the growing importance of the European component of our financial system without referring in particular to the euro area financial market. Indeed, financial integration is even greater for the European countries making up the euro area: their banking systems draw on a common pool for their funds, through bank loans, medium-term financing BIS Review 67/2007 7 
(whether subordinated or not), securitisations and mortgage covered bonds. The existence of this integrated market for the euro area has allowed certain financial systems in the area to finance their economy’s upturn with the funds from other financial systems operating with less pronounced cycles. This is a most favourable development as it allows financial institutions with surplus funds to earn more efficient and higher returns, thereby sustaining the profitability of their business, while providing demanders of funds with more stable financing for their most profitable lending business. Evidently, the outcome for the euro area economies is a more efficient use of financial resources, which are routed towards the most productive activities. Let me now analyse in greater detail the situation of Spanish deposit institutions. As earlier stated, their banking activity grew notably in 2006 both as regards lending to corporations and to households. This sizeable increase in activity is one of the reasons behind the highly favourable earnings performance of Spanish institutions. However, if activity were to slow in the future, income statement margins might suffer. In that case, as in any other business, but all the more so in an industry as competitive as Spanish banking is, it would be of paramount importance to have flexible cost structures capable of adapting to new scenarios. Indeed, once the property market has moved onto a more moderate path, institutions will not only be confronted with a volume challenge, but also one of type of business. Specifically, they will progressively have to limit the importance accounted for by the property sector in their lending portfolios in recent years, moving towards other activities. In the design of these strategies it is to be hoped that easy, short-termist decisions, but which have highly negative potential in the medium term, will not be adopted. Entities should not succumb to the temptation of offsetting the slowdown in demand with a decline in credit quality standards. Recently, some concern was detected in this connection in the US mortgage market, especially in relation to subprime lending to the least creditworthy segments of the population. Such lending in the United States is usually to borrowers with a poor credit history or with little documentation of income that makes it difficult to properly assess their creditworthiness. In Spain, if we identified as subprime those operations with individuals who at some point in the past have failed to meet their credit obligations, the amounts extended to such individuals would stand at around 1.27% of the overall mortgage funds lent, compared with levels for the US subprime market of around 14% of mortgage loans. That is to say, if there were a business segment of this type, it would be very small. Bad debt ratios in the Spanish mortgage market stand at 0.4%, compared with 4% in the United States. The information available for Spain therefore precludes talking of a market of this type. Regarding bad debts, the aggregate ratio for the sector during 2006 was on a declining trend and, in any event, is holding at minimum levels, whether analysed from a historical perspective or in comparison with institutions in other euro area countries. In other words, this indicator of the credit risk borne by institutions is not currently showing signs of difficulties feeding through to the industry, and this despite the higher growth of doubtful assets over the course of 2006. This higher growth, however, must be analysed bearing in mind at least two considerations. First, the increase in doubtful assets is due in part to the strong growth in activity recorded in recent years. In an expansionary setting it is logical that, if the volume of credit increases, the volume of doubtful assets will afterwards increase with some delay even if default probabilities hold constant. Second, it should not be forgotten that the changes in accounting rules introduced by the Banco de España to adapt to International Financial Reporting Standards mean that doubtful assets must be recognised earlier and in a higher proportion. That said, and while acknowledging the low default levels in the Spanish banking system, it seems clear there is no further room for further reductions in the ratio. Looking ahead, against a background of slowing credit growth, these ratios will conceivably tend to rise, converging at levels that may be considered as more normal in such a setting, while similar to those prevailing among our European partners. Moreover, both past experience and the findings of various studies show that risk tends to emerge with some delay in relation to the time it is assumed. In any event, a rise in the doubtful assets ratio should not in itself be viewed as a cause for alarm; it should rather be understood as another of the various indicators needed to assess institutions’ financial capacity. Although deposits trended more favourably in 2006 than in previous years, institutions had to resort to securities issues, subordinated financing and asset securitisations to meet the growing demand from households and firms for funds. Going to international markets in search of funds may make Spanish institutions more sensitive to external difficulties while exerting additional pressure on their operating margins, although it is true that resort is mainly to the euro area markets. Indeed, the fact that Spain has joined this area of stability has meant that our institutions have been able to finance an expansionary process like the one we have experienced.  8 BIS Review 67/2007 
One positive aspect is that institutions are raising finance especially by resorting to medium-term resources, which are more stable than those that might be obtained on the interbank market. Insofar as the secondary markets are sufficiently liquid, subordinated debt or preference share issues can contribute to greater market discipline. Moreover, asset securitisations allow a portion of risks to be transferred towards other investors, thereby contributing to better risk management. Despite the challenges ahead for Spanish institutions, their resilience was heightened in 2006. Profits – the first line of defence against potential problems – not only increased notably but were also sound. This was reflected in the main income statement margins which, combined with moderate growth in operating expenses, contributed to the favourable dynamics of earnings last year. The return on equity increased once again, maintaining, as earlier indicated, a wide spread over long-term government bond yields. The solvency of Spanish institutions held stable in 2006, with the attendant ratio comfortably above regulatory requirements. This came about, moreover, in a setting in which the sharp growth of activity exerted upward pressure on capital requirements. Earnings in 2006 and solvency levels thus attested to the sound position of Spanish institutions. And this was further corroborated by the available market indicators, by the stress tests conducted during the IMF Financial Sector Assessment Programme (FSAP) and, subsequently, by the loss distribution method, which shows that, even in a highly unfavourable scenario, any losses generated would be amply covered by the capital in the system. I should not wish to conclude this address without highlighting the need to further efforts in the financial education of consumers. In early 2007 the Banco de España released a new version of the Bank Customer Portal, but much remains to be done. The growing complexity and sophistication of the international financial system is, as I mentioned, creating a “knowledge gap” between financial institutions and final investors. And far from closing, the gap is widening. Supervisors, along with the other authorities involved in safeguarding consumer rights, must step up and, above all, combine their efforts in this field, since bank customers with a sound financial grounding are a vital pillar in a sound, competitive and stable financial system. It remains only for me to express my thanks, which it is a pleasure to do. During these first 11 months of my term of office I have had the good fortune to work closely with this Governing Council, the Executive Commission, the Deputy Governor and the Directors General, and to have received the firm support of the Bank’s staff. I thank you all and, after having celebrated the 150th anniversary of the adoption of the name Banco de España, I can bear witness to the fact this institution is performing increasingly better the tasks entrusted to it.

Axel A Weber: Germany's economic perspectives and European monetary policy  Speech by Professor Axel A Weber, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the annual dinner of the German-British Chamber of Industry & Commerce, London, 14 June 2007. *      *      * 1 Introduction  Dear Lord Mayor, My Lord, Minister, Dear Sir Nigel, Dear Mr Wood, Dear Mr Hoppe, Ladies and Gentlemen.  First of all, I want to thank you for inviting me to your annual dinner. Being in London is always a pleasure for me, not least because I spent some time here as a visiting fellow at Queen Mary college, the University of London – albeit nearly 20 years ago. For me, coming to London therefore means coming back to a city I know well and of which I have happy memories.  Over the next few minutes, I shall be saying some words on both Germany’s economic situation and on European monetary policy.  2  Germany’s economic situation and prospects  At the outset, let me briefly recall how Germany’s economy has been performing over the past few quarters. In a nutshell: in the course of last year, Germany increasingly began to act as the economic engine of the euro area. In 2006, German real GDP grew by 3.0% in calendar-adjusted terms, which was the highest rate since 2000. This development stood in stark contrast to 2002-2004, when the German economy put in a dismal performance overall.  And, even in 2005, German real GDP grew by only 0.9%, which was not impressive either. But simply looking at the annual growth rate in 2005 would mean overlooking the positive tendency during the course of that year, with quarterly GDP rates accelerating.  Regarding the current stage of Germany’s upswing, one thing in particular is worth mentioning. In comparison with the beginning of the current upswing, the economic expansion in progress is no longer being driven mainly by external demand in the form of strong exports. In fact, business investment has become the main factor fuelling economic growth at present.  Strong corporate investment, in addition to still buoyant export demand, has been driving Germany’s economic expansion over the past few quarters.  What we have observed so far might be called the “classical pattern” of the German “business cycle chain”, which consists of three elements.  - First, an initial demand stimulus in the form of strong exports.  - Second, as a result of this stimulus, a stepping-up of corporate investment.  - Third: an increase (albeit rather slight up to now) in private consumption.  All in all, Germany’s economic development over the past six quarters or so has exceeded most analysts’ forecasts – including my own, which was already higher than those of many market participants.  Against this favourable backdrop, there arises the question of what has actually been the main reason for the German economy rebounding so strongly, especially given its weak performance at the beginning of this decade.  One crucial element in this success story has been wage moderation. Wage moderation can be seen as the result of a learning process that was set in motion by two factors – the competitiveness problems of major industrial sectors, and stubbornly high rates of unemployment. This process was accompanied by enterprises’ restructuring efforts, which have led to a falling level of corporate debt and a marked decline in the corporate sector’s net interest burden.  BIS Review 66/2007 1 
Both factors have played a major part in the regaining of German industry’s price competitiveness, which explains the resurgence of Germany’s economy to a large extent.  Looking into the future, will today’s upward dynamics be of a lasting nature? Will Germany’s economy be maintaining its strong momentum in the quarters to come?  My answer is probably “yes”. I think there are several reasons to be rather optimistic. We are currently experiencing an economic upturn with a favourable outlook.  My positive assessment is based mainly on three likely facts. First: The global economy remains on its strong growth path. According to IMF estimates, in 2007, global economic activity is expected to expand above its long-term average for the fifth year in succession.  German enterprises are well placed to participate fully in this positive development of the global economy. In many countries, there is a large demand for high-quality capital goods, a market segment in which German enterprises have traditionally been strongly represented. Seen in this light, exports are likely to continue generating major stimuli for the upswing in Germany.  Second: With regard to the domestic economy, too, the prospects for a continuation of the upswing are promising. What is particularly important is that business investment is likely to remain a major factor underpinning economic activity. The current high level of utilisation of industrial plant capacity and a considerable need for replacement investment suggest that investment is still clearly on the up. In addition, external financing conditions remain favourable. Moreover, firms’ underlying sentiment is also very optimistic, which means that not just the recent hard data, but also soft indicators and the “psychological factor” signal stronger future capital formation.  Third: The marked ongoing improvement in the labour market situation should support the strengthening of private consumption. This means that there is the potential for a self-sustaining upswing in Germany.  Overall, German economic growth has not only gained momentum but has also become more broad-based over recent quarters. Hence, the conditions are in place for the upturn to last for a considerable period of time.  Against this backdrop and not surprisingly, Germany is no longer seen as “the sick man of Europe” as was the case at the beginning of this decade. The UK, too, was once stuck with this rather unpleasant label, even though that was roughly 30 years ago.  During the past ten years, however, the UK has been experiencing sustained economic growth while inflation has remained largely under control. Mervyn King, the Governor of the Bank of England, has frequently referred to this development as the “nice decade”, a pun in which “nice” stands for “non-inflationary consistently expansionary”.  Given Germany’s disappointing economic performance on average since the mid-1990s, we certainly cannot describe our economic development during this time in a similar manner. While inflation has been contained, economic growth in Germany over the past ten years just cannot be portrayed as constantly expansionary. On the contrary: on average, growth in the UK over the past 10 years has been nearly 2.8% per annum, whereas the German economy has grown, on average, by a mere 1% year on year.  However, when comparing the economies of Germany and the UK, there are two things, besides differences in growth performance, which are particularly striking. First, during the past ten years, the share of Germany’s total industry in economic value added has remained quite stable at roughly one-quarter. In the UK, by contrast, total industry’s share declined from one-quarter in 1997 to roughly 17 per cent last year, while added value, especially of the service sector, showed a marked increase.  Deindustrialisation is a development which reflects a secular trend among most developed countries. Within this process, the development in the UK so far has been much more pronounced than it has been in Germany.  Second, during the past ten years, domestic demand in the UK has been by far the most important driver of economic growth, while external demand in the form of net exports has played a dampening role. In Germany, the picture is somewhat mixed. However, external demand contributed, on average, much more to economic growth between 2001 and 2005 than domestic demand, which began setting the pace in the course of last year.  2 BIS Review 66/2007 
Evidently, with regard to major structural features as well as growth drivers, there are substantial differences between the UK and Germany. However, the current economic performance of both countries clearly shows that enhancing growth and job creation is not necessarily the result of only one particular economic pattern. In fact, empirical evidence would seem to suggest that both the British and the German developments can yield favourable results.  Regardless of the differences just mentioned, one feature common to both economies has been that both have enjoyed a stability-oriented monetary policy over the past decade. The fact that the “Old Lady of Threadneedle Street” – the Bank of England – was granted independence ten years ago is certainly among the prominent factors explaining the UK’s economic performance during the past decade.  Let me continue with a brief look at European monetary policy.  3  European monetary policy  Last week, the ECB’s Governing Council decided to raise the key ECB interest rate by 25 basis points to 4%. This decision was taken in view of the prevailing upside risks to price stability over the medium term.  In brief, the underlying reasons for our decision were the following: incoming information has repeatedly indicated that the euro area is continuing to expand at a pace which is significantly faster than was generally expected one year ago. Looking to the medium-term future, the economic outlook remains favourable, too.  Against the backdrop of supportive external and internal economic conditions, the most recent Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections foresee average annual real GDP growth in the euro area in a range of between 2.3% and 2.9% this year, and between 1.8% and 2.8% in 2008. The risks surrounding this favourable outlook for growth are broadly balanced over the short term. Over the medium to long term, though, the balance of risks remains slightly tilted to the downside, owing mainly to external factors such as the possibility of further increases in oil prices, the fear of a rise in protectionist pressure, and concerns about possible disorderly developments in the wake of global imbalances.  Regarding price developments, inflation (as measured by the HICP) was 1.9% in May. According to Eurosystem staff projections, average HICP inflation is expected to be around 2%, or more precisely between 1.8% and 2.2%, this year and between 1.4% and 2.6% next year.  The risks to the outlook for price stability are predominantly on the upside, mainly due to increasing capacity utilisation in the euro area and gradually improving labour markets. This implies, for instance, that pricing power in market segments with low competition may increase and that wage developments might be stronger than expected. With respect to oil prices, too, there is still the possibility of further increases.  In addition, the vigorous expansion of money and credit aggregates in an environment of already ample liquidity is clearly amplifying these existing upside risks to price stability.  Against the backdrop of the positive economic environment in the euro area, our monetary policy stance is still on the accommodative side and far from being restrictive. Given that inflation is projected to remain above our stability threshold, we remain committed to countering risks to price stability over the medium term in order to solidly anchor inflation expectations at levels consistent with our definition of price stability.  When the Governing Council began increasing key interest rates in December 2005, there was widespread criticism. The main argument put forward by critics at that time was that the Governing Council was not taking due account of the economic environment, and that the rate hike therefore came too early.  Since then, however, most of the critics have had to admit that this decision, although heavily criticised at the time, was warranted.  This has important implications: in my view, had we not started increasing key interest rates in December 2005, we would have been “fallen behind the curve”. In such a case, monetary policy runs the risk of losing control over inflation expectations, which are only firmly anchored at levels consistent with price stability if monetary policy is credibly committed to that price stability target.  BIS Review 66/2007 3 
Our experience since December 2005 once again underscores that monetary policy has to be conducted in a forward-looking manner and, in turn, must not wait for risks to price stability to materialise. Metaphorically speaking, a stability-oriented monetary policy cannot be conducted by looking through the rear view mirror. Looking through the side window, that is relying primarily on current observations of growth and inflation, is not sufficient either, since today’s inflation cannot be influenced by current monetary policy decisions, owing to the long and variable lags of monetary policy transmission.  Thus, the only viable option for monetary policy is acting in a forward-looking manner in order to ensure price stability over the medium term.  Let me sum up: monetary policy in the euro area will do what is necessary to maintain price stability and thus contribute to supporting sustainable economic growth and job creation in the euro area. Germany’s economy is back on track and the outlook for Germany and the euro area over the medium-term future remains favourable. Dinner speakers should exhaust their topic, not the audience. Therefore: Thank you for your attention.  4 BIS Review 66/2007 
Rakesh Mohan: Capital account liberalisation and conduct of monetary policy – the Indian experience Paper by Dr Rakesh Mohan, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, presented at an International Monetary Seminar on Globalisation, Inflation and Financial Markets, organised by the Bank of France, Paris, 14 June 2007.  Assistance of Sanjay Hansda, Indranil Bhattacharyya, Partha Ray and M.D. Patra in preparing the paper is gratefully acknowledged. *      *      * I.  Overall approach The distinguishing feature of our overall reform process initiated in the early 1990s has been the accomplishment of high economic growth in an environment of macro economic and financial stability. In fact, we have achieved acceleration in growth while maintaining price and financial stability. During this period, apart from all the other reforms, we have achieved current account convertibility, and also opened the capital account to a substantial extent. With this growing openness, we have not been insulated from exogenous shocks. These shocks, global as well as domestic, included a series of financial crises in Asia, Brazil, Russia and Mexico, in the 1990s and other events such as 9/11 terrorist attacks in the US, border tensions, sanctions imposed in the aftermath of nuclear tests, political uncertainties, changes in the Government, and the current oil shock. Nonetheless, stability could be maintained in financial markets. Indeed, inflation has been contained since the late-1990s to an average of around five per cent, distinctly lower than that of around seven to eight per cent per annum over the previous four decades. Simultaneously, the health of the financial sector has recorded very significant improvement. The story of Indian reforms is by now well-documented (e.g., Ahluwalia, 2002); nevertheless, what is less appreciated is that India achieved this acceleration in growth while maintaining price and financial stability. With increased deregulation of financial markets and increased integration of the global economy, the 1990s were turbulent for global financial markets: 63 countries suffered from systemic banking crises in that decade, much higher than 45 in the 1980s. Among countries that experienced such crises, the direct cost of reconstructing the financial system was typically very high: for example, recapitalisation of banks had cost 55 per cent of GDP in Argentina, 42 per cent in Thailand, 35 per cent in Korea and 10 per cent in Turkey. There were high indirect costs of lost opportunities and slow economic growth in addition (McKinsey & Co., 2005). It is therefore particularly noteworthy that India could pursue its process of financial deregulation and opening of the economy without suffering financial crises during this turbulent period in world financial markets. The cost of recapitalisation of public sector banks at less than 1 per cent of GDP is therefore low in comparison. Whereas we can be legitimately gratified with this record, we now need to focus on the new issues that need to be addressed for the next phase of financial development, particularly in the context of fuller capital account convertibility and increasing integration of financial markets. That the current annual GDP growth of around 8.5 to 9 per cent can be achieved in India with a level of gross domestic investment in the range of 30 to 33 per cent over the past 4 years suggests that the economy is functioning quite efficiently. Thus our policy of gradual and sequenced reform cannot be said to have been at the cost of growth or efficiency. We need to ensure that we maintain this level of efficiency and attempt to improve on it further. As the Indian economy continues on such a growth path and attempts to accelerate it, new demands are being placed on the financial system. In examining the conduct of monetary policy in India in the presence of continuing and gradual capital account liberalisation, a key lesson is that this process has to be viewed in the context of the overall reform process. As an economy undergoes the transition from a closed to an open economy, first on the current account and then on the capital account, the interest of financial stability is served by simultaneous action on a number of different fronts. The framework of monetary policy itself has to undergo a change from the previous direct methods of control of monetary aggregates to indirect methods imparting signals through the market. For such a change to be effective the monetary policy transmission process has to be strengthened through development of all financial markets, and the building of market micro-infrastructure. On the external front, the transition from a fixed or pegged exchange rate to a market determined one itself needs careful assessment of the efficiency of the foreign exchange market, the capabilities of market players and evaluation of effects of exchange rate BIS Review 66/2007 1 
volatility. The operation of financial markets and the degree of vulnerability that an economy becomes exposed to with greater opening is itself influenced significantly by fiscal conditions. Hence the efficacy of monetary policy, efficiency of financial markets, and external vulnerability are closely linked to the practice of prudent fiscal policy. Finally, for efficient monetary policy transmission, and depth, liquidity and efficiency of financial markets, financial intermediaries themselves have to be strengthened. It is in view of all these inter-linkages that I have chosen to provide a brief overview of developments in each of these areas as they have evolved over the past decade and a half in India. II.  Process of setting out monetary policy objectives General objectives  Traditionally, central banks pursue the twin objectives of price stability and growth or employment. In pursuing the basic objectives, central banks also need to keep in view considerations of orderly financial markets and financial stability. Needless to say, the objectives of monetary policy are interrelated and have trade-offs as well. The preamble to the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 sets out the Bank’s objectives as "to regulate the issue of Bank notes and the keeping of reserves with a view to securing monetary stability in India and generally to operate the currency and credit system of the country to its advantage". Although there is no explicit mandate for price stability, as is the current trend in many countries, the objectives of monetary policy in India have evolved as those of maintaining price stability and ensuring adequate flow of credit to the productive sectors of the economy. In essence, monetary policy aims to maintain a judicious balance between price stability and economic growth. The relative emphasis between price stability and economic growth is governed by the prevailing circumstances at a particular time and is spelt out from time to time in the policy announcements of the Reserve Bank. Considerations of financial stability have assumed greater importance in recent years in view of the increasing openness of the Indian economy, financial integration and the possibility of cross border contagion. As we observed the severe costs of financial instability elsewhere, financial stability has ascended the hierarchy of monetary policy objectives since the second half of the 1990s. Strong synergies and complementarities are observed between price stability and financial stability in India. Accordingly, we believe that regulation, supervision and development of the financial system remain within the legitimate ambit of monetary policy broadly interpreted. Framework Till 1997-98, monetary policy in India used to be conducted with broad money (M3) as an intermediate target. The aim was to regulate money supply consistent with the expected growth of the economy and the projected level of inflation. The targeted monetary expansion used to be set on the basis of estimates of these two crucial parameters. In practice, the monetary targeting framework was used in a flexible manner with feedback from developments in the real sector. In the wake of financial sector reforms and opening up of the economy in the 1990s, appropriateness of the monetary targeting framework was questioned with the changing inter-relationship between money, output and prices. Accordingly, the Reserve Bank switched over in 1998-99 to a multiple indicator approach. With this approach, interest rates or rates of return in different markets (money, capital and government securities markets), along with data on currency, credit extended by banks and financial institutions, fiscal position, trade flows, capital flows, inflation rate, exchange rate, refinancing and transactions in foreign exchange available on high-frequency basis, are all examined along with output in framing monetary policy. The specific features of the Indian economy, including its socio-economic characteristics predicate the investing of the monetary authority with multiple objectives for some time to come. While it could be desirable in the interest of clarity and transparency to stack up the objectives in a hierarchy, the jury is still out on the merits of public announcement of the policy weights assigned to each objective. Flexibility in the setting of monetary policy should override consideration of transparency so that public indication of weighting patterns associated with objectives should not solidify into a binding rule. Moreover, continuous monitoring of the underlying macro economic and financial conditions for monetary policy purposes will necessitate a continuous re-balancing of weights assigned to various objectives. In a pragmatic sense, therefore, it should suffice for the monetary authority to indicate the main objectives and an ordinal ranking, at best, to reflect the reading of underlying developments. 2 BIS Review 66/2007 
A single objective for monetary policy, as is usually advocated, particularly in an inflation targeting framework, is a luxury that India cannot afford, at least over the medium term. The cause of monetary policy is not lost, however; analytically, it can be shown that even if one of the multiple objectives is nominal among others that may be real, it can serve as the quintessential nominal anchor and enable monetary policy to work. This view is supported by a pragmatic and influential strand in the literature which questions the recent proliferation of inflation targeting as a monetary policy framework (Friedman, 2000; McCallum, 1981). As regards inflation targeting, as the monetary policy regime fulfilling the single mandate advocacy, the jury is still out. Even though there has been an increase in the number of central banks adopting inflation targeting since the early 1990s, a number of central banks, notably the Federal Reserve, retain multiple objectives. I am not a monetary scholar, but I do feel that, given the current domestic and international complexities, we need to continue with a flexible framework for monetary policy. The least we need in the current circumstances is a less simplistic approach. “In India, we have not favoured the adoption of inflation targeting, while keeping the attainment of low inflation as a central objective of monetary policy, along with that of high and sustained growth that is so important for a developing economy. Apart from the legitimate concern regarding growth as a key objective, there are other factors that suggest that inflation targeting may not be appropriate for India. First, unlike many other developing countries we have had a record of moderate inflation, with double digit inflation being the exception, and largely socially unacceptable. Second, adoption of inflation targeting requires the existence of an efficient monetary transmission mechanism through the operation of efficient financial markets and absence of interest rate distortions. In India, although the money market, government debt and forex market have indeed developed in recent years, they still have some way to go, whereas the corporate debt market is still to develop. Though interest rate deregulation has largely been accomplished, some administered interest rates still persist. Third, inflationary pressures still often emanate from significant supply shocks related to the effect of the monsoon on agriculture, where monetary policy action may have little role. Finally, in an economy as large as that of India, with various regional differences, and continued existence of market imperfections in factor and product markets between regions, the choice of a universally acceptable measure of inflation is also difficult” (Mohan, 2006b). It is important to recognise the reality of multiple objectives of monetary policy in India. Nonetheless, it needs to be appreciated that relative to the past, we need to communicate better on the objective of price stability and as firmly as possible, albeit without necessarily a precise numerical objective. Indeed, why should a monetary policy invested with multiple objectives choose to quantify only one – the inflation rate? Indeed, setting such a precise numerical objective for inflation runs the risk of loss of central bank credibility in the context of the dominance of supply side shocks emanating from sources such as monsoon failure and administered pricing of various agricultural commodities and petroleum products. Whereas the share of agriculture in GDP has been declining and is now less than 20 per cent, the sector continues to be extremely important since the majority of the population remains dependent on agriculture. Therefore, setting precise numerical targets for inflation is fraught with the risk of loss of reputation across a large constituency. Nevertheless, as the Indian economy becomes increasingly open with fuller capital account convertibility, the objective of progressively bringing inflation down to near international levels and maintaining price stability assumes greater importance. The experience of successfully bringing down inflation from persistent higher levels since the late 1990s to around 5 per cent in recent years has already brought down inflation expectations significantly.  As we place greater emphasis on low inflation and price stability, we also need to improve communication with respect to the understanding of inflation. At present, headline inflation in India is indicated by the weekly release of the All India Wholesale Price Index (WPI). Most countries use the Consumer Price Index (CPI) instead. The CPI is difficult to use in India because of the existence of 4 indexes of CPI, each reflecting the consumption basket of different sets of consumers in urban and rural areas. An appropriate inflation indicator should (i) reflect price changes of constituent items accurately and (ii) provide some understanding of headline inflation. Whereas it is feasible to construct an economy wide consumer price index on the lines of the harmonized consumer price index (HICP) adopted in the UK and the Euro Area, it is not clear how useful it would be as an indicator of the general price level, given the widely differing consumption baskets as between rich and poor, between rural and urban areas and even between regions in India. In fact, a measure of producer prices to which the wholesale price index (WPI) is akin, is likely to be more representative and familiar across the country, since these BIS Review 66/2007 3 
prices are more likely to be uniform across the country. Accordingly, the commodity/services based price index should be seen as useful more as an indicator/information variable than as defining the inflation objective. Moreover, the WPI is available on a weekly basis, with a two week lag, whereas the CPI indices are only available on monthly basis, and with a 2 month lag. Monetary policy should be more explicitly associated with managing inflation expectations rather than current inflation. Accordingly, the guiding criterion for inclusion of a variable in the inflation indicators panel should be the information content on future inflation. An important sub-set would be real sector indicators of future inflation such as variability of output around trend/potential, capacity utilisation, inventory, corporate performance, industrial/ investment expectations and other indicators of aggregate demand. We have initiated greater quantitative technical work in these areas over the last couple of years to better inform our monetary policy making with a forward looking approach. The Reserve Bank has also initiated inflation expectation surveys so that we can have some direct indicators of changing inflation expectations of the public. These quarterly surveys are still in the pilot testing stage so their results are not yet in the public domain. But the initial results look promising.  The more complex is the mandate for the central bank, the more is the necessity of communication (Mohan, 2005). The Reserve Bank of India clearly has complex objectives. Apart from pursuing monetary policy, financial stability is one of the overriding concerns of the RBI. Within the objective of monetary policy, both control of inflation and providing adequate credit to the productive sectors of the economy so as to foster growth are equally important. This apart, the Reserve Bank acts as a banking regulator, public debt manager, government debt market regulator and currency issuer. Faced with such multiple tasks and complex mandate, there is an utmost necessity of clearer communication on the part of the Reserve Bank. A significant step towards transparency of monetary policy implementation is formation of various Technical Advisory Committees (TACs) in the Reserve Bank with representatives from market participants, other regulators and experts. In line with the international best practices and with a view to further strengthening the consultative process in monetary policy, the Reserve Bank, in July 2005, set up a Technical Advisory Committee on Monetary Policy (TACMP) with external experts in the areas of monetary economics, central banking, financial markets and public finance. The Committee meets at least once in a quarter, reviews macroeconomic and monetary developments and advises the Reserve Bank on the stance of monetary policy. The Committee has contributed to enriching the inputs and processes of monetary policy setting in India. Whether any further institutional changes are necessary, however, remains an open question. III.  Development of monetary policy instruments and transmission process Consistent with the structural changes in the monetary policy framework, improvements in the channels of transmission emerged early on as a concurrent objective in order to enhance policy effectiveness. Monetary policy clearly cannot work without adequate monetary transmission and the appropriate monetary transmission cannot take place without efficient price discovery of interest rates and exchange rates in the overall functioning of financial markets and their integration. Therefore, the corresponding development of the money market, Government securities market and the foreign exchange market became necessary. Accordingly, from the 1990s, the RBI simultaneously undertook the development of the domestic financial market spectrum, sequenced into the process of deregulation of interest rates, the withdrawal of statutory pre-emptions, the qualitative improvement in monetary-fiscal coordination and the progressive liberalisation of the exchange and payments regime, including the institution of a market oriented exchange rate policy. The development of financial markets in India encompassed the introduction of new market segments, new instruments and a sharper focus on regulatory oversight. We have made a carefully calibrated transition from an administered interest rate regime to one of market determined interest rates over a period of time, while minimising disruption and preserving financial stability. This approach also provided market participants adequate time to adjust to the new regime. The growing market orientation of monetary policy has tilted the choice of instruments decisively from direct to more indirect and market-based monetary policy measures. Until the early 1990s, statutory pre-emptions in the form of cash reserve ratio (CRR) and statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) requirements locked away nearly 65 per cent of bank deposits, severely eroding the profitability of the financial system and effectiveness of monetary policy. The SLR was brought down from 38.5 per cent of net 4 BIS Review 66/2007 
demand and time liabilities (NDTL) in early 1992 to 25 per cent in October-1997. The CRR had been reduced progressively from 15 per cent in 1991 to 4.5 per cent in 2003, before it had to be increased again in steps to 6.5 per cent in the current monetary tightening phase. Monetary maneuverability has now been strengthened further with removal of the erstwhile floor of 3 per cent and ceiling of 20 per cent in CRR through a statutory amendment. The statutory minimum SLR of 25 per cent has also been removed to provide for greater flexibility in the RBI’s monetary policy operations. The key policy development that has enabled a more independent monetary policy environment was the discontinuation of automatic monetisation of the government's fiscal deficit since April 1997 through an agreement between the Government and the Reserve Bank of India in September 1994, marking a unique milestone in monetary-fiscal coordination. Another important institutional change was the freeing of the RBI’s balance sheet from the burden of exchange guarantees accumulated in the pre-reform era. Subsequently, enactment of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003 has strengthened the institutional mechanism further: from April 2006 onwards, the Reserve Bank is no longer permitted to subscribe to government securities in the primary market. This step completes the transition to a fully market based system for Government securities. Looking ahead, consequent to the recommendations of the Twelfth Finance Commission, the Central Government has now ceased to raise resources on behalf of State Governments, which now have to access the market directly. Thus, State Governments' capability in raising resources will be market determined and based on their own financial health. For ensuring a smooth transition, institutional processes are being revamped towards greater integration in monetary operations. Given the pivotal role of the money market in transmission, efforts initiated in the late 1980s were intensified over the full spectrum. Following the withdrawal of the ceiling on inter-bank money market rates in 1989, several financial innovations in terms of money market instruments such as certificate of deposits, commercial paper and money market mutual funds were introduced in phases. Barriers to entry were gradually eased by increasing the number of players and relaxing the issuance and subscription norms in respect of money market instruments, thus fostering better price discovery. In order to improve monetary transmission as also on prudential considerations, steps were initiated in 1999 to turn the call money market into a pure inter-bank market and, simultaneously, to develop a repo market outside the official window for providing a stable collateralised funding alternative, particularly to non-banks who were phased out of the call segment, and banks. The Collateralised Borrowing and Lending Obligation (CBLO), a repo instrument developed by the Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL) for its members, with the CCIL acting as a central counter-party for borrowers and lenders, was permitted as a money market instrument in 2002. With the development of market repo and CBLO segments, the call money market has been transformed into a pure inter-bank market, including primary dealers, from August 2005. A recent noteworthy development is the substantial migration of money market activity from the uncollateralised call money segment to the collateralised market repo and CBLO markets. Thus, uncollateralised overnight transactions are now limited to banks and primary dealers in the interest of financial stability. Technological upgradation has accompanied the development of the money market. Efforts are currently underway to introduce screen-based negotiated quote-driven dealings in call/notice and term money markets. Information on overnight rates and volumes would be disseminated by the RBI in order to enable market participants to assess the liquidity conditions in an efficient and transparent manner. The government securities market was moved to an auction-based system in 1992 to obtain better price discovery and to impart greater transparency in operations. This was a major institutional change, which, along with the freeing of the money and foreign exchange market and the phasing out of automatic monetisation of fiscal deficits, created a conducive environment for the progressive deregulation that was to follow. The setting up of well capitalised Primary Dealers (PDs) for dealing in Government securities followed in 1995, backed up by the introduction of Delivery versus Payment (DvP) for Government securities, adoption of new techniques of floatation, introduction of new instruments, particularly Treasury Bills of varying maturities and repos on all Central Government dated securities and Treasury Bills of all maturities by April 1997. Since April 1992, the entire Central Government borrowing programme in dated securities has been conducted through auctions. In 2005, the Reserve Bank put in place an anonymous order matching system to improve price discovery, and settlement procedures for mitigating risks. To further activate trading and improve the depth of the securities market, the introduction of a “when issued” market has also been announced recently. All these measures have brought about significant changes and a new treasury culture is developing, contributing to the formation of the term structure of interest rates. The BIS Review 66/2007 5 
demand for government securities is now driven more by considerations of effective management of liquidity rather than by statutory liquidity requirements. The Indian foreign exchange market has been widened and deepened with the transition to a market-determined exchange rate system in March 1993 and the subsequent liberalisation of restrictions on various external transactions leading up to current account convertibility under Article VIII of the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund in 1994. Since the mid-1990s, banks and other authorised entities have been accorded significant freedom to operate in the market. Banks have been allowed freedom to fix their trading limits and to borrow and invest funds in the overseas markets up to specified limits. They have been allowed to use derivative products for hedging risks and asset-liability management purposes. Similarly, corporates have been given flexibility to book forward cover based on past turnover and are allowed to use a variety of instruments like interest rates and currency swaps, caps/collars and forward rate agreements. The swap market for hedging longer-term exposure has developed substantially in recent years. A number of steps have also been taken to liberalise the capital account covering foreign direct investment, portfolio investment, outward investment including direct investment as well as depository receipt and convertible bonds, opening of Indian corporate offices abroad and the like. In recent years, the Reserve Bank has delegated exchange control procedures to banks and authorised dealers to such an extent that there is hardly any need to approach the Reserve Bank for any approval. These reforms are being reflected in vibrancy in activity in various segments of the foreign exchange market with the daily turnover over US $ 28 billion (as at the end of April 2007). A key area of emphasis in the development of financial markets in India is the provision of the appropriate technological infrastructure for trading, clearing, payment and settlement. Since the late 1990s, the establishment of a modern, robust payments and settlement system consistent with international best practices has emerged as an important objective of the RBI. A three-pronged strategy of consolidation, development and integration has been pursued in this regard. Consolidation revolves around strengthening the existing payment system by providing the latest levels of technology. The developmental dimension includes real time gross settlement, centralised funds management, securities settlement and structured electronic financial messaging. Other key elements in the technological content of market development are electronic clearing (introduced in 1994), electronic finds transfer (1996), quick funds transfers with centralised settlement in Mumbai (2003), negotiated dealing system (NDS), screen based order matching system (2002) for electronic reporting of trades and online dissemination system and submission of bids for primary issuance of government securities and a Clearing Corporation of India Ltd. (CCIL), promoted by banks, financial institutions and primary dealers for clearing and settlement of trades in foreign exchange, government securities and other debt instruments, commenced operations in April 2001. The CCIL acts as a central counterparty (CCP) to all transactions and guarantees settlement of trades executed through its rules and regulations eliminating counterparty risks in adherence to international best practices. Oversight over the payments and settlement system is vested in a National Payments Council, and Board for Payment and Settlement Systems established within the RBI. As may be seen from this brief description of the various measures that had to be taken to develop the market and institutional framework for efficient monetary policy transmission, development of markets is an arduous and time consuming activity that requires conscious policy making and implementation. Markets do not develop and function overnight: they have to be created, nurtured and monitored on a continuous basis before they start functioning autonomously. Efficient transmission of monetary impulses clearly needs integration of markets.  Issues Interest rate deregulation is essential to smoothen the transmission channels of monetary policy and to enhance the signaling effects of policy changes. Whereas considerable progress has been made in this direction, full deregulation is constrained by the need for various policy interventions in the context of a still developing economy. The Government had nationalised most of the banking system in 1969 in order to ensure the spread of banking throughout the country. Whereas new private sector banks have now been introduced since the mid 1990s, public sector banks still account for 70 per cent of banking assets. These banks need to continue to perform various public policy activities, particularly in the area of agriculture, small and medium enterprises, and the cause of overall financial inclusion. This can also include certain degree of credit allocation and interest rate directions. Hence, monetary transmission can get muted at the margin.  6 BIS Review 66/2007 
The Government also fixes certain administered interest rates on a number of small saving schemes and on provident funds, along with providing certain tax incentives, in the absence of well developed social security systems. As banks have to compete for funds with small saving schemes, the rates offered on long-term deposits mobilised by banks sometimes have to be set at levels higher than would have obtained under competitive market conditions. In fact, this has been observed to be a factor contributing to downward stickiness of lending rates, which has some implications for the effectiveness of monetary policy. This is a reality that we have to appreciate and live with given the absence of social security coverage and adequate safety nets in the country. These small savings schemes administered by the government through the wide reach of post offices, and some through commercial banks, provide small savers access to tax savings instruments that are seen as safe and stable. Whereas they do have some impact in terms of blunting monetary transmission mechanisms, they can perhaps be seen as contributing to overall financial stability. Benchmarking these administered interest rates to market determined rates has been proposed from time to time. Whereas some rationalisation in schemes has indeed been done, more progress will depend on the emergence of better social security and pension systems, and perhaps easier access to marketable sovereign instruments.  While the government securities market is fairly well developed now, the corporate debt market remains to be developed for facilitating monetary signaling across various market segments. We understand, however, that it has been difficult to develop the corporate bond market in most countries. Almost half the world's corporate bond market is in the US, and another 15 per cent in Japan. Among other countries, while the UK has a long standing bond market, the European bond market has only began to really develop after European monetary integration and introduction of the Euro. Among developing countries, it is perhaps only South Korea that has a reasonably well developed bond market.  In the absence of a well developed corporate debt market, the demand for debt instruments has largely concentrated on government securities with the attendant implications for the yield curve and, in turn, for monetary transmission. The secondary market for corporate debt has suffered from lack of market making resulting in poor liquidity. Corporates continue to prefer private placements to public issues for raising resources in view of ease of procedures and lower costs.  There is a need for development of mortgage-backed securities, credit default swaps, bond insurance institutions for credit enhancement, abridgment of disclosure requirements for listed companies, credit information bureaus, rating requirements for unlisted companies, real time reporting of primary and secondary trading, and eventual retail access to the bond market by non-profit institutions and small corporates. A concerted effort is now being made to set up the institutional and technological structure that would enable the corporate debt market to operate. Furthermore, the on-going reforms in the area of social security coupled with the emergence of pension and provident funds are expected to increase the demand for long-term debt instruments. In the process, the investor base for government securities would be broadened, extending the monetary transmission across new players and participants. For monetary policy to be more effective, the monetary transmission process has to be improved on a continuous basis so that price discovery is better. In this endeavour, we need to keep developing the various financial markets, increase their connection with credit markets, remove distortions in the market and reverse current tendency to move back to administered interest rates.  IV.  Development of financial markets There has been a great deal of progress in developing the money market, government securities market and forex market. With greater capital account openness, we need to develop them further to enable market participants to absorb greater volatility and shocks. Each of these markets needs to be deeper. In the context of progress towards further capital account convertibility, the market participants are going to be faced with increased risks on multiple accounts: volatility in capital flows, volatility in asset prices, increased contagion and state of ability of legacy institutions in managing risks. Money market The money market remains fragmented with different segments giving rise to different overnight rates. The call money market, which remains an uncollateralised market has now become a pure inter-bank market amongst banks and primary dealers with the withdrawal of non-banks. Alongside, primarily for BIS Review 66/2007 7 
non-bank participants at the shorter end, there is the market repo outside the repo market under the liquidity adjustment facility. This is a collateralised segment of money market. The collateralised borrowing and lending obligation (CBLO) market, operated by the CCIL amongst its members is yet another collateralised money market instrument. With the decision to move gradually towards a pure inter-bank call/term money market, there is a need to remove the operational/regulatory constraints in the repo market. One of the perceived hurdles in the development of the repo market is the inability to rollover contracts. To enable continuous access to funds from the repo market, rollover of repos has been allowed with migration to DvP III.  The issue remains what further developments are needed in terms of eligible collaterals, membership, etc to integrate the different segments of the money market so that the money market as a whole is enabled to cope better with market fluctuations in the run-up to fuller capital account convertibility. An important gap in developing the money market is that term money market is still to emerge and hence, the evolution of yield curve remains inadequate. We need to explore what is to be done to build this market with further opening of capital account.  Interest rate derivatives The need for a well developed interest rate derivatives market cannot be overemphasised in providing effective hedging tools for interest rate risks present in the balance sheet and in facilitating trading based on two-way view on interest rates, which is not possible in the underlying cash market in the absence of short selling. Deregulation of interest rates, which helped in making financial market operations efficient and cost effective, has brought to the fore a wide array of risks faced by market participants. To manage and control these risks, several instruments such as Forward Rate Agreements (FRA) and Interest Rate Swaps (IRS) were introduced in July 1999, which could provide effective hedges against interest rate risks. Further, in June 2003, the Reserve Bank of India had issued guidelines to banks/primary dealers/FIs for transacting in exchange traded interest rate futures, which were introduced on the exchanges. There has also been a sharp increase in the volume of transactions in the OTC products. Though there has been a significant increase in the number and amount of contracts, participation in the markets continues to remain limited mainly to select foreign and private sector banks and PDs. In fact, PDs are expected to be market makers in this segment. Since some difficulties have been experienced in the operation of the exchange traded interest rate futures market, we are now in the process of reviewing the structure so that it can become an active market for interest rate discovery and hedging. Despite the growing volumes in the OTC derivatives market, as is the case globally, there had been some apprehensions regarding the appropriate legal backing for these instruments. This issue has now been addressed with an appropriate amendment to the Reserve Bank of India Act. OTC derivatives are now clearly legally valid, even if they are not traded on any recognised stock exchange. Exchange traded derivatives have their own role to play in the debt market – but by their very nature they have to be standardised products. OTC derivatives, on the other hand can be customised to the requirements of the trading entities. Thus, both OTC and exchange traded derivatives are essential for market development.  A central counter party based clearing arrangement for OTC derivatives would reduce counterparty risk and extend the benefits of netting. Accordingly, in order to strengthen the OTC derivatives market and to mitigate the risks involved, a clearing arrangement for the OTC interest rate derivatives also need to be considered. This measure would strengthen the OTC interest rate derivatives market, and provide greater transparency as need through adequate reporting requirements.  While everywhere in the world, most trading is in the OTC segment, there is no reason why we cannot innovate and have electronic based, order matched trading to have a wider reach and also thereby enhance liquidity in the market. Work is now afoot to provide for an exchange traded system for corporate bonds.  As we make arrangements for the operation of better markets for interest rate discovery, trading and hedging instruments, I would like to stress the need and importance of sound and adequate risk management practices by market participants in the derivatives market. International experience teaches us the need for greater care in handling these instruments. I would expect that the market players not only put in place an appropriate risk management policy and procedures for these products, but would also give equal importance to the skills development of their human resources to handle these instruments and to appreciate the underlying risks. As interest rate derivatives grow, an 8 BIS Review 66/2007 
area which requires attention relate to accounting and disclosures. The relevant standards need to be comprehensive and benchmarked to international standards. Government securities market Following the enactment of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003, from April 2006 onwards, the Reserve Bank is no longer permitted to subscribe to government securities in the primary market. In order to ensure a smooth transition to the new regime, restructuring of current institutional processes has already been initiated (Mohan, 2006a). These steps are helping to achieve the desired integration in the conduct of monetary operations.  In the new milieu, the Reserve Bank may need to carry out greater open market operations (OMO) in the secondary market. Such operations could be qualitatively different from its LAF or MSS operations, which are guided by considerations of liquidity management primarily at the shorter end. The issue is what should be the determining factor for such secondary market operations. Generally, by controlling the short-term interest rate while letting markets determine the rest of the yield curve, the central bank attempts to transmit monetary policy impulses across the yield curve. The sovereign yield curve in turn influences the lending and deposit rates in the economy. Once bank lending gets affected, interest rates impact real variables such as consumption and investment, which in turn impact output and inflation levels. However, the government securities market is yet to emerge fully as a deep and liquid market across different maturities. Given such a state, in the interest of monetary transmission, there is a case for secondary market operation across the yield and maturity spectrum in the government securities market and more so, in the context of RBI’s withdrawal from the primary market. Efforts are being made to improve the retail holding of government securities since the Government securities market still lacks in depth and is dominated by banks and financial institutions often exhibiting uni-directional perceptions about liquidity. To attract retail participation in government securities market, one of the foremost tasks ahead is to create an environment that provides a safe and secure investment avenue for small investors with adequate returns and liquidity. In this context, the RBI is emphasising the provision of demat holding facility for non-institutional retail/small investors for risk mitigation in scrip losses or settlement of deals in the secondary market. Non-competitive bidding has also been introduced since January 2002 for direct access to the primary issues for non-sophisticated investors. As part of its constant endeavour to improve the facilities for trading and settlement in the Government securities market, the Reserve Bank had formally launched, on August 1, 2005, an electronic Order Matching trading module for Government securities on its Negotiated Dealing System (NDS-OM in short). The NDS-OM is an additional facility available to the participants and the participants continue to have the option of using the current reporting and trading platform of the NDS. While the NDS-OM now accounts for a significant share of the total traded volume in government securities, the countrywide, anonymous, screen based, order driven system for trading in government securities introduced in the stock exchanges (NSE, BSE and OTCEI) in January 2003 has continued to suffer from very poor trading volumes, which need to be looked into for revival. Corporate debt market In order to activate the corporate debt market, the government had appointed an expert committee (Chairman: R.H. Patil) to provide directions on how this is to be done (Government of India, 2005). A key point that I would like to emphasise is that learning from the experience of developing the Government securities market, we need to proceed in a measured manner with well thought out appropriate sequencing for developing the corporate debt market. Financial market development involves action on a number of fronts with the key objective, obviously, being to enable the most efficient allocation of resources to the most productive uses and efficient intermediation from savers to investors. In other words, banking development, equity market development, debt market development all go hand in hand. And within the debt market, an efficient Government securities market is essential for price discovery and for providing reliable benchmarks to price corporate bonds off the credit risk free yield curve. The key problem is that for a corporate bond market to function, we need a large number of issuers, a large number of investors and issues of a large size. It may be noted that each of the problems mentioned in respect of corporate bonds has been addressed in the context of development of G-securities market. That goes to show that the problems are not insurmountable but only that it takes BIS Review 66/2007 9 
some time to resolve. But we have just begun and work is now in progress. It is true that the Government securities market took a long time to develop, despite being much simpler. The corporate debt market being much more complex, would require some extra effort to move ahead. In short, we have a long way to go but we have to make a determined effort. V.  Exchange rate policy Our exchange rate policy in recent years has been guided by the broad principles of careful monitoring and management of exchange rates with flexibility, without a fixed target or a pre-announced target or a band, coupled with the ability to intervene if and when necessary, while allowing the underlying demand and supply conditions to determine the exchange rate movements over a period in an orderly way. Subject to this predominant objective, the exchange rate policy is guided by the need to reduce excess volatility, prevent the emergence of destabilising speculative activities, help maintain adequate level of reserves, and develop an orderly foreign exchange market.  The Indian market, like other developing countries markets, is not yet very deep and broad, and can sometimes be characterised by uneven flow of demand and supply over different periods. In this situation, the Reserve Bank of India has been prepared to make sales and purchases of foreign currency in order to even out lumpy demand and supply in the relatively thin forex market and to smoothen jerky movements. However, such intervention is not governed by a predetermined target or band around the exchange rate. As the foreign exchange exposure of the Indian economy expands, the role of such uneven demands can be seen to reduce. With this approach, we have achieved flexibility along with stability in the external sector. Increased earnings from exports of services and remittances coupled with enhanced foreign investment inflows have provided strength to the external sector. Reflecting the strong growth prospects of the Indian economy, the country has received large investment inflows, both direct and portfolio, since 1993-94 as compared with negligible levels till the early 1990s. Total foreign investment flows (direct and portfolio) increased from US$ 111 million in 1990-91 to US$ 24,748 million in 2006-07. Over the same period, current account deficits remained modest – averaging one per cent of GDP since 1991-92 and in fact recorded small surpluses during 2001-04. With capital flows remaining in excess of the current financing requirements, the overall balance of payments recorded persistent surpluses leading to an increase in reserves, which have now reached US$ 1,99,179 million at end-March 2007. The emergence of foreign exchange surplus lending to continuing and large accretion to reserves since the mid 1990s has been a novel experience for India after experiencing chronic balance of payment problems for almost four decades. These surpluses began to arise after the opening of the current account, reduction in trade protection, and partial opening of the capital account from the early to mid 1990s. India’s integration with the world economy is also getting stronger, with implications for the conduct of exchange rate policies in the future. Trade in goods (i.e., exports plus imports) as a proportion of GDP increased from 14.6 per cent in 1990-91 to 32.5 per cent in 2005-06; while gross current account receipts and payments as percentage of GDP increased from 19.4 per cent to 50.2 per cent over the same period, reflecting the buoyant growth in Indian trade in services. The trade deficit is also as high as 6.4 per cent of GDP. Correspondingly, in the capital account, gross flows (total inflows plus outflows) have more than doubled as a proportion of GDP: from 12.1 per cent in 1990-91 to 32.4 per cent (US$ 260 billion) in 2005-06. Thus, the Indian economy is today substantially exposed to the international economy and arguably more open than even the United States in terms of these metrics.  Issues Dutch disease In recent years, the growth in current payments has been accompanied by healthy growth in current receipts – in both goods and services, thus providing for some confidence in the sustainability of current trade patterns and financial stability. Current receipts pay for up to about 90 per cent of current payments. Within current receipts, merchandise exports are being rapidly exceeded in terms of growth rates by software earnings, currently at 2.9 per cent of GDP. Besides, private transfer receipts, comprising mainly remittances from Indians working abroad, seemed to have acquired a permanent character and have risen steadily to constitute around 3 per cent of GDP in recent years, impervious to exchange rate movements. These factors have strengthened the capability of the Indian economy to 10 BIS Review 66/2007 
sustain higher current account deficits (CADs) than in the past. Net capital flows have thus regularly exceeded the CAD requirements by a fair measure, enabling large accretions to the reserves. The large inflow of remittances and major and sustained spurt in software exports coupled with capital inflows have the potential for possible overvaluation of the currency and the resultant erosion of long-term competitiveness of other traditional and goods sectors – popularly known as the Dutch disease. Given the fact that more people are in the goods sector, the human aspects of the exchange rate management should not be lost sight of. Therefore, the Dutch Disease syndrome has so far been managed by way of reserves build-up and sterilisation, the former preventing excessive nominal appreciation and the latter preventing higher inflation. However, the issue remains how long and to what extent such an exchange rate management strategy would work given the fact that we are faced with large and continuing capital flows apart from strengthening current receipts on account of remittances and software exports. This issue has assumed increased importance over the last year with increased capital flows arising from the higher sustained growth performance of the economy and significant enhancement of international confidence in the Indian economy. Liquidity management Volatility in capital flows and hence in liquidity has marked the period during 2001-07 and posed considerable problems in liquidity and exchange rate management. Sharp shifts in capital flows can be explained as partly frictional and arising from seasonal and transient factors, partly cyclical and associated with the pick up in growth momentum and the induced demand for bank credit, and partly led by growth expectation. Moreover, the absorption of external savings is also dependent on the stage of a business cycle that a country may be going through. Further, the stage of business cycle and the timing of capital flows may not coincide. The early years of this decade were characterised by low industrial growth and hence the absorptive capacity of the country was constrained. As we have entered an expansionary phase, the current account has widened and the potential for some greater absorption has manifested itself.  The volatile capital flows have warranted appropriate monetary operations to obviate wide fluctuations in market rates and ensure reasonable stability consistent with the monetary policy stance. In fact, the Indian experience illustrates the tight link between external sector management and domestic monetary management. What may be small movements in capital flows for the rest of the world can translate into large domestic liquidity movements distorting market exchange and interest rates in a developing country. Just as foreign exchange reserves can act as a shock absorber, on the external front, we had to look for a parallel liquidity shock absorber for domestic monetary management.  In this context, a new instrument, named as the Market Stabilisation Scheme (MSS) has evolved as a useful instrument of monetary policy to sustain open market operations. The MSS was made operational from April 2004. Under this scheme, which is meant exclusively for liquidity management, the Reserve Bank has been empowered to issue Government Treasury Bills and medium duration dated securities for the purpose of liquidity absorption. The scheme works by impounding the proceeds of auctions of Treasury bill and Government securities in a separate identifiable MSS cash account maintained and operated by the RBI. The amounts credited into the MSS cash account are appropriated only for the purpose of redemption and / or buy back of the Treasury Bills and / or dated securities issued under the MSS. MSS securities are indistinguishable from normal Treasury Bills and Government dated securities in the hands of the lender. The payments for interest and discount on MSS securities are not made from the MSS Account, but shown in the Union budget and other related documents transparently as distinct components under separate sub-heads. The introduction of MSS has succeeded, in principle, in restoring LAF to its intended function of daily liquidity management. Since its introduction in April 2004, the MSS has served as a very useful instrument for medium term monetary and liquidity management. It has been unwound in times of low capital flows and greater liquidity needs and built up when excess capital flows could lead to excess domestic liquidity. In principle, the MSS is designed to sterilise excess capital flows that are deemed to be durable or semi-durable. In practice this is difficult to discern ex-ante: hence the range of MSS instruments in terms of their duration can effectively modulate the sterilisation on an ex-post basis. Our strategy of introducing this new MSS instrument to manage excess capital flows and reduce volatility in the exchange rate reflects the overall issue of global capital flows that many developing countries are facing, particularly in Asia. Net private flows (equity + debt) have increased from an average of about US$ 180 billion over the five year period 1998 to 2002, to about US$ 650 billion in 2006, amounting to about 5 per cent of their GDP (World Bank, 2007). Absorption of such a volume of flows would imply a corresponding current account deficit of about 5 per cent of GDP. What should be BIS Review 66/2007 11 
the approach to exchange rate determination in such circumstances? To what extent is the current account balance a good guide to evaluation of the appropriate level of an exchange rate? To what extent should the capital account influence the exchange rate? What are the implications of large current account deficits for the real economy? Are they sustainable and, if not, what are the implications for financial stability in developing countries? In India's case, as mentioned, we have almost always had a modest current account deficit though, because of remittances and service exports, the trade deficit has widened significantly in recent years. These are the issues that we have to deal with as we negotiate fuller capital account convertibility, but I believe these are wider questions that are engaging most countries in Asia. Going forward, there will be a continuous need to adapt the strategy of liquidity management as well as exchange rate management for effective monetary management and short-term interest rate smoothening. The key questions we continue to face with are what should be the instruments and modes of management of liquidity in the interest of growth and financial stability and how much should capital flows affect exchange rate. These issues become even more relevant under a freer regime of capital flows. Global developments are expected to have an increasing role in determining the conduct of monetary and exchange rate policies in our countries. In an environment of global convergence, retaining independence of monetary policy may become increasingly difficult, calling for hard choices in terms of goals and instruments.  VI.  Fiscal situation and the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act Some progress Public finances have exhibited a mixed trend in the reforms period. After witnessing some correction till 1996-97, public finances underwent deterioration, reflecting a variety of factors such as the decline in tax revenues (as per cent to GDP) in consonance with the cyclical downturn of economic activity, as well as the effects of the 5th Pay Commission award. Indeed, the combined fiscal deficit of the Centre and States was higher in 2001-02 than that in 1990-91. Since 2002-03 onwards, public finances have witnessed a significant improvement, reflecting both policy efforts at fiscal consolidation as well as the upturn in economic activity (Table 1). A noteworthy development at the federal level is the transformation of state level sales taxes into the Value Added Tax (VAT), which has introduced a large measure of rationality and uniformity in the state tax system. The state sales tax system had also suffered from great complexity in terms of multiplicity of rates and special provisions. A vital feature of this tax reform has been the consultative process among all the states as mediated by the central government, which then resulted in this consensus for massive reform.  Table 1: Combined Deficit Indicators: Centre and States (As per cent of GDP) Year Fiscal Deficit Revenue Deficit Primary Deficit 2001-02  10.0 7.0 3.7 2002-03  9.6 6.6 3.1 2003-04  8.5 5.8 2.1 2004-05  7.5 3.7 1.4 2005-06  7.4 3.1 1.6 2006-07  6.4 2.2 0.8 Source: Reserve Bank of India 12 BIS Review 66/2007 
Issues Notwithstanding the recent correction, combined public debt remains high (almost 79 per cent of GDP at end March 2006). The latest most significant measure taken is the introduction of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBM) in 2004, which enjoins the government to eliminate its revenue deficit and reduce its fiscal deficit to 3 per cent of GDP by 2009. Similar acts have been passed by most state governments (25states so far). So fiscal responsibility has now become part of our legislative commitments. Together, they, however, amount to a total deficit of about six per cent of GDP, which is considered high by global standards.  After the award of the 5th Pay Commission in 1997, public finances had come under strain and hence public savings had become negative. Now the growth process has clearly recovered and we seem to be on a sustainable path of annual GDP growth in excess of 8.5 per cent. The 8.5 per cent plus growth would itself place in demand for higher government wages and the 6th Pay Commission has to come, complicating the fiscal consolidation process. Achieving the FRBM target of zero revenue deficit by 2008-09 requires continued focus on containing expenditures, increase in tax revenues and reduction in tax exemptions. Revenue augmentation would critically depend upon improvement in tax/GDP ratio as non-tax revenue is set to decline in the coming years. In this context, the reversal of the declining trend in tax-GDP ratio is welcome. This increasing trend needs to be maintained through further widening of the tax base and curtailment in tax exemptions. It is in this context that the erosion of tax base on account of various exemptions poses a cause for concern.  With the attainment of a sustainable higher growth path in excess of 8.5 per cent annual real GDP growth, the prospects for continued fiscal consolidation have improved. Tax revenues have become buoyant with continuing healthy growth in corporate profits and personal incomes. Furthermore, the introduction of the value added tax (VAT) system at the state level provides further ground for optimism. What we will need to guard against are the usual demands for exemptions that contribute to erosion of the tax base. An important point to note in relation to the Indian fiscal situation is that, despite the long term persistence of high fiscal deficits by any standards, India has not been subject to banking or financial market turbulence. Our fiscal parameters have not been too different from some of the countries that have experienced the most turbulence, such as Turkey and Argentina. In fact, it is because of our inadequate fiscal performance that India did not have investment grade rating until earlier this year. The main reasons why India has been able to maintain financial stability in the presence of such fiscal stress is that almost all the sovereign debt has been domestic, except for bilateral and multilateral external borrowing, which itself has been small proportionately. India has eschewed sovereign borrowing in external markets, thereby insulating ourselves from external volatility in exchange rates and interest rates. The move to increased market borrowing has also been useful in providing market signals on the cost of borrowing. Finally, coordination between monetary policy, domestic debt management, and financial sector policies in the Reserve Bank and the Government has also helped in this regard.  VII. Strengthening of financial sector/banks The financial system in India, through a measured, gradual, cautious, and steady process, has undergone substantial transformation. It has been transformed into a reasonably sophisticated, diverse and resilient system through well-sequenced and coordinated policy measures aimed at making the Indian financial sector more competitive, efficient, and stable. The overall capital adequacy ratio of the banking sector as a whole has increased from 10.4 per cent at end-March 1997 to 12.3 per cent at end-March 2007.1 The asset quality of the banking sector has recorded a significant improvement: the ratio of net non-performing assets to net advances has declined from 8.1 per cent at end-March 1997 to 2.0 per cent at end-March 2007 despite tightening of NPA classification norms. The profitability of banks as defined by the return on assets increased from 0.7 per cent in 1996-97 to 0.9 per cent in 2006-07. Intermediation cost of banks has declined from 2.9 per cent in 1995-96 to                                                       1  Data for 2006-07 are unaudited and provisional. BIS Review 66/2007 13 
around 2 per cent by 2006-07. The financial system is now robust and resilient, and is enabling accelerated economic growth in an environment of stability. Consistent with the policy approach to benchmark the banking system to the best international standards with emphasis on gradual harmonisation, in a phased manner, all foreign banks operating in India and all Indian commercial banks having foreign operations are required to start implementing Basel II with effect from March 31, 2008, while other commercial banks are required to implement Basel II by March 31, 2009.2 Recognising the differences in degrees of sophistication and development of the banking system, it has been decided that the banks will initially adopt the Standardised Approach for credit risk and the Basic Indicator Approach for operational risk. After adequate skills are developed, both by the banks and also by the supervisors, some of the banks may be allowed to migrate to the Internal Rating Based (IRB) Approach. Although implementation of Basel II will require more capital for banks in India, the cushion available in the system – at present, the Capital to Risk Assets Ratio (CRAR) is over 12 per cent – provides some comfort. In order to provide banks greater flexibility and avenues for meeting the capital requirements, the Reserve Bank has issued policy guidelines enabling issuance of several instruments by the banks viz., innovative perpetual debt instruments, perpetual non-cumulative preference shares, redeemable cumulative preference shares and hybrid debt instruments. The Reserve Bank founded the Board for Financial Supervision (BFS) in 1994 to upgrade its practice of financial supervision of banks. In course of time, development financial institutions, specialised term-lending institutions, non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), urban co-operative banks and primary dealers (PDs) have all been brought under the supervision of the BFS. A set of prudential norms for the commercial banking sector had been instituted as early as 1994 with regard to capital adequacy, income recognition and asset classification, provisioning, exposure norms and more recently, in respect of their investment portfolio. With the aim of regulatory convergence for entities involved in similar activities, prudential regulation and supervision norms were also introduced in phases for DFIs, NBFCs, co-operative banks and PDs.  In tandem with the gradual opening up of the economy, the regulatory and supervisory framework was spruced up comprising of a three-pronged strategy of regular on-site inspections, technology-driven off-site surveillance and extensive use of external auditors. As a result of improvements in the regulatory and supervisory framework, the degree of compliance with the Basel Core Principles has gradually improved. The supervisory framework has been further upgraded with the institution of a framework of Risk-based Supervision (RBS) for intensified monitoring of vulnerabilities. A scheme of Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) was effected in December 2002 to undertake mandatory and discretionary intervention against troubled banks based on well-defined financial/prudential parameters. In view of the growing emergence of financial conglomerates and the possibility of systemic risks arising therefrom, a system of consolidated accounting has been instituted. A half-yearly review based on financial soundness indicators is being undertaken to assess the health of individual institutions and macro-prudential indicators associated with financial system soundness. The findings arising thereof are disseminated to the public through its various Reports. The bankruptcy procedures for containing the level of NPAs have been strengthened over the years. Debt Recovery Tribunals (DRTs) were established consequent to the passing of Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993. With a view to putting in place a mechanism for timely and transparent restructuring of corporate debts of viable entities facing problems, a Scheme of Corporate Debt Restructuring (CDR) was started in 2001 outside the purview of BIFR (i.e., Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction), DRT and other legal proceedings. Similar guidelines on debt restructuring of viable or potentially viable SME units were issued in September 2005. To provide a significant impetus to banks to ensure sustained recovery, the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest (SARFAESI) Act was passed in 2002 and was subsequently amended to ensure creditor rights. With a view to increasing the options available to banks for dealing with NPAs, guidelines were also issued on sale/ purchase of NPAs in July 2005. Subsequently, a few Asset Reconstruction Companies have been registered. Thus, the bankruptcy procedures for recovery of bad debts have been streamlined over the years even though the Sick Industrial Companies Act (SICA) continues to be in vogue.                                                        2  They have, however, the option of implementing Basel II with effect from March 31, 2008 as well. 14 BIS Review 66/2007 
A further challenge for policy in the context of fuller capital account openness will be to preserve the financial stability of the system as greater deregulation is done on capital outflows and on debt inflows. This will require market development, enhancement of regulatory capacity in these areas, as well as human resource development in both financial intermediaries and non-financial entities. In consonance with the objective of enhancing efficiency and productivity of banks through greater competition – from new private sector banks and entry and expansion of several foreign banks – there has been a consistent decline in the share of public sector banks in total assets of commercial banks. Notwithstanding such transformation, the public sector banks still account for nearly 70 per cent of assets and income. Public sector banks have also responded to the new challenges of competition, as reflected in their increased share in the overall profit of the banking sector. This suggests that, with operational flexibility, public sector banks are competing relatively effectively with private sector and foreign banks. Public sector bank managements are now probably more attuned to the market consequences of their activities (Mohan, 2006a). But it is also they who face the most difficult challenges in human resource development. They will have to invest very heavily in skill enhancement at all levels: at the top level for new strategic goal setting; at the middle level for implementing these goals; and at the cutting edge lower levels for delivering the new service modes. Wide disparities exist within the banking sector as far as technological capabilities are concerned: the percentage of “computer literate” employees as percentage of total staff in 2000 was around 20 per cent in public sector banks compared with 100 per cent in new private and around 90 per cent in foreign banks (Reserve Bank of India, 2002). Data reported by the RBI suggests that nearly 71 per cent of branches of public sector banks are fully computerised. However, computerisation needs to go beyond the mere “arithmeticals”, to borrow a term from the Report of the Committee on Banking Sector Reforms (Government of India, 1998), and instead, needs to be leveraged optimally to achieve and maintain high service and efficiency standards. Given the average age of 45 years plus for employees in the public sector banks, they will also face new recruitment challenges in the face of adverse compensation structures in comparison with the freer private sector. The issue of mixed ownership as an institutional structure where government has controlling interest is a salient feature of bank governance in India. Such aspects of corporate governance in public sector banks is important, not only because public sector banks dominate the banking industry, but also because, it is likely that they would continue to remain in banking business. To the extent there is public ownership of public sector banks, the multiple objectives of the government as owner and the complex principal-agent relationships needs to be taken on board. Over the reform period, more and more public sector banks have begun to get listed on the stock exchange, which, in its wake, has led to greater market discipline and concomitantly, to an improvement in their governance aspects as well. The broadbased and diversified ownership of public sector banks has brought about a qualitative difference in their functioning, since there is induction of private shareholding as well as attendant issues of shareholder’s value, as reflected by the market capitalisation, board representation and interests of minority shareholders. Given the increased technical complexity of most business activities including banking and the rapid pace of change in financial markets and practices, public sector banks would need to devise imaginative ways of responding to the evolving challenges within the context of mixed ownership. Another aspect of greater capital market openness concerns the presence of foreign banks in India. The Government and Reserve Bank outlined a roadmap on foreign investment in banks in India in February 2005, which provides guidelines on the extent of their presence until 2009. This roadmap is consistent with the overall guidelines issued simultaneously on ownership and governance in private sector banks in India. The presence of foreign banks in the country has been very useful in bringing greater competition in certain segments in the market. They are significant participants in investment banking and in development of the forex market. With the changes that have taken place in the United States and other countries, where the traditional barriers between banking, insurance and securities companies have been removed, the size of the largest financial conglomerates has become extremely large. Between 1995 and 2004, the size of the largest bank in the world has grown three-fold by asset size, from about US $ 0.5 trillion to US $ 1.5 trillion, about one and a half times the size of Indian GDP. This has happened through a great degree of merger activity: for example, J.P. Morgan Chase is the result of mergers among 550 banks and financial institutions. The ten biggest commercial banks in the US now control almost half of that country's banking assets, up from 29 per cent just 10 years ago (Economist, 2006). Hence, with fuller capital account convertibility and greater presence of foreign banks over time, a number of issues will arise. First, if these large global banks have emerged as a result of real economies of scale and scope, how will smaller national banks compete in countries like India, and will they themselves need to generate a larger international presence? Second, there is BIS Review 66/2007 15 
considerable discussion today on overlaps and potential conflicts between home country regulators of foreign banks and host country regulators: how will these be addressed and resolved in the years to come? Third, given that operations in one country such as India are typically small relative to the global operations of these large banks, the attention of top management devoted to any particular country is typically low. Consequently, any market or regulatory transgressions committed in one country by such a bank, which may have a significant impact on banking or financial market of that country, is likely to have negligible impact on the bank's global operations. It has been seen in recent years that even relatively strong regulatory action taken by regulators against such global banks has had negligible market or reputational impact on them in terms of their stock price or similar metrics. Thus, there is loss of regulatory effectiveness as a result of the presence of such financial conglomerates. Hence, there is inevitable tension between the benefits that such global conglomerates bring and some regulatory and market structure and competition issues that may arise. Along with the emergence of international financial conglomerates we are also witnessing similar growth of Indian conglomerates. As in most countries, the banking, insurance and securities companies each come under the jurisdiction of their respective regulators. A beginning has been made in organised cooperation between the regulators on the regulation of such conglomerates, with agreement on who would be the lead regulator in each case. In the United States, it is a financial holding company that is at the core of each conglomerate, with each company being its subsidiary. There is, as yet, no commonality in the financial structure of each conglomerate in India: in some the parent company is the banking company; whereas in others there is a mix of structure. For Indian conglomerates to be competitive, and for them to grow to a semblance of international size, they will need continued improvement in clarity in regulatory approach. VIII.  Concluding remarks I have described at length the evolution of India's macroeconomic and monetary management over the last decade and a half to demonstrate the complexity of such management in the context of a developing economy that manages its opening up to the rest of the world in a gradual manner. Monetary policy and exchange rate regimes have necessarily to be operated as fuzzy or intermediate regimes not obeying the almost received wisdom of purist approaches. The judgement on the legitimacy of such a regime must be based on their efficacy as revealed by the outcomes. On this count, I believe that India's macroeconomic, monetary and financial managers can justifiably claim a reasonable degree of success: economic growth is high and accelerating; inflation has shifted to lower sustainable levels; savings and investments are growing; financial markets have been growing and developing in an orderly manner; the health of the banking system has improved continuously and is approaching best practice standards; the external account is healthy in the presence of robust trade growth in both goods and services; and increasing capital flows indicate growing international confidence in the Indian economy; and the Indian exchange rate has been flexible in both directions providing for reasonable market determination, in the presence of central bank forex interventions. These are the achievements of the past. As we ascend to a higher growth path, and as we have fuller capital account convertibility, we will face newer challenges and will have to continue to adapt. The key point is that with greater capital account openness, we have to develop markets such that market participants, financial and non financial, are enabled to cope better with market fluctuations. As we do this, we need to be cognizant of the vast range of capabilities of different market participants in as diverse a country as India: from subsistent farmers to the most sophisticated financial market practitioners.

Paul Tucker: Central banking and political economy – the example of the UK’s Monetary Policy Committee Speech by Mr Paul Tucker, Executive Director and Member of the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England, at the Inflation Targeting, Central Bank Independence and Transparency Conference, Cambridge, 15 June 2007. *      *      * Over the next couple of days, this conference will take forward debates on many of the strategy issues preoccupying monetary economists and policy practitioners. The role of inflation targets and communication in anchoring inflation expectations. The place of money in central bank analysis and policy frameworks. Whether to be transparent about any expectations policymakers form about the path of their policy rate. After more than a decade in which monetary authorities across the world have generally succeeded in maintaining price stability, it is hard to know whether these continuing debates – and, more important, the variations in central bank practices that underlie them – are vital or peripheral. Time will tell. Some architectural features of monetary regimes are plainly important and, unsurprisingly, are broadly shared: central bank independence; a definition of price stability that, with credibility, can act as a nominal anchor; a forward-looking “reaction function”. Within that broad canvas, the remaining variance in central bank practice may owe something to differences in the governance structure for their decision taking, and to the genesis of those differences. Alan Blinder has deftly set out1 a spectrum of decision taking structures ranging from one individual, the Governor; through committees that are more or less collegial, with either a clear leader or a more collective approach; to committees, such as the Bank of England’s MPC, that are individualistic. Blinder and others identify advantages in a committee approach of some kind, essentially on the grounds, based on analysis or experiment,2 that committees will generally make better decisions. That may leave out something rather important. Which is that in some countries a committee structure has been a pre-condition for achieving central bank independence in the first place. And that is a useful reminder of the political economy conditions in which monetary regimes are constituted and operate. Context matters, including possibly to some of the issues on your conference agenda. The UK’s post-war journey to monetary credibility illustrates that rather neatly. Environmental preconditions for independence: ideas and values For a long time, price stability simply was not the core objective of macroeconomic policy. A Bank of England piece in the late 1960s3 described government’s twin goals as having been to improve trend growth and maintain high employment, to which was subsequently added balance of payments sustainability. When, in the mid-1970s, the UK suffered the indignity of having to borrow from the IMF, the Cabinet split over the Fund’s stability-oriented programme.4 And the Thatcher government, elected shortly afterwards, failed to command broad-based support for a medium-term framework for reducing inflation explicitly founded on “monetarism”, which became a loaded term, widely perceived across UK society as part of an ideology. In other words, sound money or price stability was not viewed as an objective that could be shared across the democratic political spectrum.5                                                      1  See Chapter 2 in Blinder, A.

This was, perhaps, apparent in the famous 1981 letter of the 364 economists which stressed that “the time has come to reject monetarist policies”.6 Whatever the merits or demerits of its conjunctural points, the letter made no mention of an objective of low and stable inflation, or of the fiscal sustainability that is a precondition for monetary stability. Indeed, it is striking that, in this country, price stability was not energetically promoted by the mainstream academy. Rather, the case was made by what seems to have been a relatively small group of public intellectuals,7 together with a few academics and officials. Drawing on the work of US macroeconomists, UK policymakers reached four broad conclusions that have endured: that macroeconomic policy should not assume that there was a long-term trade off between inflation and output; that microeconomic policy should be assigned the task of improving the supply side of the economy; that only monetary policy could achieve and maintain price stability; and that medium-term fiscal discipline was needed for any monetary regime to be credible.8 Elements of that were controversial at the time. And views within the official sector on the acceptable rate of inflation covered a broad spectrum. By the early-mid 1980s, some were apparently prepared to settle for inflation of around 5%, or at least were concerned about the output costs of further disinflation. Others, notably Eddie George, argued that inflationary expectations could be stabilised effectively only if inflation were lowered below that.9 Whilst affirming a commitment to reduce inflation further,10 politicians did not resolve these debates by articulating a medium-term goal for inflation. Money was believed to be more controllable than inflation so, during this period, objectives, targets/indicators and instruments tended to be considered together, a monetary target being expected to deliver all three. Ministers were, in consequence, drawn into highly technical debates, rather than focusing primarily on articulating high-level macroeconomic objectives. But both money targeting and, subsequently, exchange-rate targeting failed in the UK. That meant that attempts by politicians to deliver effective monetary policy by binding themselves to a policy rule based on an intermediate target had failed. So attention gradually turned to broader institutional solutions, leading ultimately to “operational independence” for the Bank. In terms of the political economy, there were perhaps two crucial developments during the first half of the 1990s. First, there was much greater transparency. An inflation target was announced by government, making the objective clear and performance in achieving it easy to monitor. The Bank’s analysis of the inflation outlook was published in the quarterly Inflation Report; and its advice to the Chancellor on the level of interest rates was published in the minutes of the “Ken and Eddie Show”. This revolution helped to establish the legitimacy of what the monetary authorities were trying to achieve; helped to demonstrate the Bank’s competence; and showed that differences of view about the level of interest rates could be disclosed without the ceiling coming down. Second, a lot more was done, by the Bank and others, to establish support for the goal of price stability – not as a political tenet but as a technical prerequisite for a well-functioning economy. This ran through the speeches of Robin Leigh-Pemberton, Eddie George and Mervyn King in the late 1980s and early 1990s, as well as in Bank research. Analytically, energised by the current Governor when Chief Economist, the Bank put resources into analysing the costs of inflation, and into contributing to the so-called time-consistency literature on the central importance of mechanisms to underpin trust in a monetary authority’s declared commitments.11 And in more public spheres, Eddie George’s speeches in the early 1990s repeatedly stressed the emergence of a consensus, domestically and internationally, about macroeconomic policy goals and means. Price stability was not                                                       6  See Letter to The Times from 364 Academic Economists, April 1981. 7  Notably Samuel Brittan and Peter Jay. See, for example, Sir Samuel Brittan’s 1981 paper “How to end the “monetarist” controversy: a journalists reflections on output, jobs, prices and money”, London: IEA. 8  See Lawson, N., 1984, “The British Experiment”, The Fifth Mais Lecture at City University Business School, June. 9  These differences of emphasis emerged during the review of macroeconomic policy objectives and instruments discussed in Chapter 36 of Lord Lawson’s book “A View from Number Eleven”. 10  See Nigel Lawson’s 1984 Mais Lecture, op. cit.. 11  In 1992, Governor Leigh-Pemberton gave a lecture entitled: “The case for price stability”. As well as reviewing the costs of inflation, the lecture reprised the early-1980s debate on the rate of inflation the authorities should settle for (see Note 9), in a section entitled “Why not settle for 5%?”. These issues were also the centrepiece of the Bank’s tercentenary conference in 1994 on the future of central banking. See Fischer, S, “Modern Central Banking”, in Capie F., C. Goodhart, S. Fischer and N. Schnadt (eds.), 1994, The Future of Central Banking: The Tercentenary Symposium of the Bank of England, Cambridge University Press. See also Briault, C., 1995, “The costs of inflation”, Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, February. And Haldane, A. (ed.), 1995, Targeting Inflation: a conference of central banks on the use of inflation targets organised by the Bank of England, March. 2 BIS Review 66/2007 
just an end in itself but a precondition for macroeconomic stability more generally: for sustainable growth in output and employment and, thus, for the “good things in life”. A precondition, but not a sufficient condition. The Bank took care to stress that, however effective, monetary policy could not deliver economic prosperity on its own. It was a necessary condition. And it could avoid the costs of inflation, including random and unacceptable redistributions of wealth between savers and borrowers resulting from unexpected surges in inflation caused by the authorities choosing to loosen monetary conditions. Two observations might be made about the case the Bank was making. First, there is a conviction that the long-term health of the real economy is affected by the monetary regime. In the jargon, money neutrality but not “superneutrality” which, put broadly, holds that monetary regimes are irrelevant to the long-run performance of the real economy.12 The way I think about this is that low and stable inflation can bring two (related) benefits to the real economy. Relative price signals will be clearer, aiding the efficient allocation of resources. And greater macroeconomic stability will reduce risk, reflected in lower risk premia and so in a lower effective cost of capital for firms and households, as well as possibly in longer investment horizons. Second, some of the arguments might have seemed to shade into a “moral” case for price stability, which has recently been excoriated by Willem Buiter13 on the grounds that it has typically come packaged with central bankers presenting themselves as akin to spiritual leaders who are above needing to explain their actions to the public. Well, I don’t think we had much truck with central banking as religion, and from the early 1990s the Bank could reasonably claim to have been in the vanguard of transparency. But there did run through our corridors a sense of outrage that homes, livelihoods and businesses could be destroyed by quite unnecessary lurches from boom to bust; and that the economy’s progress was being arrested by the lack of sustained and credible nominal stability. In other words, central bankers seemed not to believe research results suggesting that the welfare benefits of macroeconomic stabilisation were small.14 Caring passionately about the benefits of price stability is part of what makes us – a bunch of “conservative central bankers”15 – suitable for the job. Environmental conditions for independence: institutions One might think that would be it; that independence would follow from a consensus being established around those ideas and values. Not at all, and for good reasons in the UK context. I recall16 various arguments being advanced through the 1980s and into the 1990s against independence for the Bank. Mostly, they had their roots in the Bank comprising unelected officials, without a democratically elected minister as its head. Thus, the then Governor was told in the very early 1990s that if the Bank ever combined responsibility for bank supervision with monetary policy it would be “an overmighty citizen”. More important, a number of commentators argued that it was a real obstacle to independence that                                                       12  O. Blanchard and S. Fisher in “Lectures on Macroeconomics”, MIT Press 1989, state that “money is said to be neutral if changes in the level of nominal money have no effect on the real equilibrium. It is said to be superneutral if changes in money growth have no effect on the real equilibrium.” (note 8, page 207). Given the relationship between money growth and inflation in the very long run, that means that the rate of inflation has no effect on the real equilibrium. In practice, high rates of inflation have proved highly variable, injecting uncertainty into the economy, which can have real effects. 13  Buiter, W. H., 2006, “How Robust is the New Conventional Wisdom in Monetary Policy?

the Bank would not be able to account for its monetary stewardship on the Floor of the House of Commons. In a Parliamentary system of democracy, it is Ministers who are accountable.17Those circumstances are specific to the UK. Other conditions and histories act as constraints elsewhere. For example, in Germany, the institution that became the highly independent Bundesbank was established as part of the country’s reconstruction after WWII and so before its new democracy was embedded. It had “goal independence”. And in the US, while there is hesitation over giving the Federal Reserve an inflation target, as great weight is placed by Congress on the “dual mandate”, there is not concern about the scope or mechanics of the FOMC’s accountability to Congress. Every member of the executive arm of the government is unelected except the President. The central bank is no outlier.18 But in the UK it really was a novelty – in a way, a constitutional departure, foreshadowed perhaps only by the judiciary19 – to give such a politically sensitive lever to a body of unelected technicians. The institutional obstacles to Bank of England “independence” therefore needed institutional solutions. Responsibility for bank regulation was transferred from the Bank in 1997. The pathway to resolution of the “democratic deficit” problem had potentially been opened up in the 1980s by the St John Stevas reforms of Parliamentary Committees which led, over time, to a Treasury Committee with a high reputation and standing, supported by access to expert advice. In the 1997 reforms, the sphere of politics was carefully delineated. The goal of price stability is set by Parliament in legislation; and, within that framework, the Chancellor of the day sets the Bank its target for inflation. So the democratically elected executive arm of government is accountable to Parliament for the policy regime; and the Bank is accountable to the government and to the Parliamentary Select Committee for its operation of that regime. Hence, “operational independence”, not goal independence. The goal was chosen to be a symmetric point inflation target, providing reassurance to the country that the Bank would not pursue a bias towards disinflation. And the credibility of the regime was underpinned by a framework for fiscal policy designed, amongst other things, to maintain a prudent debt/GDP ratio, and so avoid making inflation a tempting prospect down the road. There was one other, vital element of the system’s design, also addressing the problem of interest rates being decided by unelected officials at the Bank. As Eddie George and Mervyn King have now both disclosed, in the run up to the May 1997 election, the Bank pulled together its thoughts on a possible new monetary regime.20 The Bank’s hope was that it might be granted independence if a Committee established to advise the Chancellor on interest rates, which had featured in the Labour Party Manifesto, was seen to do a good job. In the event, the incoming government did not need the intermediate stage of an advisory committee. It created the MPC. The appointment to the Committee of four outside experts ensured that daylight would be brought into the Bank, and underlined the architectural role of democratically elected ministers.21 It also meant that the Committee would reach its decisions on a “one person/one vote” basis, with that going for the five Bank executive members too.                                                       17  Thus, a whole chapter of Lord Roll’s pamphlet on the case for independence was devoted to solutions to this problem. “Independent and accountable: a new mandate for the Bank of England”, report of an independent panel chaired by Eric Roll, Centre for Economic Policy Research, 1993. 18 In another example, Ulrich Kohli has discussed how the SNB’s consensual approach to monetary policy making is “to do with” the culture flowing from Switzerland’s multi-cantonal federal political structure. See Kohli, U., 2005, Comment on “The monetary policy committee and the incentive problem: a selective survey” by Fujiki, H., at conference on “Incentive Mechanisms for Economic Policymakers”, Institute for Monetary and Economic Studies, Bank of Japan, May. 19  The parallel with the judiciary was made in the early 1990s in a speech by Governor Leigh-Pemberton, drawing on work by Ralph Dahrendorf. 20  See transcript of interview on 1 May 2007 of Mervyn King by C. Giles and S. Daneshku for the The Financial Times on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the Bank of England’s operational independence (published 11 May 2007); and transcript of interview on 30 March 2007 of Lord George by C. Giles and S. Daneshku for the The Financial Times on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the Bank of England’s operational independence (published 4 May 2007). As a further gloss on that piece of history, I should perhaps disclose that, working to Eddie, Mervyn and the then DG , Howard Davies, I was the Bank official who “held the pen” during that work. 21  As stated in Balls, E and G. O’Donnell, 2002, Reforming Britain’s Economic and Financial Policy, “The role of the Chancellor in appointing the four outsiders was part of the delicate constitutional balance that was struck in a move towards a legitimate model of central bank independence consistent with British-style accountability to Parliament.” (page 99) 4 BIS Review 66/2007 
This is what I have been leading up to: an “individualistic” committee was a necessary condition for operational independence in the UK. In terms of solving the time-consistency problem and establishing credibility, the UK system does not rely on handing monetary policy, lock, stock and barrel, to a group of “conservative central bankers”; in terms of the literature familiar to this conference, the system is as much Walsh as Rogoff.22 The regime is based on combining an objective set by democratically elected politicians, with clear accountability mechanisms. One of those mechanisms was triggered for the first time recently when CPI inflation rose to 3.1% in March, requiring the Governor, on behalf of the Committee, to write an open letter to the Chancellor about what we thought was going on and what we planned to do to get inflation back to our target of 2%. As well as providing transparency to commentators and the markets who are in the business of forming views about our future actions, the letter has proved a useful focus for public debate, which has almost universally underlined UK society’s continuing commitment to price stability. The “open letter” mechanism is important to the political economy of monetary policy in the UK. A one member/one vote committee The open letter was an instance of the MPC acting as a collective, represented by the Governor. Much of the time, most obviously when reaching our monthly decisions on Bank Rate, we are in one person/one vote mode. Although now well established, a committee that truly adheres to one person/one vote, and at the same time pursues its mandate with dedication and integrity, needs nurturing and skilful maintenance. After all, four of the MPC’s nine members also have executive duties for which they report to the Governor of the day. And the four other, “external” members expect to renew their careers outside central banking after a few years of service to the MPC, and so might be thought to have an interest in maintaining an appropriate profile. But – maybe alone amongst central banks, I’m not sure – no one doubts that the MPC does decide Bank Rate by a free vote. That this should be so owes a great deal to the culture of the Committee itself; a culture engendered by its first Chairman and his successor as Governor, but also by the rest of the membership. This is buttressed by the way in which the Bank’s Court of nonexecutive directors approaches its statutory responsibility of reviewing the MPC’s processes, involving annual bilateral meetings with each MPC member. And, externally, it is similarly underpinned by the Treasury Select Committee holding us individually accountable for our monthly votes, which are published as part of the minutes of our meetings. This establishes very powerful incentives for each member to reach their own considered view. There is no free-riding in the MPC; and our policy debates are full and free. That lies at the very heart of the MPC’s operation, performance and communications. Indeed, it might be wondered whether the tone of some of the public scrutiny could set up incentives to cast minority votes with the aim of demonstrating independence of thought and action.23 That, of course, would be perverse. Each member wants their individual decisions to matter – to the current Bank Rate, and to the expected path of policy and so the monetary conditions embodied in the money market yield curve. One votes in a minority when one disagrees with the immediate decision and the strategy it might convey. Occasionally, doing so, with the reasons disclosed in the minutes, can be an effective way of influencing monetary conditions. The make-up of the MPC’s majorities and minorities shifts around over time. There are no “blocs” on the Committee. And there is no distinction between “internals” and “externals” in that respect. Indeed, apart from the defining characteristic that the internals have full-time executive responsibilities at the Bank, the main distinction to date is that internal members tend to serve for longer; an average of around five and three quarter years, compared with just over three years for the external members.24                                                       22  Walsh, C. E., 1995, “Optimal contracts for central bankers”, American Economic Review, volume 85, number 1, sets out how a contract between government and the monetary authority can give the latter the incentive to pursue society’s macroeconomic goals in a time-consistent manner. Rogoff’s “conservative central banker” relies on the central bank being more averse to inflation than society as a whole. 23  See Gerlach-Kristen, P., 2003, “Insiders and outsiders at the Bank of England”, Central Banking, volume 24, number 1. 24  To date, the time on the Committee served by externals has ranged from a minimum of 1.4 years to a maximum of 8.9 years. For internals, the corresponding range is from 2.25 years to 11 years. These ranges are calculated by including the BIS Review 66/2007 5 
That seems to me to be consonant with the political economy considerations behind the design of the Committee. The internal members provide a bedrock of accumulated policy expertise and commitment. The externals, coming from outside the Bank and turning over more frequently, keep the debate and the process fresh. Three issues around the communication of monetary strategy Against that background, how does the MPC’s constitution, and in particular our one person/one vote decision-making structure, affect our approach to some of the issues on your conference agenda? Communication of decisions: how individualistic should we be? The MPC has employed four main communication mechanisms: the announcement of our monthly decision on Bank Rate; the minutes of those meetings, including details of our individual votes; the quarterly Inflation Report, containing projections for output and inflation; and public testimony, to Parliament and via speeches, interviews etc. This differs in various respects from the practice of some other, more consensual central banks.25 For example, we do not routinely include an explanatory statement in the notice of our monthly decision, preferring to do so only when Bank Rate changes or when we judge that the reasons for a “no change” decision cannot wait until the minutes are published a fortnight later. And when we do include an explanatory statement, it is kept as short and simple as possible. That is obviously different from the ECB and, in degree, from the FOMC. These choices reflect different circumstances and structures; in the MPC’s case, our “one person/one vote” governance. I can assure that members of the committee, including the chairman, do not know what we will decide until it is decided. Ours is not a system that lends itself to the tabling of a draft statement around which views will coalesce. Rather, any statement has to be crafted to reflect the view of the majority that emerged at that particular meeting, not an easy task at speed. We are, in fact, very conscious of the distinction between collective and individual statements. We try to be clear about which communications are collective, on behalf of a majority or the Committee as a whole, and which are made by an individual member speaking for themselves. The Inflation Report projections, for example, represent a “best collective view” or centre of gravity in the Committee, admittedly not a well defined term. Individual views, when departing from that best collective view, have occasionally been published. At the Inflation Report press conference, the Governor, Charlie Bean and I are speaking for the Committee, not for ourselves. By contrast, we speak as individuals when we give testimony to Parliament or set out our views in speeches. That this should be understood is, of course, terribly important given that the effectiveness of the regime depends on the Committee decisions and “policy reaction function” that emerge from our individual deliberations. Conscious of the need to maintain a delicate balance between centripetal and centrifugal forces, most past and current members – including me – have opposed incorporating individually labelled paragraphs into the minutes. To do so would put beyond doubt each month where each of us stands, but it would also affect the dynamic interactions amongst Committee members. My reluctance to go down that route stems from a concern that we would slip towards a degree of individualism where members were no longer listening to each other. It would not be possible for members to polish their statements after the meeting, as they would then be able to tweak their text, ever so slightly of course, in the light of the market reaction to our decision and so on. So highly polished statements would be brought to the meeting, with perhaps even a degree of competition in the depth of the analysis or the beauty of the prose. But the very point of a committee is that we should listen to each other, and then make up our own minds.26 That includes trying to persuade one’s                                                                                                                                                                       unexpired parts of the terms of existing Committee members, but do not include the terms of Howard Davies and David Walton. 25  For example, Weber, A., 2007, “Monetary policy strategy and communication”, speech at the Deutsche Bundesbank/Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland conference on “Monetary policy strategy: old issues and new challenges”, Frankfurt, May 2007. 26  See section on “Does discussion help?” in Lombardelli, Proudman and Talbot, op. cit., page 199. 6 BIS Review 66/2007 
colleagues. Over the years,27 I have definitely seen occasions where individual members have altered their position during the course of a meeting. In summary, the political economy case for one person/one vote does not entail the equivalent of postal voting, which I believe would impair the quality of our discussions and so, probably, of our decisions. Communication of the Committee’s reaction function: whether to publish an expected path of Bank Rate Central bankers know that expectations matter. So they know that delivering their goals requires more than being able to set the overnight money market rate from one policy meeting to the next. It matters where agents – businesses, households, financial markets – expect the policy rate to be set in the future. More than that, it matters that agents have a broad understanding of how the monetary authority will react to unforeseen developments in the economy; their “reaction function”. That being so, some central banks have started publishing their expected future path of rates, or a range for the future path. This could have advantages. For example, absent a clear agreement and statement of the strategy being pursued by the Committee, differences amongst members about the monthly decision can occasionally stem from judgments about how the precise timing of Bank Rate changes would affect perceptions of the Committee’s future course and so monetary conditions. But in my book, there are two reasons for not publishing a planned policy path – both related to the political economy context in which the MPC operates. First, in a one person/one vote system, I very much doubt that a sufficiently stable majority could be relied upon to exist to vote, as a majority, for the entire future path of rates (and then to stick to it if conditions had not changed). And I am not convinced that communication would be aided by publishing a path made up of segments supported by majorities comprising different groups of members. In those circumstances, it would be hard to make sense of how individual statements related to the supposedly collective expected path. Second, any such statements would be conditional on a whole host of judgments about what was going on in the economy and about how the economy works. I doubt that, in the UK, our communication with the public and Parliament would be judged a success if we announced a path, only to have to explain that we had departed from it because conditioning assumptions A, B …. or X and Z had been invalidated by the passage of time. Getting across the conditionality might be hard, but also very important: there could be disquiet if the public felt that it had been misled. There is a premium, in our polity, of keeping the debate focused on the outlook for inflation. As I have said to the Select Committee,28 I would not myself say “never”. I think we must learn from experience elsewhere. But that does not mean sitting on our hands. The real need is to convey our reaction function, which publishing a path for Bank Rate would not obviously accomplish. We need to communicate how we are likely to react to the different types of shock that can drive the economy away from its steady state path. A complete specification is not feasible. We do not have a 100% correct model of the economy. And policy cannot sensibly be described by a simple mechanical rule but, rather, is determined by the judgment of policy makers, with the composition of the one person/one vote committee evolving over time. But at any particular time, some possible shocks – and so sources of risk to the inflation outlook – seem more important than others. As the Governor has announced,29 the MPC is therefore planning to do more to explain our collective assessment of risks.                                                       27 Before I was a member of the MPC, I was on the secretariat, so I have attended nearly every MPC meeting since 1997. 28  See response to question 285 in oral evidence to the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee inquiry on “the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England: Ten years On”, April 2007. 29  King, M. A. 2007, “The MPC ten years on”, lecture to the Society of Business Economists, May. BIS Review 66/2007 7 
Communications about the transmission mechanism, and the place of money within it  Grasping our reaction function requires an understanding of how we think the economy works. In its early years, the MPC published a collective document on the monetary transmission mechanism.30 And, as part of its evidence to the Select Committee’s “Ten Years On” enquiry, we recently submitted a collective document on how the economy has developed over the past decade.31Much of it is uncontroversial. One issue has, though, come to the fore recently: money. Money is a good example of how the political economy context affects the outward form of policy regimes. In the euro area, it was vital for the ECB to do what it could to inherit the credibility of the Bundesbank, and so it was understandable that the special place of money in the Buba’s communication strategy was adopted by the ECB. I had first hand evidence of this when I was a member of the Monetary Policy Sub-Committee of the EMI during the mid-late 1990s (and so before the UK had decided not to join EMU). A colleague from one of the national central banks said to me after one of the deliberations, “Of course you guys have the better arguments about monetary strategy, but we will back the Bundesbank. Their policy record has been outstanding for a quarter of a century. Yours has been good since 1992, around five years, which just isn’t long enough”. In the UK, it was almost the other way round given the series of failed attempts to base monetary policy on a money target during the 1980s. Not only in terms of the substance but also in terms of building and maintaining support for the regime, the UK has been much better served by an objective expressed in terms of a target for inflation. It is easier to explain. But that leaves open the question of what role money should play in our analysis. Some commentators want money to be important in the transmission mechanism because, after all, inflation is a monetary phenomenon; others feel that it can be placed to one side on the grounds that it is essentially endogenous and, after all, the dual of the quantity of money – interest rates – is in our models (more or less). This is an area where, given our individualistic governance structure, views on the Committee cannot be expected to be monolithic. My own view is that it is useful to recover the concept of shifts in the supply of broad money.32 But such shifts do not have much in common with the proverbial helicopter drop; households and firms are not forced to hold the extra money, but respond to the terms and conditions on deposits offered by banks. The consequences for the macroeconomic outlook therefore depend on the nature of the underlying shock. For example, if a shock – say to the monetary regime – caused perceptions of macroeconomic risk to decline, there could plausibly be shifts in both the supply of and demand for credit. Other things being equal, bank balance sheets – and so broad money – would expand, but it might be hard to judge the extent of any inflationary impulse coming through a “shock” to the supply of broad money over and above that stemming from a relaxation in credit constraints and higher asset prices. Also, although a “counterparts” approach to the monetary aggregates would incline one to think that shocks to the supply of credit would flow into broad money, changes in the “technology” of banking and financial intermediation might in some conditions make the connection tenuous. After all, the intermediation of credit occurs via capital markets and not just across bank balance sheets. That could matter, for example, if an increase in the supply of credit happened to occur at much the same time as an increase in incentives or the means for banks to securitise – ie sell – the loans they originate. In the limiting case, a big positive shock to the supply of credit could coincide with shrinking bank balance sheets and so negative broad money growth. That is, of course, not at all what we have seen recently.33 But the thought experiment underlines two things. First, we need to attend carefully to the underlying drivers. As part of that effort, the Bank has recently launched a new Credit Conditions Survey, which should enrich our grasp of what is going on. Reflecting changes in the structure of the financial system, we have included questions on demand for                                                       30  “The transmission mechanism of monetary policy”, a paper by the Monetary Policy Committee, April 1999. 31  “The Bank of England’s submission regarding the economic context”, memorandum submitted in evidence to the Treasury Select Committee inquiry on “The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England: Ten years On”, April 2007. 32  See Goodhart, C. A. E., 2007, “Whatever Became of the Monetary Aggregates?”, Peston Lecture at Queen Mary College, London, and King M. A. K., 2007, “The MPC ten years on”, lecture to the Society of Business Economists, May. 33  See Tucker, P. M. W., 2006, “Macro, asset price and financial system uncertainties”, Roy Bridge Memorial Lecture to the ACI – The Financial Markets Association, Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, Spring 2007, page 127 for discussion on growth in financial sector money holdings, and page 129 for discussion of the composition of balance sheets of large banks. 8 BIS Review 66/2007 
credit from hedge funds and structured finance vehicles, as well as on the terms and conditions on bank lending to households and firms. Second, we need to be careful in distinguishing the implications of credit conditions and asset prices from any extra role played by the rate of growth in banking sector liabilities (broad money). It is plausible that we are capturing all that we need to via the incorporation of asset prices – and so, at one remove, credit conditions – in mainstream macreconomic models and analysis. But we cannot be sure, not least because banking intermediation does not feature in those models, and now do risk premia. As I have said before,34 we must look at money, as it can be an “amber light”, but analysis of the monetary aggregates, which means the analysis of the banking sector balance sheet, often needs to be especially detailed. Sitting at the juncture of the real and financial economies, central banks should be especially well placed to undertake that analysis. To be clear, those are my individual views. Our governance structure provides constructive incentives for each of us to reveal our views on issues of this kind – to each other, and in public. Conclusion Much of the world economy has been enjoying a period of sustained macroeconomic stability. Reforms under a series of governments to enhance the flexibility of product and labour markets have helped our economies to absorb shocks. But few people doubt that stability requires credible monetary institutions. The practice and theory of monetary policy has travelled a long way over the past 15 years or so. As performance has improved, so more refined questions have emerged about the optimal conduct and communication of policy. Many of those issues will feature in this conference. My purpose this morning has been to cast those questions in the context of the political economy conditions in which individual central banks are constituted and operate, using the UK’s MPC as an example. Central bank independence is a solution to a political economy problem – time inconsistency. Precisely how that problem is resolved may legitimately vary from country to country. In the UK, it was achieved only after democratically elected politicians had done some of the politically contentious heavy lifting in bringing inflation down, and after a period in which the case for price stability had been made. The monetary regime introduced in 1997 was necessary to embed credibility. Its detailed design properly reflected UK circumstances. Circumstances elsewhere differ, and so details in central banking practices vary. But not every central bank practice everywhere may be optimal, and what is feasible for each country’s monetary system alters over time. We therefore need to learn from each other, without imagining that all design features travel safely: learning without proselytising. Academic research plays a huge role in keeping us intellectually honest, and so in progressing those debates.                                                       34  See Tucker, P. M.

Zeti Akhtar Aziz: Enhancing financial integration in the new Nusantara Luncheon address by Dr Zeti Akhtar Aziz, Governor of the Central Bank of Malaysia, at the Malaysia-Indonesia Investment & Finance Summit, Jakarta, 18 June 2007. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen:  There has been a long history that transcends several centuries in which international trade flourished in the Malay archipelago . The South East Asia region contained the important maritime routes for the trade between the East and West. This had brought with it, robust economic growth and regional prosperity.  Today, the South East Asian region – the Nusantara region continues to be one of the world's most dynamic regions. Since the turn of this century, our economies have re-emerged to be amongst the fastest growing in the global economy, amidst new challenges and fundamental economic and financial developments. Our steadfast reform and restructuring efforts have rewarded us with strengthened macroeconomic fundamentals and sound and stable financial systems. These efforts continue to be augmented by the strong the foundations that the region possesses, namely abundant natural and human resources, high savings rates and the ingrained aptitude to persevere and rise to the challenge.  The ASEAN 5 group of economies that includes Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Singapore have now for an extended period of time been on a steady growth path.  A more recent phenomenon in this decade, has been the increased economic and financial linkages within the region spurring further regional economic and regional financial integration. The geographical proximity and cultural similarities have been reinforced by the diverse strengths that exists in the region. These factors have been important in enhancing the integration process.  As this greater regional economic and financial integration is advanced, it will serve as a powerful catalyst for the future expansion of intra-regional trade and investment, creating a self-sustaining and mutually reinforcing economic growth in the New Nusantara region.  Ladies and gentlemen:  It is my pleasure today to speak on the potential role of an integrated economic and financial platform within the Nusantara region, a region of rapid economic growth in which almost 300 million Muslims resides. My remarks will focus on the potential generated by a collaborative platform and the significance of building linkages between the Nusantara region with other parts of the world.  The region's current economic progress, prosperity and financial stability has now accorded us a new strategic window of opportunity to develop new value propositions to unleash the full potential accorded by the accelerating economic and financial integration process. There are already encouraging formal and informal inter linkages between our respective financial markets as well as a higher level of engagement between the respective corporate communities, the market participants and the authorities.  A collaborative platform that is based on the diverse comparative advantages of the Nusantara economies can benefit from the complementarities between our respective economies. Essentially, these opportunities will increase the potential to expand markets, increase products lines and deepen the research and development capabilities. In this regard, the emergence of Islamic finance into the mainstream of the financial system is an opportunity for the Nusantara financial intermediaries, in particular, for Malaysia and Indonesia and other neighbouring countries, to open new frontiers and in so doing strengthen further the economic and financial linkages.  The building of a Nusantara financial platform would not only facilitate and mobilise the pool of investable funds from the respective economies but also allow for the more efficient allocation of the funds into the productive investments in other parts of the region. This would not only contribute towards lowering the cost of funds but it would also allow for greater diversifications of risks.  More recently there has been growing interest in cross border participation in investment activities in our respective economies. Malaysia's capital inflows into Indonesia has increased by three-fold totalling USD2.2 billion in 2006 compared to the previous year. It is estimated that Indonesia requires BIS Review 73/2007 1 
approximately an annual investment of USD22 billion for the next several years for the development of its infrastructure, with a large part of the funding to be provided by the private sector. In the same way, the Ninth Malaysia Plan for the period of 2006 to 2010 has a financing requirement of RM107.6 billion. The development of our regional financial intermediaries and markets will facilitate the mobilisation of resources towards financing these potential activities and thus contribute to sustaining development in the Nusantara economies.  Ladies and Gentlemen:  The profound changes in the global economic and financial environment, has created a greater urgency for the Southeast Asian markets to achieve a greater degree of financial integration. This is so as to provide the scale and increased efficiency of the financial intermediation process. As the ASEAN economies move towards the formation of an economic-bloc by 2015, the pace of financial integration will need to accelerate, to better facilitate achieving this goal. The wide spread distribution of innovative hybrid financial products and regional cross selling activities will however increase the multi-dimensional dynamics of the markets and the risks across national borders. There will be increased complexity in identifying the risks which will in turn complicate the process of risk management. The increasingly integrated and liberalised markets will also expose our porous economies to greater external influences and to contagion risks. A higher level of vigilance is thus required to allow for pre-emptive policy measures in a timely manner. This will require adequate levels of cooperation among the regional regulators in addressing potentially contagion systemic risks and ensuring regional financial stability.  The deepening of co-operation between the Nusantara's monetary and regulatory authorities is thus a key factor in the development of a robust integrated platform. Enhanced cooperation will promote greater resilience and reduce regional vulnerability to external developments. There are now various regional mechanisms in place to undertake regional surveillance, to facilitate the exchange of information, to enter into greater engagement on issues affecting the region and in developing regional financial markets. In addition, frameworks for enhanced regional risk management, crisis management and resolution are also being put in place.  With greater financial integration, the region will be able to leverage on the advantages of economies of scale, innovation and more importantly place greater reliance on the cumulative strengths that resides within the region including our financial resources, skills and knowledge. It will also better position the region to collectively address emerging issues and challenges faced by the region taking into consideration the region's socio-economic context.  Ladies and Gentlemen:  While Islamic finance is gaining global interest and acceptance, the world's most populated Muslim region in the world, the New Nusantara offers opportunities for the accelerated expansion of Islamic finance. The intrinsic nature of Islamic financial structures encourages stability. Islamic principles require that the financial transaction be supported by genuine economic transactions. To further reinforce this, the governing Shariah principles also serve as a built-in self-regulatory mechanism that insulate Islamic instrument issuers from unproductive, speculative and unethical elements and thereby contributes to the stability of the financial system.  Historically, capital financing and investment flows into the Nusantara region have generally been sourced from the developed financial markets. While we may see continued growth in short term capital inflows from these traditional sources, the more competitive global environment provides no assurance of the sustainability of such longer term investment flows. Meanwhile, our own South East Asian region and that of North Asia and the Middle East countries continue to have high surplus savings seeking opportunities for investment and new asset-classes for greater risk diversification and improved returns on their investments.  Hundreds of years ago, the ports of Nusantara were destinations for the spice trade to Europe via India and the Middle East . In this context, Islamic finance can serve as a bridge that links the Nusantara region to the capital surplus economies. Already, our financial institutions are venturing to have a presence in the Middle East and we welcome their presence in our financial system. This has now in fact resulted in the cross-pollination of talents and resources, giving rise to innovative products and services, creating depth and breadth to the respective financial markets.  Just as the Straits of Malacca served as an important maritime conduit for the Nusantara region, Malaysia and Indonesia has the potential to serve as an important intermediary for mobilising capital to meet the requirements of the Nusantara region, and to be a distribution centre for shariah compliant 2 BIS Review 73/2007 
securities and to extend the regional Islamic capital markets to other parts of the world. Of importance will be our joint efforts to promote the standardisation of the Islamic regulatory and compliance matters. In relation to this, Malaysia and Indonesia is already working jointly to promote research capabilities and the pool of talent and technical expertise in Islamic finance.  A critical success factor for the cross-border promotion of Islamic finance is the harmonisation of the governing shariah frameworks between our jurisdictions. In this regard, Indonesia's extensive history of scholarly achievement in the subject matter relevant to the principles of Islamic finance can be leveraged upon for the benefit of the region. We are most hopeful for substantive convergence of interpretation and application of the shariah laws and guidelines for the region. The greater collaborative engagement between our respective scholars would indeed facilitate the process.  Ladies and Gentlemen:  The large gathering of senior representatives of the public and private sectors here today hints to the significant interest to capitalise on potential of the Nusantara economies. The efforts of the private and public sectors in building a collaborative platform as a resilient base for a network of linkages to the wider world, with God's grace, insyallah, will contribute to advancing the Nusantara Agenda that would unleash the potential of the region for a greater shared prosperity. Thank you.  BIS Review 73/2007 3 
John Gieve: London, money & the UK economy Speech by Sir John Gieve, Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, at The University of Surrey, Guildford, 26 June 2007. *      *      * Introduction The past year has been one of rapid growth and record profits for much of the financial sector worldwide. The strength of the world economy has provided a favourable wind but the spectacular growth of derivative markets and the spate of leveraged buy outs have also fuelled the growth. And, of course, London has been at the centre of the story. In a speech in March I discussed the renewed ascent of London as a centre of international finance and concluded that it was based on powerful economic forces which were likely to persist.1 I showed how the leading position London built up in the days when Britannia ruled the waves gave it a strong comparative advantage based on language, law, time zone and, above all, by a concentration of expert labour. This allowed London to maintain an important role in international finance even while Britain’s overall economic and political position was eroded. In the last twenty years we have seen a resurgence in the City which has established a strong position not just in traditional markets like foreign exchange, where its share is around 30% of trading, but in new products, with a share in OTC derivatives markets over 40%.2 The rapid growth of hedge funds in the West End is the latest example of the innovation that this cluster of financial skills has produced. You know something must be happening when the Mayor of New York commissions a review of the threat London poses to New York’s position. London’s recent growth certainly has a cyclical element but it also reflects two more structural changes – the removal of barriers to international capital movements and the advances in information technology. These have led to a growing role for international capital markets compared to national banking and to a growing concentration of those markets in a few hubs among which London and New York are dominant. And this finance revolution is still underway. It is far more advanced in the US than in Europe and in Europe than in Asia. In the absence of disasters therefore London, as the pre-eminent centre outside the US, can look forward to a long period of fast growth and expect its share of the UK economy to increase. This evening I want to discuss the implications of that trend for the UK economy and for economic policy. On the first, is London a goose laying golden eggs for the rest of the country or is it more of a cuckoo in the nest? On the second, how does the growth of London and financial markets generally impact on the Bank’s core functions of setting monetary policy and maintaining financial stability. Finally I discuss the impact of financial developments on the growth of money and credit and the significance of that for the broader economy. London’s impact on the wider economy In principle, when one sector of an economy enjoys rapid growth, we would expect to see three broad developments: • rewards earned by factors which are specific to the booming industry rise; • unless there are sufficient unemployed resources available, productive resources shift into the booming industry; and • employment in other tradable goods industries falls.                                                       1  Gieve, J “The City’s Growth: The Crest of a Wave or Swimming with the Stream”, to the London Society of Accountants, 26 March 2007. 2  I use “the City” here loosely to cover not just the Square Mile but the whole of London’s wholesale financial sector including in Canary wharf and the West End. A fuller exposition would also give more attention to successful regional centres including Edinburgh. BIS Review 73/2007 1 
The results were illustrated by the Dutch experience with gas in the 1960s and by the UK experience with North Sea oil in the early 1980s.3 In both cases, part of the mechanism was a rise in the real exchange rate and consequent pressure on other sectors. Is that happening now in the UK? It is much harder to identify the impact of the City than the impact of the discovery of gold or oil. London’s position has developed gradually and the statistics rarely separate the group of wholesale financial markets and supporting legal, accounting and other services that make London special from a broader group including retail banking and insurance and business services. But there is some evidence that all three factors are at work. The story seems clearest with the specific factors of production. The cost of commercial property in London, for example, has grown rapidly. According to Jones Lang Lasalle Research, in the City average capital values are over $25,000 per sq.m, above both Paris and New York. And the costs in the West End, the main home of the new hedge fund industry, are almost twice as high. There is no doubt that the success of London’s financial centre is helping to fuel demand for office space from Canary Wharf to Mayfair. And of course it is not just commercial property in London that has been booming. House price inflation in London has outstripped the rest of the UK (Chart 1), and in Kensington and Chelsea average house prices have risen by almost 40% since the start of 2005, compared with 20% for Greater London as a whole. ECA International published a survey comparing average monthly rents for a 70-square metre unfurnished flat in the largest cities and showed London over € 2,100, compared with New York around € 1,750 and Paris below € 1,500. The figures on output also show that London has been growing relative to the rest of the country (Chart 2), and that has reflected the growth of financial and business services compared with other tradable sectors throughout the UK (Chart 3 and Chart 4). And despite the fall in oil production in the North Sea, we have seen a rise in the real exchange rate by over 15% when comparing the period 1987-1997 to 1997-2007, although of course the financial sector would not have been the only factor behind that rise. More immediately, the GDP figures in May showed that financial intermediation grew by 6% in the sixth months to 2007 Q1 – an annual rate of over 13%. That is not the same as the City of course; but there is every reason to think the City has been growing at least as fast as the rest. However, while the success of the City is currently one factor in these trends, it is not the whole story. For a start there is a lot more to London than finance. There are other successful industries and, on the other hand, London is home not just to the wealthiest boroughs but also to some of the poorest and most deprived areas in the country. As a result it has one of the highest regional rates of unemployment overall. Secondly employment and profits in the City have been highly cyclical. On scale first, a recent estimate put the total number employed in “City” jobs, including supporting professions like lawyers and accountants as well as bankers and asset managers, at around 340,000. That amounts to about 9% of the total in London; significant but still lower than the number in distribution or in government services. And the growth of employment will continue to be the net result from the expansion of activity and from the economies made possible by IT and by the relocation particularly of back office work to cheaper areas elsewhere in the UK or abroad. The jobs figures understate the importance of the sector in the economy because on average pay may be twice as high in the financial sector as in the rest of the economy; 9% of wages and salaries in the year to March compared to 4% of employment. And within London its share is even greater. The average earnings of someone working in London’s financial intermediation sector in 2006 were around £90,000. On that basis, the financial sector might account for around 20% of remuneration in London. However it is still far from the only game in town. For example the Work Foundation’s fascinating new report on the creative industries suggests that their growth has contributed at least as much as the City to London’s overall performance. Moreover, while the trend is upwards, there is a marked cycle in the financial sector. Over the last 10 years, for example there has been a striking swing in employment with rapid growth during the dotcom boom followed by a sharp fall and subsequent recovery (Chart 5).                                                       3  The UK is a net exporter of financial services, running a surplus in 2006 of £26 billion (or 2% of GDP) on financial services and insurance. North Sea oil production peaked in 1999, and in 2006 was nearly 40% below this peak. 2 BIS Review 73/2007 
That reflects a strong cycle in financial sector profits (Chart 6) which is an international phenomenon – indeed, in the last 10 years major European financial firms and US securities dealers saw an even bigger cycle in their profitability than major UK financial firms (Chart 7). The same is true for earnings (Chart 8). This reflects the importance of bonuses which account for around 20% of remuneration in the financial sector compared with around 5% across the economy as a whole. The figures in the City itself can be considerably higher. A figure of 50% is common in investment banking, in which a rough rule of thumb is that firms distribute about half their pre bonus profits to staff. It is estimated that 4200 workers in the City received bonuses worth more than £1million in 2006/07. Of course the growth in those bonuses is contributing to the widening inequality of incomes at the top of the earnings distribution. Chart 9 compares the 90th, 95th, and 99th percentile with the median and shows that the main change is at the top. If we break that top percentile down further, we see a more dramatic widening. This is not just true of the City or of the UK. The average CEO in the UK earns around 100 times more than the average worker but there is an even wider gap in the US, with the average pay of CEOs over 250 times that of the average worker in 2005, having risen from around 100 times in 1995. In 1999 Eddie George likened the change in the City since Big Bang to Wimbledon.4 The UK still prospered by providing the venue even though most of the players were foreign. Today I think the Premiership may provide an even better analogy. That is partly because foreigners now own an increasing number of the venues as well as supplying many of the players. That is a striking illustration of Britain’s openness to foreign ownership which sets it some way apart from most other countries both in Europe and America. But it is also because both the City and the Premiership have become the centres of global industries with a dramatic impact on revenues and on earnings. One of my first footballing heroes was Johnny Haynes, the David Beckham of his day as a passer of a football. In the 1960s he became the first player to earn £100 per week (roughly £1500 in today’s terms) in the British game which was then about four times the average male wage. Top Premiership players now earn more than 200 times the average wage. What has changed is the fact that pay is now being set in a world market. We have in the Premiership as in the City some of the best paid people in an international industry which is developing rapidly. We have imported the top of the world earnings scale and at a time when the stretch at the top world wide is increasing very fast. Just as in the Premiership, the stars of the City – the people who have not just the talent but the recent experience and networks to perform at the top level today – can command a high proportion of the returns from being at the hub of the industry. The growth of hedge funds and private equity can be seen in part as a move by the small group who have sufficient expertise in new instruments and markets to take more of the returns on ownership.5To sum up so far, internationalisation and technology favour the clustering of financial markets in London so we should expect London to continue to prosper relative to the financial industry worldwide and to the rest of the UK economy. That will tend to reinforce the trends of recent years with: • a continuing shift of resources into the financial markets and into London itself, • a continuing pressure for higher rents and rewards for those with the right combination of talent and experience, but also • a strong cycle in profits, pay and employment.                                                       4  E George, "Before the Millennium: From the City of London", 7 December 1999. 5  Even for a footballer, being at your peak at the right time and place is critical to earnings. But with football like athletics, it is obvious that the best have outstanding talent. It is harder to believe the all the high earners in the City are intrinsically more intelligent or determined than others whether in universities, hospitals or factories. But the demand for the best paid reflects not just talent but experience. There may be many people who could run a trading floor given the right training but there are inevitably only a few who can demonstrate current success in doing so. Experience, like status and talent, is a “positional good”. BIS Review 73/2007 3 
Implications for economic policy That leads straight on to the first implication for policy makers. As London strengthens its position in financial markets, the cycle in international finance will have direct effects not just through the shifts in interest rates and asset prices but through jobs and pay in an important sector of the London economy. Any international financial crisis will be important not just because of its knock on effects on the core banks and markets on which British industry and households depend but because of its direct impact on the real economy. The growth of the City also affects the interpretation of some of the core statistics we use to monitor and assess how the economy is developing, including those on output, earnings and, above all, money and credit. First our GDP numbers don’t pick up financial sector very fully. In most sectors the contribution to GDP is roughly the sum of pay and profits. Measuring the output of the financial sector is more difficult. In the financial sector some types of banking activity are excluded from the final GDP figures. In 2008 the ONS plan to expand the GDP figures to include what is called FISIM and reflects those activities of banks which they cover by their net interest income.6 That will improve estimates of GDP, but they will continue to exclude income that banks earn through proprietary dealing. This is probably be right as a matter of national accounting principle but dealing in securities is a part of what some international banks do. As a result changes in the level of activity in the City may not be fully captured in the GDP figures which most economic models, including the Bank’s, use as their summary statistic for the real economy. Second the growing importance of bonuses in the financial sector can make it harder to interpret statistics on earnings. City bonuses are generally paid at the start of the year. As Chart 10 shows this leads to big peaks and troughs. At times when changes in earnings growth are of great interest, as they have been in recent months, it is difficult to identify the underlying path. The difficulty is partly a technical issue of how to smooth out the monthly variations. Do we spread the bonuses backwards over the last 12 months on the grounds that they are deferred pay conditional on profits in that period (with the consequence that you don’t know the true earnings figure for any month until over a year later)? Do you spread them forward because they will tend to be spent over the coming year? Or do you do a bit of both? To that uncertainty we can add the fact that there several different measures of earnings growth including two – the AWE and AEI – which are telling a somewhat different tale.7There is also a more conceptual challenge. Are bonuses to be treated as part of the cost of labour or are they a form of profit sharing? The economic implications may be quite different. In practice they are probably a bit of both; bonuses are much higher when profits are good, but they are unlikely to disappear entirely in tough times (witness the concept of the “guaranteed bonus”). But estimating how they divide up is not easy. Money and credit The third area in which the development of financial markets is complicating the interpretation of statistics is money and credit. And again that is an area of keen attention at the moment. The question is whether the recent growth of the money supply is telling us something about the prospects for inflation and the economy that we are not getting from other variables – like consumption, interest rates, prices, or inflation expectations. Chart 11 shows monetary growth over 130 years in the UK against consumer inflation. The association is obvious. But even in the days of the gold standard when the Bank had a more direct control of the money supply, money growth and inflation diverged for periods (eg in the late 19th century and in the late 1920s). More recently, the growth of money in the 1970s did act as a leading indication for inflation. But in the early 1980s the relationship appeared to break down despite,                                                       6 “Improving the measurement of banking services in the UK National Accounts", Leonidas Akriditis, ONS Economic and Labour Market Review, May 2007 7  I have used the AWE in this speech, even though it is the more recent and less well established of the two, because it is designed to handle outliers at the top and bottom of the ranges better and the City has a disproportionate number of outliers. 4 BIS Review 73/2007 
or possibly because of, the fact that the monetary authorities were explicitly targeting the monetary aggregates as a means of controlling inflation. Part of the explanation of the divergence was that the 1980s were a period of rapid financial innovation following the removal of exchange controls and of pricing, income and dividend policies. This changed the amount of money people were willing to hold for a given amount of money spending (which in economics is known as the velocity of circulation). So the increase in money growth did not lead to a pick up in inflation. Even so the acceleration of monetary growth at the end of the 1980s did foreshadow the upturn of inflation at the end of the Lawson boom. The chart shows that since 1992 the rates of growth in broad money and inflation have diverged again and that broad money growth has picked up sharply since 2003. A key question is whether this reflects a further spurt in financial innovation or is telling us that we should expect increasing growth of money spending and inflation. There are good grounds for attributing part of the increase to structural changes in the financial markets which have led “other financial companies” (OFCs) to hold more deposits with the banks for a given level of economic activity.8It is within this OFCs sector that the growth in money has been the most rapid (Chart 12). The view that much of this growth reflects structural changes of this sort is supported in my view by the way the spread between deposit and loan rates of interest has vanished in the last few years (Chart 13). Of course that might be the product of competition between banks to lend more and attract more deposits; it also seems plausible that much of this lending is more about balance sheet restructuring than making a profit. However deposits associated with special purpose vehicles and intra-group only account for part of the growth. Even if we strip out all OFC deposits the growth rate of money has still been strong compared with the growth rate of money spending (Chart 14). In my final section I want to discuss what we should make of this. The significance of the money supply In the Treasury in the 1980s I was a close observer of the attempts to find a monetary aggregate as an intermediate target to guide policy. We were looking for both a predictable relationship between the policy instrument, interest rates, and the measure of money and a predictable relationship between that and our final objective, inflation. I remember the frustrations when both links proved unreliable. I am in no doubt that we are better off focussing directly on our final target, inflation. However I was struck, returning eighteen months ago to the economic debate, how the place of money in our debates had changed. Our model, like most others, is “new Keynesian”. As a result, the discussion sometimes seems to resemble the discussions of “demand management” in the 1970s more than the monetarist debates of the 1980s. But, if anyone was in any doubt, monetarism was not dead but only resting. And it has recently taken wing again as persistent monetary growth and rising asset prices have given us food for thought. At times the discussion of money can seem detached from the rest of the policy debate. Having listed all the other aspects of the economy factors – like world growth, consumption, financial markets and the labour market – “money” emerges as though it was a separate determinant impacting directly on inflation or inflation expectations like Heineken “refreshing the parts other beers cannot reach”.9 But money is very much part of the real world and we don’t need any hidden or ghostly mechanisms to see how it feeds through credit, asset prices and consumption in the wider economy.                                                       8  The clearest example is the service offered by London Clearing House, where dealers effectively transact with each other (via gilt repo transactions) across the balance sheet of LCH, which results in an increase in both OFC’s deposits with and borrowing from banks. Similarly, in the case of a synthetic securitisation of corporate bonds, a special purpose vehicle (SPV) is set up to issue securities to investors and holds a cash deposit at a bank from which it makes payments if any of the securitised loans default. Both of these examples result in an increased in measured deposits at banks, but neither presages more nominal spending. 9  G Ryle “The Concept of Mind” London (1949) Hutchinson.

We need to start as the Governor has said by trying to distinguish supply shocks from demand shocks.10 Where growth in money is driven by the wish of consumers or companies to increase their holdings of money for a given level of spending, there need be no effect on nominal GDP or inflation. As I have discussed there is clear evidence of changes in demand of that sort in the financial sector. But that is not the whole story. So have there been increases in supply of money and if so how will they feed through into the economy? What does a supply shock look like? It is easiest to visualise in a closed economy in which the money supply is mainly notes issued by the monetary authorities. One can imagine then a direct increase in supply – a helicopter drop of extra notes. In that world people would really find themselves with extra cash in their pockets and would be expected to go out and spend some or all of it. With more money chasing the same goods, we would see a direct impact, first on money spending, then on inflation. In the modern world the nearest equivalent to helicopter drops has been the monetary financing of government deficits. But monetary financing is not a problem we face at the moment, indeed it is not allowed within the EU under the Maastricht Treaty. So what we need to be concerned about today is the creation of extra money through the banking system and the way that happens is through the granting of credit to willing borrowers who borrow to spend on assets, investment or consumption. The supply changes we need to spot are changes in banks’ willingness to lend. And we don’t have to look far to find some. Take, for example, the growth of consumer credit in the UK (Chart 15). We see rapid growth in the late 90s and early years of this century followed by a sharp decline as banks began to see defaults rising. Another recent example is the sub prime market in the US. Chart 16 shows the arrears rates on successive cohorts of loans, marking very clearly the reduction in credit quality in 2006 as the market overshot. In both cases the figures and the market explanations confirm that these movements reflect at least in part changes in the supply curve for credit. The borrowers were willing but the banks were also pushing the supply by reducing costs and conditions (culminating some said in NINJA mortgages – for those with no income, no job and no assets). So I have no doubt that we have seen some supply changes to credit. Next we need to distinguish the sustainable changes from the cyclical. Sustained changes either in the economy or in financial sector technology may justify some increase in supply. For example, we have seen a long period of low and stable inflation and unemployment and that is expected to continue. That reduces some of the risks to lenders and borrowers and may increase both the demand and supply of credit and the value of assets on a lasting basis. The development of information technology allows banks to collect and analyse more information about borrowers which should allow them to target credit better and justify a change in supply. Finally the development of derivative markets has allowed the risks in loans to be split into their separate components and distributed to the people best placed to bear them. Again that should lower the supply curve for credit. All these factors were at play in the consumer credit and the sub prime markets but, despite the new sophistication of credit scoring and the derivatives markets, they both also showed all the classic signs of a credit cycle. Banks competed for business by lowering the costs and conditions on lending while the economy expanded, defaults were few, and profits appeared high. They overdid it, defaults started to rise, losses were taken and they toughened their terms again. The speed and severity of that cycle can have implications for financial stability as well as the stability of the broader economy. It is for that reason that there is a wide acceptance that there may be a case for monetary policy to “lean into the wind” in a cyclical upswing.11 That has been one factor in my support for the four interest rate rises of the last year. If there is evidence of a cyclical, unsustainable, element in the supply of credit and asset prices the next questions are: • where are we in the cycle, and                                                       10  M King “Speech to CBI Dinner, Wales”, 11 June 2007. 11  C Bean “Inflation Targeting: The UK Experience”, speech at the Annual Conference of the German Economic Association, 1 October 2003. 6 BIS Review 73/2007 
• is the present stance of monetary policy sufficient to bring it back to a sustainable trend or, given the lags in the impact of interest rate changes, is it set to exacerbate the downturn? Current conjuncture So where are we now? The consumer credit market in the UK and the sub prime and broader housing markets in the US have turned down and, while the sub prime saga is still not played out, it still seems unlikely that it will have severe knock on effects on the broader economy. Elsewhere the commercial property in the UK looks to be at or close to its peak (Chart 17).The housing market is showing some glimmers of a slowdown in activity but prices are still rising fast, especially in London; indeed the rate of increase of house prices is higher today in nearly every region than it was last autumn. And there is no sign of a slowdown in corporate lending. Overall lending to PNFCs is accelerating (Chart 18), investment is high, and on a global basis we are seeing spectacular growth in the LBO market (Chart 19) and the emergence of lower prices and conditions with so called “covenant lite” loans. Against that background the question is whether we have done enough. In reaching a judgement, of course, we need to take account of the full range of information on the real and nominal economy. We know that the full impact of past increases in rates has yet to come through. Yet we cannot be sure how much of a restraint current rates will be at this point in the cycle. It is not surprising therefore that there are different views on the MPC or that those views change in response to more information. My stance in recent months has reflected a judgement on the balance of risks taking account of both probabilities and likely impacts. The risks we face are: first that we may increase interest rates too fast or push them up too far, with an unnecessary loss of growth, and second that we may raise rates too slowly with a cost in higher inflation and potentially higher interest rates and a sharper slowdown in the end. I voted for a further increase earlier this month partly because I was not convinced that current rates would be sufficient to bring credit growth and nominal demand back to their long term sustainable path. I also felt that the impact of moving too slowly on the credibility of the regime and thus the future prospects for the economy was of greater concern, given the robust rate of growth, than an unnecessary slowdown in activity. In reviewing the position again in future months I will be watching the trends in the growth of credit and money carefully. BIS Review 73/2007 7

Tharman Shanmugaratnam: Corporate governance developments in Singapore and the region Speech by Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Deputy Chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, Minister for Education and Second Minister for Finance, at The OECD Asian Corporate Governance Roundtable, Singapore, 27 June 2007. *      *      * Introduction Good morning and a very warm welcome to Singapore. It gives me great pleasure to be here at the OECD Asian Corporate Governance Roundtable. The last time the Roundtable was held in Singapore was in 2001, and we are happy to be able to host this important international gathering once again. 10 years after the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, this year’s Roundtable gives us a good opportunity to do a stock-take, to see where we are now and identify the areas where we must continue to move forward in the region. Avoiding complacency in a benign economic environment The macro picture amongst the Asian countries is vastly improved. The Asian economies are by and large showing strong growth, driven in large part by increased trade and investments both within Asia as well as with the rest of the world. Investor confidence is back. Capital inflows are back to the levels that existed before the Asian crisis. And strong inflows of portfolio capital and foreign direct investments have replaced bank lending as a dominant source of capital inflows. Last year, the ASEAN-5 countries, for example, attracted some US$50 billion of foreign direct investment, significantly greater than the US$28 billion seen in 1997. Institutional investors are allocating more funds to Asia, in search of higher yields and to benefit from the strong growth in the region. Improvements in corporate governance are part of this story. But even in this positive climate, we must remain wary of risks. Terrorism and avian flu are not distant threats. The abundance of liquidity in global and Asian markets has also led to a narrowing of credit spreads that is unlikely to persist for long. The repricing of risk may be triggered by a variety of events, arising for example from a geopolitical disturbance, an unexpected setback in economic growth, or the failure of a major borrower in global financial markets. The repricing of risk, unwinding of spreads and contraction of liquidity in higher risk assets and markets may be sudden, and may not be orderly. On the positive side, the innovations we have seen in global financial markets, including the extensive securitization of assets and growth of the derivatives market, has parceled out risks more widely and perhaps more evenly in the system. But it also makes the system less predictable in the event that things go wrong. We cannot predict how contagion will spread in global markets. It is critical that the hard lessons on corporate governance learnt during the fall out from the Asian crisis are not lost during the current period of benign economic growth and relatively easy availability of funds. When the flight to safety and quality occurs, it will be those countries and companies with robust standards of corporate governance that will be better placed to keep the loyalties of investors. Corporate governance developments in the region We should therefore keep up the momentum of progress. Since the crisis, the Asian Roundtable countries have indeed made substantial progress in important areas of corporate governance reform. I will run through two key areas of progress very briefly. Growth and strengthening of standard-setting bodies Institutions matter. Several countries in Asia have established national committees on corporate governance since the crisis . The private sector has also strengthened its act. We have seen a number of institutes of directors set up in many countries, including China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, South Korea, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines. Minority shareholder watchdog groups are also now in place in countries such as Malaysia, South Korea and Taiwan. And Institutes of Directors, in particular, BIS Review 73/2007 1 
now play a key role in developing training programmes for both directors and management. In some countries – for example, Malaysia and Thailand, such training programmes have become a mandatory prerequisite for directors of listed companies. So we have seen a strengthening of both public and private bodies aimed at the common objective of scaling up standards of corporate governance. Corporate governance regulations and best practices We have seen considerable reform in the regulations and codes of corporate governance, as well as the actual practice of corporate governance in the Asian Roundtable economies. For instance, Pakistan, Chinese Taipei and Thailand all adopted new codes in 2002, while new or updated codes have been adopted in Bangladesh, Hong Kong, Indonesia and Korea since 2003. This has yielded visible benefits. There is greater clarity in many Asian economies regarding the fiduciary duties of the directors of listed companies. There has also been progress made in terms of more independent directors being introduced to the boards of listed companies in the Asian region . Accounting rules have also been beefed up across the region. Some of the Asian Roundtable countries have made significant moves towards convergence with international standards and best practices on accounting. China, India, Indonesia and Philippines, have for example revised their accounting standards to bring them more in line with international standards. Corporate governance in Singapore Corporate governance in Singapore has similarly undergone evolution. I shall leave it to the speakers from the Singapore Institute of Directors and the Singapore Exchange to share on these more fully. I will talk briefly instead about our overall approach to corporate governance. Regulatory framework – balance of mandatory rules and best practices First, let me touch on the regulatory framework for corporate governance. In recent years, we have moved away from a merit-based approach towards a disclosure-based approach. The objective is to equip market participants with better information, let them take responsibility for making their own decisions and to judge the quality of the corporate governance of companies. But a disclosure-based approach can only work well if it is backed up by a robust enforcement regime. This is key to maintaining the confidence of market participants in the disclosure-based regime. In recent years, our regulatory authorities have acted decisively in the face of breaches by market participants, such as in the cases of ACCS, Citiraya and China Aviation Oil. Equally important for a disclosure-based regime is the raising of the bar on corporate governance standards themselves. Singapore’s approach here is a flexible one, recognising the need to cater to a range of companies of different sizes and resources. It comprises a balance of mandatory rules, captured in our legislation and listing rules, and best practice recommendations in the form of the Code of Corporate Governance. Listed companies are required to either adopt the best practice recommendations or to disclose instances where they have not done so and provide explanations for these – in other words companies must “comply or explain”. We will keep both our legislation and best practice codes up to date through regular refinement, so that they stay relevant to a changing environment. We will also keep close watch on developments internationally, to see if they might be relevant to the Singapore environment. For example, the UK has enacted a new Companies Act 2006 in which the duties of directors have been codified. Recently, there have been discussions between the Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Singapore, or ICPAS, and the Singapore Institute of Directors, or SID, regarding directors’ responsibilities for the internal controls and accounting policies and estimates that are relevant to companies’ financial statements, and how these responsibilities of directors should be reflected in auditors’ reports. This recent issue illustrates the importance for clarity on directors’ duties amongst all stakeholders. The Accounting & Corporate Regulatory Authority, or ACRA, will lead a study on the duties of directors, taking into account of standards observed internationally as well as the corporate environment in Singapore. ACRA will work with the Singapore Institute of Directors, ICPAS, the MAS and SGX, and other stakeholders in this study. 2 BIS Review 73/2007 
Corporate governance – enhancing performance A sound and responsive regulatory framework is critical to corporate governance. But it is worth reminding ourselves that corporate governance is not merely about compliance with the rules. Corporate governance is in the wider sense about how the business and affairs of a company are directed and managed in order to enhance corporate performance and long-term shareholder value. Good corporate governance is ultimately about performance and accountability to shareholders. This relates to the effective functioning of the board – how it draws on different skill-sets amongst directors, how it sets strategies, and how it interacts with senior management to build knowledge and make decisions in the interests of shareholders. Well-functioning boards aimed at sustained performance are in truth work-in-progress in Singapore and elsewhere in Asia – we probably have more distance to cover in this regard than in compliance with rules. Many companies do not have a good mix of experience and skills amongst their directors. While some of the bigger companies may have the necessary resources and can seek outside help, there are a large number of companies that require help along this journey. We should therefore focus our energies not just on formulating sound rules and best practice codes, but on encouraging and helping companies to address practical issues in making their boards effective and high-performing. Corporate governance study commissioned by MAS and SGX This is one of the reasons why MAS and SGX jointly commissioned a study on improving the implementation of corporate governance practices in Singapore. This study was carried out by Associate Professor Mak Yuen Teen of the National University of Singapore’s Business School and the Corporate Governance and Financial Reporting Centre. The study focused on assessing the current state of corporate governance practices in Singapore and proposing practical measures to improve board effectiveness and governance. Details of the study can be found in the report, which MAS and SGX will be publishing on their websites later today. For now, let me highlight two particular areas of the study’s recommendations that we have started working on. Professional development and training of directors One area of improvement is in the training of directors. Having committed and skilled directors is a key component in the effective functioning of the board. Director training is particularly relevant for new or first-time directors, to assist them in understanding their roles and responsibilities, and to equip them with the necessary skills. Even experienced directors need to continually upgrade their skills, to oversee and steer companies in today’s rapidly changing and globalised landscape. MAS has been in discussion with the Singapore Institute of Directors on how we can build on its very useful work to date, and develop a comprehensive and sustained approach to training and development of directors in Singapore. MAS will help to fund a study that will help to operationalise this comprehensive approach to training. The study will cover a few areas. First, it will look into benchmarking directors’ training and development against best practices in other leading jurisdictions. A number of jurisdictions have in the last few years developed extensive structured training programs for directors. Secondly, it will examine possible collaborative arrangements between a range of organisations and training providers. Thirdly, it will also focus on how best such training initiatives should be financed. This is an important initiative to ensure our companies have skilled directors on their boards, who can help them to grow and expand in the region, and be recognized leaders in both performance and governance. Developing practical guides for listed companies and directors A second issue arising from the study has to do with developing practical guides for listed companies and directors. This is in line with helping companies help themselves on the path to better corporate governance, MAS will work with industry and professional bodies on practical guides on areas of interest to companies. BIS Review 73/2007 3 
The importance of an effective audit committee in particular was highlighted in the corporate governance study by Professor Mak. It noted that almost all corporate scandals involved some form of financial impropriety, with the audit committee often seen to be part of the governance failure. Some guidance on the roles, functions and skills required by an audit committee would be useful. We need to encourage well-qualified directors to take on the critical responsibility of being a member of an audit committee. Such practical guidance notes could be useful in helping directors on audit committees to understand their roles relative to that of senior management. It could also provide better focus on how they can add value by enabling the important interaction between strategy and financial and accounting controls. I note that the UK has issued similar guidance on Audit Committees – otherwise known as the Smith Guidance – to assist companies. Conclusion Let me conclude. The Asian Financial Crisis has served to highlight the importance of corporate governance. It is a key component that contributes to the strength of our markets and to the performance of our companies. While corporate governance practices across Asia have improved significantly, we cannot lower our guard. When times are good, we should press ahead and gain momentum in our efforts to improve corporate governance. But good corporate governance, as we all know, goes beyond box-ticking. It must be focused on both the spirit and substance behind corporate governance rules and guidelines. It is important that we convince companies of the inherent benefits of good corporate governance, as a tool for sustained corporate performance. Platforms like today’s OECD Asian Corporate Governance Roundtable are invaluable as we go forward. This is how we can share our experience, learn from each other, and perhaps do a bit of nudging. I wish you fruitful and insightful discussions. Thank you. 4 BIS Review 73/2007 
Nout Wellink: No globalisation without innovation Speech by Dr Nout Wellink, President of the Netherlands Bank and Chairman of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, at the 2007 Money and Banking Conference "Monetary Policy Under Uncertainty", hosted by the Central Bank of Argentina, Buenos Aires, 4 June 2007. *      *      * Introduction I grew up in a small Dutch village. Although it was not in a polder, to me the world seemed flat. It took several years before I saw mountains for the first time and realised that the world is not flat. The generation of my grandchildren misses this kind of experience. Flying long-distance at early age is no longer exceptional in the more prosperous parts of the world. The world has changed dramatically in the course of decades. Information technology has brought us many new opportunities, in particular mobility of people, goods and ideas. I’ll discuss technological progress, and what it means for the macro economy in general, and for monetary policy in particular. Globalisation is driven by technological change There are at least four manifestations of technological change that have dramatically reshaped the world over the past decades: • What we see in major cities are people from all over the world. What lies behind this is cheap and fast air traffic. Competition is a driving force. So is technology, which makes air transportation more efficient, and management skills that allow for splitting up the market in high yielding business-class tickets and low cost fares.  • What we see are cheap imports from China everywhere in the Western world. What lies behind this are low transportation costs thanks to the cargo container. The cargo container can move non-fragile goods for about 1% of retail value to anywhere in the world. In the pre-container era, shipping costs used to be between 10 and 20% of retail value.1 Apart from low transportation costs, additional factors are needed to explain the surge in Asian products in Western markets. In particular the catch-up of Asian economies is creating new trading opportunities.  • What we see is offshoring of labour-intensive production to low-wage countries. What lies behind this is that new technologies allow the production process to be unbundled. Production sites are located far from target markets, both in manufacturing and in the service industry. The share of offshored inputs in GDP can reach up to12%, as in Canada and the Netherlands.2   • What we see is low-skilled labour in the West feeling a cold wind of competition from cheap labour from Asia and Central and Eastern Europe . At the same time, wages for high-skilled labour are on the increase. What lies behind this is skill-biased technology. Automation lowers demand for low-skilled workers, since computers offer a substitute. But computers can also amplify natural advantages of high-skilled labour, as complements to labour. A talented professional can serve a much larger customer base due to new ICT opportunities. Financial engineering and management skills also tend to favour high-skilled labour.  These are just examples, illustrating that there would be no global economy without new technology. Technology has always been the driving force for change. This was the case when the invention of the printing press in the 15th century boosted the diffusion of ideas; and it is still the case in today’s world, where ideas are spreading much faster than twenty years ago thanks to the internet.                                                       1  J. Bradford DeLong (2006) The box that changed the world, Project Syndicate. 2  IMF (Spring 2007) World Economic Outlook. BIS Review 72/2007 1 
Macro-economic consequences Technological change has brought the world prosperity. In recent years, output growth has been at levels not seen since the early 70s. Not just Western economies are growing fast. China and India are integrating in the world economy at full speed. China’s average productivity growth over the last ten years was close to 10%. Average productivity growth in emerging and developing countries has also increased, to 5% last year.3 Despite a recent pick-up, productivity growth in Latin America is lagging that in other emerging markets. Although technology is a source of welfare, it can also have negative side-effects. For instance, the unprecedented speed at which ideas are passed between people is a key achievement of the ICT revolution. But it also allows bad ideas to travel fast, such as religious fundamentalism. I feel some sympathy for those who fear rapid technological change. But whether we like it or not, we can’t stop technological progress. Like toothpaste, once it’s out of the tube, it is hard to get it back in again. The challenge is to make sure that new technologies bring change for the better. There are winners and losers from technological change, at least in relative terms. The developing world at large is benefiting from recent developments. However, some areas are losing out. On the losing end are areas that lack connections to the container-handling network and the internet. This applies to areas that lack crucial infrastructure, be it reliable electricity and roads, or the rule of law. In the Western world, job security has diminished, not just for blue-collar workers. These days, services in ICT and other high-tech sectors are offshored to low-income countries. But the number of offshored jobs is still very modest compared to the total number of jobs lost and created. In the Netherlands, roughly 9.000 jobs are offshored each year, whereas the annual number of job destruction and creation is above 800.000.4 Since the ICT revolution is skill-biased, it favours high-over low-skilled labour. Fortunately, higher income inequality between high- and low-skilled workers does not necessarily imply that low-skilled workers are worse off. The IMF has shown that recent trends have increased the size of the pie. Cheaper inputs have lifted output and overall labour compensation by about 6% in real terms in advanced economies over the last 25 years.5 And all consumers benefit from lower prices. To keep labour market effects in check, employability is a key policy issue. Flexible employees can adapt to new circumstances that technology brings about. Governments can offer a helping hand by improving education, and by providing a social security system that encourages people to move from one job to another. In some countries, social security schemes may be so generous that they deter efforts to seek new employment. But the slogan “the lower, the better” goes much too far. In Latin America, for instance, social security schemes alleviate income inequality. If the benefits of economic growth are widely shared, support for economic reform can be expected to be broader than otherwise. Monetary policy The challenge for monetary policy is to adapt to the new environment. Fortunately, central banks have much more room for manoeuvre now than they had when Arthur Burns was appointed as Fed Chairman by President Richard Nixon back in 1970 with the words: [quote] “I respect his independence; however, I hope that independently he will conclude that my views are the ones that should be followed” [unquote]. Also downward pressure on inflation by cheap imports from low-income countries has made central bankers’ life in the Western world a bit easier than in the past. Prices for clothes and big ticket items such as cars and personal computers have declined. Computers became a lot cheaper if one takes into account quality improvements. The overall downward pressure on inflation has allowed for lower monetary policy interest rates, at least in the short term. In the longer term, the real equilibrium interest rate might rise. This would be the case if the world would have moved to a permanently higher trend rate of productivity growth. The jury is still out on                                                       3  Productivity is measured as real GDP divided by working age population.

whether this is true. Other things equal, a higher real equilibrium interest rate implies that monetary policy interest rates also have to move to a higher level, consistent with the new equilibrium. So, a major issue is to determine the trend rate of productivity growth. From a monetary policy point of view the question can be rephrased as: What is the level of growth at which the economy can operate without generating higher inflation? It is always difficult to determine the speed limits of an economy, but in times of change this is even more challenging. One development makes it particularly hard. That is the move from an industrial to a post-industrial society. In the 1950s, 30% of the US labour force was employed in manufacturing. Now the number is 10%. We have moved to a service oriented society. In the service industry, capacity utilisation cannot be measured by counting idle capacity in factories. Besides, productivity growth can only be estimated in an imprecise way. Usually, total factor productivity is used as the key measure. It is determined as a residual: productivity growth is the increase in value added that cannot be explained by the volume of inputs used. This measure is very rough. All in all, potential output and its growth rate is more difficult to determine than it was in an industrial economy. Uncertainty about potential output translates into uncertainty about the output gap between potential and actual output. It has always been tricky to base monetary policy on output gaps. Research by Orphanides suggests that the Great Inflation was to a large extent due to mismeasurement of potential output and the output gap.6 It appears virtually impossible to determine output gaps in real time. They can only be measured in a reliable way ex post, with the benefit of hindsight. “Life can only be understood backwards, but it must be lived forewards” as the Danish philosopher Kierkegaard said. This is certainly true for monetary policy, with its medium term objectives. How to cope with this? I’ve learnt a couple of things since I thought the world was flat. One is that the objectives of monetary policy should be modest. Fine-tuning economic growth has always been a too ambitious goal in a world with long and variable lags in monetary transmission. A clear focus on low and stable inflation can safeguard central banks against the temptation of activism. Given current uncertainties, monetary authorities must be particularly cautious in interpreting the output gap. They have to remain firm in reaction to actual inflation and other relatively reliable indicators of inflation risks, such as excessive wage growth. As a side remark, I add that, in theory, capital account liberalisation and trade openness warrant a sharper focus of monetary policy on price stability rather than output stabilisation.7 International capital mobility, as well as broader access to financial markets, creates new opportunities for households to smooth consumption over the years. Free international trade allows for specialisation in domestic production. As a result, it might be possible to disentangle consumption and production to a higher extent than in the past. In other words, households can cushion changes in production without intervention by the central bank. I would like to conclude with a warning. A focus on price stability is more complicated than it sounds. Low and stable consumer price inflation is no reason for complacency. In spite of consumer price stability, asset price inflation may signal underlying imbalances, such as an overoptimistic risk assessment by financial market participants that keeps long-term interest rates at unwarranted low levels. Monetary policymakers must be forward-looking, and assess possible divergences between real and nominal factors in the area of monetary aggregates, credit and asset markets. How this should be done in practice is a difficult question that deserves further elaboration. I won’t answer it now. Time is running out. Sometimes it is better to stop before one has finished.                                                       6  Athanasios Orphanides (2003) The quest for prosperity without inflation, Journal of Monetary Economics, Vol. 50, nr. 3. 7  Assaf Razin and Prakash Loungani (2006) Globalization and equilibrium inflation-output tradeoffs, NBER Working Paper nr. 11641.

Martín Redrado: Financial intermediation through institutions or markets? Opening address by Mr Martín Redrado, Governor of the Central Bank of Argentina, at Session I on Financial Intermediaton through Institutions or Markets? of the Sixth Annual Conference 2007 “Financial System and Macroeconomic Resilience”, Brunnen, 18 June 2007. *      *      * 1.  Introduction The significance of the financial system development for long-term economic growth has been deeply emphasized by the literature over the past fifteen years. This has found strong theoretical and empirical evidence, based on the ability of financial intermediaries to: (i) select the most productive projects, (ii) monitor and control the debtors during the project lifespan, (iii) diversify the risks and (iv) minimize the costs of mobilizing savings. Bank credit and to a lesser extent corporate bonds exceed equity financing all over the world. However, during the past 35 years banks have lost share in capturing family financial wealth in favor of equity and bond markets. The trend is stronger in industrial countries, but is also seen in many emerging markets. Regardless, firms still finance most of their investments with retained earnings (a recent paper from the Central Bank of Argentina shows that self-financing is still the preferred approach by firms worldwide). This fact – also known as pecking order where firms choose own funds first, then debt, and equity last of all – reflects the existence of asymmetric information problems and intermediation costs, which make own funds more economical than third-party funds. This paper aims at analyzing how financial innovation brings for complementarities between institutions and markets and its implications for monetary policy. Rather than the advantages associated to each type of channel, it is stressed that the total financial depth is what really matters, especially for emerging markets. Recent financial development and its relationship with macroeconomic stability is also briefly explored. 2.  Banks or capital markets? Financial instruments, markets and institutions appear with the purpose of mitigating informational asymmetries and transaction costs, including the costs of acquiring information, enforcing contracts and exchanging goods and financial claims. In so doing, the financial infrastructure contributes in the diversification of risk, capital allocation, monitoring of borrowers, and a smooth running of the payments system. Recent studies highlight the skills that markets have to broaden access to finance by, providing funding for economic agents beyond the banking system, and to mobilize large scale capital flows, to become a significant factor in economic growth. In this manner, in recent years the dominant position in the above debate shifted from “pro-bank” to “promarket”. This vision gained even more strength due to the setbacks suffered by Japanese banks during the nineties and to the spectacular performance of the world capital markets as from the second half of that decade. While banks extract information about firms more efficiently, when a firm joins the public debt market it reduces the information asymmetries permanently, diminishing the intervention costs and sidestepping the comparative advantages of the banks regarding the extraction of information. That is why once they are part of the capital market corporations tend to remain there rather than resorting to the banking system. The supporters of the market-based financial systems also assert that the markets reduce the inherent inefficiencies associated with banks, to promote a higher economic growth. Their position is based on the fact that large banks might block innovation by taking advantage of the information to which they have access and protect the incumbent firms with which they have a close relationship from possible competition. Large banks with few regulatory restrictions on their activities might also collude with firms against other creditors and block efficient corporate governance. From what we have seen so far, the literature could not resolve which of the two systems is better prepared to stimulate long term growth. In order to settle the debate, Ross Levine gathers information BIS Review 72/2007 1 
from 48 countries over the 1980-1995 period and carries out several regressions in order to explain the average per capita growth rate in terms of different measurements of the relative importance of markets compared to banks, and controlling for the usual variables in this kind of tests. As a measurement of the relative importance of the markets, he uses variables like the ratio of market capitalization to private sector credit and the ratio of trading turnover to loans. In all cases the results were not significant, indicating that the financial system structure seem to be irrelevant towards growth. Actually, the addition of market capitalization to bank loans is positive and highly significant. Levine’s conclusion, what he calls the “financial services view”, is that what matters is the total financial depth, irrespective of the division between banks and markets, which seems to provide settlement to the discussion. 3.  Towards complete financial markets: the importance of complementarities  Then the arguments in favor and against each system ultimately aim at their contribution to economic growth. In this sense, the empirical evidence reveals that both the capital markets and the banking system promote long term economic growth, because both have a positive impact on the growth rate of the economy, capital accumulation and productivity improvements. From the empirical evidence it is evident that banks supply services that differ from those the capital markets provide. As a result, both are important and necessary in an economy. In fact, the firms in countries with developed banking systems and capital markets grow faster and are more prosperous than those where either both or one of the two kinds of intermediary are undeveloped or are not operating correctly. Banks and in general holders of non-tradable claims like venture capitalists, provide an advisory service that markets cannot. However, the opportunity cost of capital on the latter is lower. Therefore, each intermediary dominates a different niche: a large and established corporation will resort directly to the market in order to obtain funds, because it has a good rating and is unwilling to pay intermediation costs; on the other hand, a company that lacks a strong reputation is more likely to require the advisory skills of the bank (or venture capitalist) and probably can even get cheaper funding from them, at the cost of providing more information on technology and operations, with the understanding that its financier will not have incentives to make that information public. The process of choosing the appropriate creditor also changes noticeably during the business cycle. When the risk-free rate and/or bank profits decline, corporations with the requisite conditions resort to the debt market to find finance, rather than going to the financial system. In fact, a fall in the tax-free rate reduces the cost of incurring debt on the debt market, which makes it more attractive. Conversely, falling bank profits lead to frictions among depositors and increases the opportunity cost of banking capital, which is reflected by increases in the cost of banking finance. In fact, capital markets usually acts as a back-up tool to keep financing going in recession periods, where banking credit (procyclical) becomes scarce. Banks usually provide savings and credit instruments in early stages of development, while capital market instruments emerge as the financial depth increases, new corporate or investor requirements arise and the degree of sophistication of both investors and financial agents grows. Capital markets facilitate the banking business by increasing the available options for risk management (e.g. allow them to hedge risks more effectively) while, at the same time, the banking activity provides for deeper capital markets. In Allen and Gale words the relationship is “symbiotic”. As a consequence, the ability to replace and complement each other provides the economy with a powerful tool to deal with both real and external shocks and contributes to achieve financial stability. In this sense, instead of posing an alternative between banks and capital markets, it appears to be more reasonable to highlight the convenience of achieving complementarities between both forms of intermediation, with each of them concentrating on the market segments for which they are fittest. In the emerging countries case, in particular, for long term growth it may be more relevant to search for a way to increase financial depth, rather than catering for the possible choice between banks and capital markets. 2 BIS Review 72/2007 
4.  Implications for monetary policy Differing degrees of capital markets participation relative to the banking system in the financial intermediation of an economy alter the significance of the monetary policy transmission channels. Specifically, a heavier weighting of the capital markets will increase the relevance of the asset prices channel compared with the credit channel. In this context, as a central banker it is worthwhile to reflect: What should a central bank do about the variations in asset prices in order to develop monetary policy and implement it? The first aspect is whether the monetary authority should bear in mind the asset prices directly (per se), do so indirectly due to the potential impacts on goods inflation or financial stability, or ignore them. Until now, stylized facts show that the sharp increases in asset prices combined with a rapid and sustained growth of credit precede the financial crisis, with their subsequent disruptive impacts on real output, so that ignoring them does not seem to be a sound strategy. However, financial innovation should not be ignored when defining the monetary policy design, which implies extremely complex analytical and practical issues: a) the central bank capacity to identify bubbles; b) whether it is capable of identifying if an event is temporary or permanent; c) uncertainty regarding the impact of asset prices on aggregate demand and inflation; d) the efficacy and relevance of the impact of the monetary policy on the asset markets; c) the asymmetries in the central bank responses (predicament to halt falls than to discourage rises). There is thus some agreement that it is not recommendable for the monetary authority to have an explicit target for asset inflation and to react systematically towards it. However, it has to cater for its development because the large oscillations in these markets have been associated with crises. In other words, an emphasis on risk management with stress testing is needed. My view is that we need to bear in mind the volatility of asset prices to design policies, but doing so in an informal and indirect way so as not to include it in the reaction function in a systematic manner. In this context some relevant questions appear: If the weighting of the asset price channel is raised, should its relevance in the monetary authority’s reaction function increase?; If the capital markets become more important in intermediating savings, is the degree of supervision of agents on that market adequate for the financial stability purpose? Is this degree of regulation comparable to that of the banking system? In recent years innovations in technology, the creation of new financial instruments and the subsequent appearance of new markets, as well as the abundant liquidity that there is in the world economy, have eroded the banking system’s role as a financial intermediary, in favor of the financial markets. Banks continue to serve as financial intermediaries, transferring capital and managing risks between debtors and depositors, but their share of the financial market grows is ever smaller. Regulatory restrictions, the growth of commercial securities, the development of markets for derivatives and for high-yield bonds, and the expansion of asset securitization were the main factors behind the displacement of the banking system. Likewise, improvements in information technologies made it easier for agents to assess the quality of the securities that are offered on the capital markets, favoring direct corporate finance by the public. In this sense, the information technology eroded the comparative advantage of banks by reducing the transaction costs and allowing other non-bank financial intermediaries to assess credit risk efficiently with statistical methods. While banks declined there was a parallel rise of financial markets, which have become steadily more complete. The greater “completeness” of markets, regarded as the expansion of the set of different kinds of available instruments and the reduction of transaction costs, brings with it a number of benefits that cannot be disregarded. In the first place, it enables the economic agents to insure for a broad range of risks, which is significant to reduce volatility. Moreover, it makes it easier for investors to fine tune their portfolios, which moderates the risk premium required on them and reduces the cost of capital for all agents. Finally, it enables the transformation of risks into negotiable instruments, which allows for their atomization. In fact, financial innovation has blurred the borders between typical commercial banking, investment banking, insurance and asset management. The whole system has become more interdependent, and old actors whose roles were eroded by new and upcoming stars have found new niches. Thus, commercial banks make loans that they repackage and sell to hedge funds, mutual funds and insurance companies (frequently bypassing investment banks), but hedge funds also do a lot of BIS Review 72/2007 3 
trading that improve the revenues of investment banks. Many companies bypass commercial banks completely and rely for funding in their initial stages on venture capitalists, that eventually resource to investment banks to float the companies in the stock market. All this in a framework where it is ever more common to observe financial institutions that diversify risks by transforming into massive financial supermarkets that provide services usually associated with commercial banks, investment banks and asset management. This state of affairs certainly means a huge challenge on central bankers and financial regulators. For us these developments might mean the sudden vanishing of a good part of what we knew about the transmission mechanisms by which monetary policy affects the real side of the economy and inflation, and especially its lags. The global financial imbalances, the lack of response of long term rates to tightening, the tame response of prices to the dollar devaluation against the euro, are all events hard to reconcile with the traditional knowledge. For regulators, the actual diversification of risks, and the resilience of the system to large shocks are questions of utmost interest that, however, do not have a proper answer at the moment. In the first case because its hard to know who owns what in terms of risk nowadays, and the other case because we can tell for sure if the shocks we have seen so far were really large enough. The collapse of LTCM in 1998, the dotcom bust in 2000, the Amaranth crash were very large shocks indeed, and the fact that we are wondering today whether they were large enough is, in itself, reason for satisfaction, if not complacency. 5.  Impact of intermediation on emerging economies In this context, emerging economies exhibit better macroeconomic management, which has significantly contributed to improving their financial position, as reflected by narrower spreads. However, the reasons for today’s narrow spreads in emerging markets are, in my opinion, beyond market changes resulting from structured products or credit default swaps or the emerging countries’ mostly sound fundamentals. In my view, many of the reasons lie in the gradual adjustment of global imbalances. An expectation that the US dollar will depreciate is leading investors to seek assets in other currencies. This is reflected in a clear trend towards developing local assets (mainly Asia but also Latin America) and, consequently, in narrower spreads and stock markets hitting record highs – in short, it results in higher funding opportunities for the emerging world. Such a process – which takes place gradually and is coupled with a transition towards a more diversified asset portfolio for central banks – offers great opportunities but also poses significant challenges for our countries, where financial development is incipient. Although they exhibit advances, Latin American countries appear to be lagging behind in terms of financial depth, not only compared to the developed countries but also when compared with other emerging economies like those in Eastern Asia. Latin American countries exhibit a lesser relative degree of banking penetration. This situation reflects both supply issues and problems inherent to the demand side. These demand difficulties relate to a large degree of informality in corporate operations, or cultural issues which mean that at times the economic agents exclude themselves from this market on their own free will. Bank loans to the private sector in Latin America is typically below 30% as fraction of GDP, while it is 175% in UK, 167 in Spain, and fluctuates closely to 100% in France, Japan, Italy, Canada, Australia and Germany. In emerging Asia, where contract enforcement is probably better than in Latin America, Thailand´s ratio is 88% and Korea´s 100. The development of capital markets appears to be even more incipient. These markets are relatively illiquid, fragmented and incomplete, because the instruments that enable them to diversify (or transfer) risks are scarce, and, in particular, the capital markets are concentrated on government securities. Indicators for 2004 show that while the turnover traded on the domestic capital markets was 6.1% of the GDP in Latin America, it accounted for 92.2% in the G-7 markets and for 104.5% in East Asia. On the other hand, during that year equity financing was 0.5% of the GDP in the region, compared with 1.5% in the G-7 countries and 5.9% in Asia. Between the years 1990 and 2004 Latin America suffered a decline in the number of listed corporations which contrasts with the growth trend observed in the G-7 countries and East Asia. 4 BIS Review 72/2007 
The domestic corporate bond markets exhibited a similar situation, as the amount of the bonds issued in 2004 was equivalent to 10.7% of the GDP in the Latin American countries, compared with averages of 47.7% in the G-7 countries and of 36.3% in the emerging Asian countries. Capitalization as a fraction of GDP is again lower than 30% in Latin America, while typically ranges from 80 to 140% of GDP in developed countries. In emerging Asia, Thailand´s market capitalization is 68% of GDP, 60% in India and 73% in Korea. In addition, the transactions carried out on the secondary market with government bonds are scarce when they are compared to those carried out on developed markets. Although the sovereign bonds are the assets with most liquidity, their level is not comparable to the mature markets. These characteristics are reflected in higher costs to issue and trade in these economies than in the developed economies, which feeds back to the shortage of products on domestic markets, because the greater integration of the capital markets leads the domestic agents to place funds on the international markets. 6.  How should financial depth be increased in emerging economies? Emerging economies, on top of dealing with a potential adjustment in global economic conditions have to confront our own uncertainties both at the micro and macro levels as the financial markets are being developed. In terms of building a regulatory and supervisory framework, it is key to develop common risk-focused approaches with a robust stress testing and a sounder market infrastructure, which allows for intermediaries to properly identify, transfer, transform and redistribute risk, enabling them to adjust to any financial or real shock. The main challenge to deepen the financial system is focused on generating a long-term domestic currency market, for which the fundamental requirement is to reduce the macroeconomic volatility so typical of the region. This development could be the most important buffer to cover against the new risks that emerge from financial innovation. For this purpose, the key consists in strengthening the pillars of what we might call the new economic paradigm, with several anti-cyclical components: • Fiscal solvency (primary surplus and improved liability management). • Monetary prudence and consistency (inflation at low and controlled levels). • Accumulation of international reserves (insurance against external shocks). • More flexible foreign exchange regimes • Reduction of net foreign debt • Trade dynamism (diversifying destinations and products). • Diminishing currency mismatches. Any policy design must have the flexibility necessary to be capable of responding to the appearance of new risks, bearing in mind the propagation that they might have on the rest of the economic sectors. Specifically, one of the major tasks in our countries is to foster bank penetration and to deepen credit in domestic currency. In general, our countries exhibit low levels of financial services usage when compared to other regions. For this purpose transparency and information dissemination is very relevant. It is necessary to design a regulatory framework which on one hand enables finance to be granted to non-traditional sectors, but which does not disregard the risks that the financial institutions incur. In this sense, supervision plays a fundamental role, as does the possibility of allowing for the requirements of a prudential nature that are imposed on financial institutions not to be uniform, but instead consider the particular characteristics of each institution. Because it has been shown that advances in technology have enabled both the inclusion of new products and lower costs mechanisms must be generated in order to stimulate the incorporation of technological progress. For example, a debtor’s risk assessment with mathematical methods (credit scoring) allows for a more efficient credit allocation. BIS Review 72/2007 5 
On the other hand, communication and policy coordination should be fostered between the different agencies with a role in direct or indirect regulation of financial markets. This coordination is necessary for the development of certain financial instruments that improve risk allocation. Central banks also have a specific interest in the improvement of domestic bond markets, in particular for public sector debt. One reason for this is that more complete markets reflect the relationship between borrowing costs and terms. Making an explicit yield curve reveals information about the expectations that the economic agents have, which is essential for business decisions. Recent experience has shown that the development of bond markets must be based on placing funds in domestic currency, which is not only relevant for the transmission of the monetary policy but also as a mechanism to reduce external vulnerability. Associated with this, the recent de-dollarization process should also be highlighted. In the past financial dollarization enabled the generation of a long term currency in a context of much distrust in the domestic currency as a result of long periods with high inflation. Although this allowed for a greater financial development (as long term instruments reappeared and by generating more liquidity) it proved to be vulnerable to the reversals of capital flows, in particular when accompanied by exchange rate rigidity. Although the balance sheets of the financial intermediaries did not exhibit a mismatch in the asset and liability denominations, there was another concrete mismatch: the revenues of debtors in dollars were not always denominated in that currency. This example shows that there are no shortcuts for deepening the financial markets. The de-dollarization should act in this direction, while the prudential regulation bears in mind possible mismatches that exceed the denomination of the financial instruments (for instance: limiting loans in foreign currency to export activities only or to those who generate foreign currency revenues). Carrying out the policies mentioned above does not mean blindly following certain recipes that must be applied always and under any circumstances. This acknowledges that there are different ways of putting into practice the adequate policies to achieve a stable and deep financial market. Moreover, it is not only necessary to identify the adequate economic policies for a country under specific circumstances, but correct timing is also crucial when implementing the measures. The pace at which policies are implemented cannot be independent from the structural characteristics, nor the economic and social environment in any particular country. Therefore, the pace selected should allow for maximizing the chances that the process undertaken will be successful. In summary, in several cases the choices of adequate policies to attain a predictable economic environment calls for an adequate combination of credibility and flexibility.

Timothy Ridley: What makes the Cayman Islands a successful international financial services centre? Background paper by Mr Timothy Ridley, Chairman of the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority, at the Caribbean Investment Forum, Montego Bay, Jamaica, 12-13 June 2007.  In developing this paper, CIMA is indebted to Ms Deborah Drummond, Deputy Financial Secretary in the Portfolio of Finance & Economics, on whose 2006 presentation to Case Western Law School we have relied heavily. *      *      * Introduction The Cayman Islands’ development into one of the world's largest international financial services centres is based on a combination of fundamental core factors – providing the infrastructure, services and operational freedom and flexibility for international investors and businesses on a foundation of stable, certain, intelligent and balanced political, economic, social, legal and regulatory regimes. The financial services sector was essentially founded by Cayman investing its “historic capital”: English common law and tax neutrality (non-discriminatory absence of direct taxes), both dating from the 1700s. Political, economic and social stability completed the platform. A brief history lesson Some of the significant decisions and events that shaped the development of the industry over the last 40 years are set out below. Phase One – 1966 to 1976 The sector was established with the enactment of a handful of laws in 1966, including the Banks and Trust Companies Regulation Law, the Trusts Law and the Exchange Control Regulations Law. The Companies Law had been enacted earlier in 1960 (and with much amendment and enhancement continues to be a crucial part of the legislative infrastructure). In the decade from 1966 to 1976, the sector took root, significantly assisted by political uncertainty in the Bahamas and the development of the Eurodollar market (itself in turn thanks to US interest equalisation tax). At the end of 1976, there were 7,521 registered companies, 126 banks & trusts with assets of US$21.9 billion, and 1 captive insurance company. Contributing to the local stability was the decision in 1970 for the Cayman Islands to begin issuing its own currency. Prior to this Cayman had used the Jamaican dollar as legal tender, a carry-over from the Cayman’s history as a dependency of Jamaica. It was felt that, in view of the rapid progress of the Cayman economy, it would be to the Islands’ economic and political advantage for the jurisdiction to have its own currency and a Currency Board (now the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority). Further cementing the Cayman currency’s stability was the 1974 decision to delink the currency from sterling and to tie it to the US dollar a relationship that exists today. The country has always enjoyed a healthy surplus in the reserves backing the Cayman dollar. Cayman’s resident population was around 13,000 in 1974. Phase Two – 1976 to 1986 In 1976, the Confidential Relationships (Preservation) Law (a codification of English common law) was enacted to protect confidential information in the possession of financial services professionals from improper disclosure as a response to aggressive action by the U.S. authorities at the time to obtaining information from offshore banks. All exchange control restrictions were abolished during the late 1970’s. The Insurance Law was enacted in 1979, to enhance and regulate the growing captive insurance industry (driven initially by (illfounded) concerns about political stability in Bermuda). There followed again a decade of growth, during which Cayman came into its own in financial services, notably in banking, captive insurance and general financial transactions (e.g., the first euro-bond issue by the Cayman subsidiary of a Japanese shipping company). Towards the end of this period, in 1984, the Cayman Islands entered into the Narcotics Agreement with the U.S., which matured into the BIS Review 72/2007 1 
Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty in 1986. At the end of 1986, there were 16,791 registered companies, 456 banks & trusts with assets of US$202 billion, 6 company managers and 107 captive insurance companies. Phase Three – 1986 to 1996 During the decade 1986 to 1996, robust financial services activity continued over a wide array of areas, notably in on and off-balance sheet secured and unsecured financing, mutual funds and captives. During this time, the regulatory infrastructure became more developed, particularly with the enactment of the Mutual Funds Law in 1993, which provided a secure and clear framework for the fund industry. The Trusts Law and other legislation continued to be amended to maintain Cayman’s edge in financial services. At the end of 1996, there were 37,919 registered companies, 575 banks & trusts with assets of US$507.8 billion, 75 company managers, 378 captive insurance companies, 121 mutual fund administrators and 1379 mutual funds. Phase Four – 1996 to today In 1996, the Proceeds of Criminal Conduct Law and related anti money laundering regulations were enacted, and was one of the first in the region “all-crimes” anti-money laundering legislation; and the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (CIMA) was established to replace the Financial Services Supervision Department. In 1997, the Cayman Islands Stock Exchange (CSX) was established. In May 2000, Cayman committed to entering into controlled bilateral on-request arrangements for assisting Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) member states in tax matters. The first of these was the Tax Information Exchange Agreement signed with the U.S.A in November 2001, with an operative date of 1 January 2004. In June 2000, despite its demonstrated track record in anti-money laundering Cayman found itself on the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) list of non-cooperative countries. We were successful in being removed from that list in June 2001. Cayman also agreed to implement the automatic reporting of interest payments under the EU Savings Directive (EUSD) which became effective 1st July 2005. A key benefit secured by Cayman was that all but one of its mutual fund categories were agreed to be “out-of-scope” of the EUSD. The Securities Investment Business Law was enacted in 2001 and provided for the licensing of investment managers and advisors. At the end of 2001, mid-way through the decade 1996-2006, there were 64,495 registered companies, 427 banks with total assets of over US$800 billion, 3,648 mutual funds, 542 captive insurance companies, 418 listings on the CSX with a market cap of US$38.1 billion, 92 company managers, and 217 mutual fund administrators. In 2002, CIMA became fully independent operationally in keeping with international expectations and standards. In late 2003, Cayman was assessed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and received a report confirming substantial compliance with international regulatory standards, with particular emphasise on the strong and effective anti money laundering culture. Current The financial industry continues to show strong growth in most areas. Figures for year-end 2006 show the number of active registered companies had grown to 81,783, a 27% increase from 2005. The CSX had 1,225 listings with total market capitalization of US$111.5 billion, after reaching its milestone of 1,000 listings in 2005. Investment funds grew to 8,134 an increase of 14%. Cayman continues to be the world’s number one domicile for hedge funds and for structured finance transactions. We also continue to hold our own as the number two jurisdiction after Bermuda for captive insurance companies, with consistent growth to 740 as at December 2006. The number of trust companies and company managers remains relatively stable with some modest growth in the number of private trust companies. The lone departure from the numerical growth trend is on the banking side, where consolidation and cost-efficiency considerations continue to have an impact, with the number of licensees at the end of 2006 down 3% from 2005 to 291. However, the quantum of assets on deposit (overwhelmingly 2 BIS Review 72/2007 
institutional funds) at around US$1.4 trillion continues to climb, with Cayman remaining by far the biggest offshore bank booking centre. Cayman continues to update and enhance its key regulatory laws and regulations and anti money laundering regime to maintain its competitive position and to meet appropriate international standards. The resident population is now over 50,000, i.e. nearly 400% growth in 33 years. This brief historical review not only demonstrates the consistent growth that Cayman has experienced as an international financial services centre, but shows that growth has gone hand in hand with policy and legislative development and international cooperation. Where is Cayman going? Successive Governments have maintained a firm commitment to providing the necessary policy and legislation to facilitate orderly development as Cayman has ventured into new sectors, to support innovation, to safeguard its industry from abuse and to fulfil its international obligations as it has advanced to become a major participant in global financial services. Set out below is what Cayman is now doing and how it does it, and highlights the main challenges. Philosophy Cayman takes a principled and pragmatic approach to the development of the financial services industry in the Cayman Islands. In terms of principles, our “operating manual” is based on • Adherence to recognized relevant international standards – Cayman fully accepts that it should adhere to generally accepted and applied international standards – and not just as they are, but as they evolve. Cayman’s experience has been that it is not absence of regulation that has promoted business, but the introduction of sensible and balanced regulation as circumstances demanded. The growth of the financial services industry over the last four decades is proof of this. • Proportionality of regulation – the jurisdiction operates on the principle that, before a regulatory measure is introduced, we must be satisfied that it is necessary, it is appropriate given the nature of financial services business in the Cayman Islands, it is proportional to the identified risks, we understand the regulatory impact and its benefits outweigh its costs. • Respect for the rule of law, due process and the right to privacy of personal financial information – this speaks for itself. • Progressive reinforcement of our international cooperation channels – evidenced by the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty and Tax Information Exchange Agreement with the U.S.A; the Proceeds of Criminal Conduct Law; the Monetary Authority Law; the Terrorism Law; the Criminal Justice (International Cooperation) Law; and willingness to negotiate additional agreements for cross border cooperation and information exchange with key jurisdictions. • Constructive engagement on international issues in the provision of cross-border financial services – based on a level playing field and encompassing equity, fair competition, transparency and non-discrimination. These all promote legal and commercial certainty and control reputational risk for Cayman and users of the jurisdiction. The tools Public sector infrastructure The public sector support infrastructure includes a number of key institutions. These are: • Minister, International Financial Services Policy – with oversight of two key bodies – the Financial Services Council and the Private Sector Consultative Committee. BIS Review 72/2007 3 
• Portfolio of Finance & Economics – under the leadership of the Financial Secretary, Deputy Financial Secretary, also includes The Secretariat (policy), Public Relations Unit, Tax Information Exchange Authority, Anti Money-Laundering Steering Group. • CIMA – regulates the financial sector, (including monitoring for compliance with AML/CFT requirements), i.e. banks, money services providers, trust companies, securities (investment funds, fund administrators, brokers, investment managers), insurance (captives, general, managers, and agents), company managers and corporate service providers. • General Registry – registry for companies, exempted partnerships & trusts, patents & trademarks. • Cayman Islands Stock Exchange – from its start as a listing facility for Cayman Islands’ specialist products, mutual funds and debt securities, the CSX has emerged as an innovative, global gateway to accessing capital markets in ten years. • Financial Reporting Authority – similar to U.S.-based FINCen, UK NCIS and other international financial crime reporting agencies around the world. Private sector The private sector is a critical component of the infrastructure. Over the years Cayman has built up a world-class cadre of professionals who have facilitated specialization in institutional high value business. Our growing law firms routinely rank very highly in these main areas of specialization, and all of the “Big 4” accounting & auditing firms have significant offices here. Among our banks are 43 of the top 50 international banking houses. There is a large number of top quality service providers for fund administration, insurance and company management and fiduciary services, both independently owned and members of well-known international groups. The special relationship The relationship between the Government and the private sector is one of the strengths of the Cayman Islands’ financial industry. There is a culture of consultation and cooperation. At the central Government level this is facilitated through the two bodies already mentioned, the Financial Services Council and the Private Sector Consultative Committee. These two standing groups provide Government with valuable advice, input and feedback on financial and economic initiatives. Private sector consultation is also a formal requirement for CIMA. The Monetary Authority Law stipulates that prior consultation must occur before the regulator issues or amends rules or statements of principle or guidance regarding the conduct of licensees. Industry-CIMA-Government working groups are frequently used to address sectors requiring attention. Recent examples are the insurance and mutual fund industries. Challenges The high tax v low tax battle The principal ongoing challenge for the Cayman Islands, and one faced by other small financial services centres, is the pressure from leading economic powers (and their client international agencies such as the OECD) to curtail the activities of these centres, that are seen as diverting tax revenue from the public coffers of these higher tax jurisdictions. The latest initiative is the current offensive in the United States Congress against perceived “tax havens” by proposed new tax legislation blacklisting such centres and deterring U.S. taxpayers from using them. The Cayman Islands is responding to this with efforts to ensure that decision-makers and influencers understand the Cayman Islands regime and our associated international cooperation channels, as well as the effectiveness of those channels (particularly under the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty and the Tax Information Exchange Agreement with the U.S.). Cayman is also actively considering tax information exchange agreements, double tax treaties or comprehensive tax agreements with key jurisdictions. Its position is that there must be real and measurable benefits to Cayman under any such agreements. 4 BIS Review 72/2007 
International standard setters Cayman has been periodically challenged by international standard setters with their establishment and revision of standards, which Cayman and similar jurisdictions usually have not had a hand in developing, and the resulting sanctions unilaterally imposed for perceived non-compliance. As mentioned above, Cayman was placed on the FATF list of noncooperative countries in 2000. It also felt the brunt of the OECD’s harmful tax competition initiative during that period, and subsequent initiatives since that time. The primary strategy is to engage these standards setters in dialogue so as better to inform them as to the regulatory regime in Cayman and to secure Cayman’s early participation in framing international standards that are accepted and applied by all. Currently, Cayman is engaged in this exercise with the International Organisation of Securities Commissioners (IOSCO) and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS). The Caribbean Financial Action Task Force mutual evaluation now underway and the IMF assessment in late 2007 will provide further opportunities for dialogue. Other challenges • Natural and man-man shocks – Hurricane Ivan in 2004 underscored Cayman’s vulnerability to natural disasters, in particular hurricanes. The financial sector proved itself very resilient in the aftermath of Ivan, thanks in part to its business continuity planning. However there were areas of weakness, and since that time industry and Government have been working to address these. The Government has strengthened its ability to handle large-scale emergencies with the recent establishment of an emergency management agency. CIMA has also issued a statement of guidance on business continuity for all licensees. • Immigration/Human Resources – there is a worldwide shortage of skilled labour to support the financial services industry. Cayman is an expensive location in which to do business and live. Just as Cayman has been the beneficiary of outsourcing of financial transactions from high tax and overregulated jurisdictions, so it must accept that many support functions will be outsourced by its service providers to lower cost jurisdictions. This makes it ever important that Cayman focuses on delivering high value added services and providing better education and opportunities for the local community while continuing to welcome those with the needed skills that Cayman has not yet developed at home.

Nout Wellink: Basel II and financial institution resiliency Remarks by Dr Nout Wellink, President of the Netherlands Bank and Chairman of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, at the “Risk Capital 2007” conference, Paris, 27 June 2007. *      *      * Introduction I am pleased to join you today to speak about Basel II and financial institution resiliency. I would first like to commend the conference organisers for putting together such a comprehensive programme of events this week.  I am grateful for the opportunity to discuss the Basel II Framework and how it was designed to help make banks more resilient in the face of turbulent waters and constantly shifting currents. Resilience comes from the Latin word for “rebound”, which implies change from the status quo and change is the only constant in the business of banking. Banks sometimes need to adjust to unexpected and unwanted shocks, though change also arises in a more positive way, such as innovation. Today I will focus on our changing financial landscape and how the work of the Basel Committee and, most notably, the Basel II framework helps firms and financial systems to become more resilient to these changes. From my perspective, financial resiliency has three distinct elements. First, it includes the existence and promotion of sound economic and financial policies. The second element is a resilient financial market infrastructure underpinning the system, which includes sound payment systems, robust exchanges, prudent accounting standards and sensible governance standards. Third, it is essential to have robust and resilient core firms at the centre of the financial system operating on safe and sound risk management practices. A sound global capital adequacy framework is critical to ensure the robustness and resilience of these firms. It is on this third dimension that Basel II plays an important role and on which I will focus my remarks.  Basel II – general We are witnessing a rapidly changing financial environment, which in some cases represents a sea change from traditional practices. We have seen significant advances in technology and financial product innovation that have reshaped the role played by banks in the credit process. An example is the shift in business models. Core institutions are moving away from traditional buy-and-hold strategies to an originate-to-distribute or market-based model. Changes such as these create new challenges – as well as new opportunities – for bankers as well as for supervisors. Innovation has led to new techniques and tools for managing credit portfolios and this has been accompanied by increased complexity. A regulatory framework based on a simple risk weight scheme has become less and less effective in assessing an appropriate level of regulatory capital against these new, complex risk exposures.  Basel II – Pillar 1 The Basel Committee’s response has been to capitalise on the improvements in banks’ risk management systems to better address the complexity and innovation that we see today. This is reflected in the first pillar of the framework that relates to minimum capital requirements. In order to meet the challenges, the Committee leverages off the core building blocks of banks’ risk management systems, namely the probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default. These are concepts that are integral to the risk management systems developed by large banks. By utilising these concepts, Basel II provides a more meaningful signal between risk taking and capital. This, in turn, reinforces sound risk measurement techniques and the framework is sufficiently flexible to accommodate new techniques and products.  There are many aspects of Basel II that were drawn from modern risk management techniques and industry best practice. Banks themselves have indicated that Basel II has produced improvements in their risk management processes by spurring innovative work in several important areas. Let me give you a few concrete examples to illustrate this.  BIS Review 72/2007 1 
First, under Basel II, we have seen substantial advances in operational risk measurement and management, particularly with respect to complex risk transfer arrangements. Since the Basel II discussions began in the late 1990s, there has been a tremendous increase in research on operational risk, including the forms it can take, the ways in which it arises, measurement methods and techniques to mitigate the risk. As a result, the industry has witnessed a surge of innovation and development in these areas. Second, with respect to stressed conditions, Basel II seeks to advance comprehensive stress testing frameworks and risk management practices more generally. Strong risk management is a critical component of a bank’s ability to withstand shocks. The Basel II framework requires that stress scenarios capture the effects of a downturn on market and credit risks, as well as on liquidity. Such an improved firm-wide approach to risk assessment is essential to ensuring that banks have a sufficient capital buffer that will carry them through difficult periods.  Third, Basel II better assesses the risk inherent in arrangements using evolving technologies, such as securitisation and credit derivatives, that are used to buy and sell credit risk. This is clearly evident in the originate-to-distribute model. Basel II provides a framework that allows supervisors to focus discussions with banks on the robustness of their risk measurement and management of the complex financial instruments that are typically used in this model. Basel II also establishes benchmarks for recognising risk transfer and mitigation in securitisation and credit derivatives structures. It sets a boundary between the point at which a firm transfers risk and actually retains the risk. These enable supervisors to assess the degree of risk transfer and mitigation under both normal and stressed market conditions.  And finally, Basel II requires that firms strengthen their frameworks for assessing appropriate capital for the trading book. This has taken on increasing importance given the rapid growth of trading book assets relative to the banking book. For example – the Basel Committee – in consultation with the industry – continues to work on developing a framework for better capturing the default risk associated with credit exposures in the trading book. In addition, Basel II permits firms to use their own models to measure counterparty credit risk exposures. This risk arises, for example, in OTC derivatives, which are becoming increasingly complex and more difficult to measure. This approach is closely aligned with industry best practice as well as the underlying economic risks of these activities. Basel II has also paved the way for improvements in other, less visible ways. One example is Basel II’s greater focus on firms’ risk management infrastructure. For instance, the Framework requires fundamental improvement in the data supporting PD, LGD, and EAD estimates that underpin economic and regulatory capital assessments over an economic cycle. This has spurred improvements in areas such as data collection and management information systems. These advances, along with the incentives to improve risk management practices, will support further innovation and improvement in risk management and economic capital modelling.  Pillar 2 Let me now turn to the second pillar – the supervisory review process. Pillar 2 really starts with you, the banks. First and foremost, responsibility lies with bank management for developing an internal capital assessment process and setting capital targets that are commensurate with the bank’s risk profile and control environment. A sound risk management process is the basis for an effective assessment of the adequacy of a bank’s capital. And bank management bears the primary responsibility for ensuring that the bank maintains adequate capital to support the risks beyond the minimum requirements. Excessive participation by supervisors in a bank's capital adequacy assessment process or firms' over-reliance on supervisory review of their assessments are both counter to Basel II’s objectives and raise the risk of moral hazard. The better banks measure and manage their risks, the more comfortable supervisors and the market will become with respect to their Pillar 1 processes, as well as the amount of overall capital that Pillar 2 indicates is appropriate.  This is not a compliance exercise! Senior management and boards of directors need to lead the process and ensure that their institutions establish robust internal systems that capture all material risks for their institution in a rigorous manner. Management should make certain that the economic substance of risk exposures is fully recognised and incorporated into the bank’s systems. This is extremely important, particularly in the instance of securitisation and other complex risk transfer arrangements where the risks retained by the firm are more difficult to measure. These estimates of risk must translate into robust capital assessments that can be validated by banks and supervisors. 2 BIS Review 72/2007 
When supervisors assess economic capital, they should leverage off of banks’ systems. Supervisors need to understand the global perspective within which banks operate. Local approaches may be warranted, but we need to ensure that local deviations are proportionate and that the costs do not outweigh the prudential benefits. To achieve the full benefits of Pillar 2, supervisors need to avoid falling into the trap of establishing a check-list approach to supervision. It is not in anyone’s interest to engage in a tick-the-box compliance exercise. Let me stress this - Basel II goes beyond merely just meeting the letter of the rules. The framework is more about a risk-focused approach to capital and risk management.  I understand that for banks and supervisors to realise the full potential of Basel II, more work must be done on home-host issues. With respect to Pillar 1, we have resolved a number of concerns and have come quite a long way. The same vigour and energy needs to be applied to the home-host issues related to Pillar 2. I am confident that with the development of the home-host principles, increased use of the supervisory colleges and further dialogue with the industry we will make progress on the outstanding issues. Many of these Pillar 2 issues, such as diversification, are particularly challenging and supervisors need to work with the industry to resolve them.  I expect that over time bankers and supervisors will engage in a dialogue around Pillar 2 that ultimately will turn out to be one of the most important benefits coming out of the implementation of Basel II. For instance, I have already heard from a number of banks about the fruitful discussions of how credit risk mitigation is reflected in their risk models and about the robustness of risk measures for complex structured products. I have also heard discussions about how diversification is treated in risk management systems and how the dialogue surrounding credit risk stress testing is becoming more focused.  Pillar 3 Since the release of the Basel II framework, most of the focus has been on the first two pillars but we should not forget the third – and certainly not the least – of the three pillars. Market discipline is made possible by effective disclosure requirements and is a critical complement to the other two pillars of Basel II. Indeed, in the light of recent and rapid financial innovation, state of the art disclosure needs to keep up.  Basel II seeks to raise the bar on the quality of disclosures, especially related to more complex credit risk intermediation activities, covering areas such as counterparty risk, securitisation and credit risk mitigants. It provides clearer industry benchmarks and its required qualitative disclosures will allow banks to put their quantitative disclosures into context and help explain their approach to risk management. To help advance the use of market discipline, Pillar 3 disclosures are, in many instances, required to utilise an advanced Pillar 1 approach, such as the internal ratings-based approach or the recognition of securitisation. This will help the industry move forward collectively. Further, Pillar 3 disclosures will enhance discipline around risk measures since banks must show the actual outcomes versus estimates. An example of this is the required disclosure of actual losses compared with estimated losses in the preceding period for each IRB portfolio, combined with qualitative information to explain the outcomes. However, challenges remain. There needs to be more discussion with a broader group of institutions to discuss their views regarding Pillar 3. In particular, banks have expressed their concern about the potential for misinterpretation of the purportedly complex disclosures by investors and the market in general. Another concern relates to potential inconsistencies and differences across banks and the unclear signal this may send to the users of such disclosures. Clearly, broad dialogue on this topic involving supervisors, bankers and market participants is necessary to prevent any unintended consequences. A strong understanding by the market of Pillars 1 and 2 will make Pillar 3 more understandable and market discipline a more reliable tool for supervisors and the market.  Before I conclude I would like to say a few words about the costs associated with Basel II’s implementation and compliance, particularly costs related to information technology and human resources. Clearly, a shift in capital regulation as fundamental as Basel II entails significant transition costs for both banks and supervisors. However, even in the absence of Basel II, well managed financial institutions would have continued to update and improve their IT systems and risk management practices simply to keep pace with the evolving marketplace. Basel II has pushed firms BIS Review 72/2007 3 
further than they may have gone on their own. In addition, Basel II confers other benefits, including greater operational efficiencies, better capital allocation and greater shareholder value through the use of improved risk models and reporting capabilities. One might reasonably expect such improvements to lead to more consistent profits and reduced volatility of credit losses as a result of consistent risk spreading, more effective deployment of capital, and the ability to make better business decisions.  Conclusion I would like to close by reiterating the importance of Basel II in support of financial resiliency, especially in this age of rapid change and innovation. Basel II encourages better measurement and management of risk exposures and the treatment of complex financial instruments. It seeks to advance the practice of stress testing as well as other risk management techniques. Under Pillar 2, banks take the lead in developing internal risk management processes that support robust estimates of regulatory and economic capital. Through enhanced transparency and market discipline, Pillar 3 will become more important because of increasing intermediation of risk through the capital markets. Both banks and supervisors need to take a long-term perspective when considering the benefits of Basel II. Regulatory capital, risk management and risk-based supervision are aligned in a more consistent manner that can accommodate financial innovation. This capital framework is a long-term investment that if done properly will lay the foundation for further evolution. It is through strong coordination among supervisors and with you – the industry – that we can realise the full potential of the Basel II framework. Thank you. 4 BIS Review 72/2007 
Jean-Pierre Roth: SNB commemorative publication “The Swiss National Bank 1907-2007” Remarks by Mr Jean-Pierre Roth, Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank for International Settlements, at the launch of the commemorative publication “The Swiss National Bank 1907–2007”, Zurich, 21 June 2007. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen It is with pleasure and some pride that I present our commemorative publication today or – as the German language puts it so well – our festschrift, or celebratory work. There is indeed good reason to celebrate. One hundred years of doing business, crowned for the most part with success, certainly warrants celebration. The publication of a festschrift is one of the events being held to mark this anniversary. It is the fourth such work to be published, following on from those of 1932, 1957 and 1982. It is somewhat different, however, insofar as it commemorates an entire century of the National Bank’s existence. We wanted this commemorative publication to be a learned work, which at the same time is accessible to a very broad readership. We wanted it to be both unpretentious and modern, yet in keeping with the tradition of the previous works. I make no secret of the fact that significant resources were deployed to prepare the book. Work first started over three years ago and some fifty or so bank employees were involved in the project. The work which I am presenting to you today is divided into three sections. The first tells the history of the SNB over the first seventy-five years of its existence. As the previous commemorative publications have already dealt in detail with this period, it was no longer necessary to recount all the events again. We thought that it would be more interesting to take a fresh and critical look at certain episodes from a historical perspective. This is why we called upon the services of three distinguished economists and historians, asking them to explore this period, and leaving them free to choose the salient points of their analysis. Michael Bordo of Rutgers University and Harold James of Princeton University took a detailed look into the first half-century of the SNB, in other words, from its Jean-Pierre Roth SNB founding in 1907 to the end of the Second World War. An exciting yet troubled time, which included the surge in inflation that came in the aftermath of the First World War, the laborious return to the gold standard, the 1936 devaluation, and the SNB’s activities during the Second World War. Peter Bernholz of the University of Basel is the author of the second chapter within this first part. He devoted himself to the period from 1945 to the early 1980s, including the return to convertibility, the Bretton Woods period, the transition to flexible exchange rates and initial experiences with an autonomous monetary policy. I am pleased to point out that the doors of the SNB’s archives were opened unreservedly to these authors. The second part of the publication is more traditional. It is devoted to the last twenty-five years and deals with various aspects of the SNB’s activities and its nature, ranging from monetary policy to the governance of the bank and including the new emphasis placed on financial stability, changing international relations, the renewed statutory framework in which we operate, and the adoption of a modern approach to managing our currency reserves. This second section, divided into eight chapters, was penned entirely by bank staff. We did not want a purely descriptive text. On the contrary, we asked the authors to adopt an analytical, critical approach, concentrating on key issues. In order to recognise the authors and their contribution to the book – and this is a departure from the previous commemorative works – they have been personally named at the beginning of each article. Some forty in-house authors contributed to the work. For the third and last part of the book, which looks to the future, we took a step back. We called on the services of eight Swiss and foreign economists, all specialists of global renown, asking them to discuss those issues of greatest concern to today’s central banks. We asked Ernst Baltensperger of the University of Berne to provide a more academic assessment of the SNB’s monetary policy over the last twenty-five years. We called upon Marvin Goodfriend of Carnegie Mellon University to give his views on the optimum inflation rate, Frederic Mishkin of Columbia University to write about the policy of inflation targeting and to tell us to what extent it is truly a new phenomenon, and William White of BIS Review 71/2007 1 
the Bank for International Settlements in Basel to address the difficult question of whether price stability is really enough. Manfred Neumann from the University of Bonn was asked to provide an assessment of fixed and flexible exchange rate systems, Peter Kenen of Princeton University to give us his opinion on the need for foreign exchange reserves in flexible exchange rate systems, Martin Hellwig from the Max Planck Institute in Bonn to reveal his thinking on the co-existence of the Swiss franc and the euro, and Alexander Swoboda of the Graduate Institute of International Studies in Geneva to share his ideas with us on the reform of the international monetary system. This third section, which is aimed rather more than the first two sections at a specialised audience, is available in English only. The two other sections, meanwhile, are available in French, German, Italian and English. It only remains for me to that I hope you will find the book both engaging and interesting. To whet your appetite – and here my comments are aimed particularly at the representatives of the press – I should like to stress that we have been particularly transparent and candid in preparing this work, something which was probably inconceivable just twenty-five years ago. So start looking for the scoops which, no doubt, are hiding within the pages of the book – happy hunting! 2 BIS Review 71/2007 
Njuguna Ndung’u: Workshop on the compilation of banking statistics in Kenya Address by Prof Njuguna Ndung’u, Governor of the Central Bank of Kenya, at the opening of the workshop on the compilation of banking statistics, Kenya School of Monetary Studies, Nairobi, 12 June 2007.  *      *      * Mr. Kevin O’Connor, Consultant IMF  Mr. Oliver Chinganya, Regional Advisor, GDDS Project  The representatives of:   Kenya Banker’s Association (KBA),   Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Kenya (ICPAK) and   Central Bureau of Statistics  Distinguished Participants,  Ladies and Gentlemen,  Let me first and foremost welcome you all to the Kenya School of Monetary Studies and to this very important workshop on the compilation of banking statistics. I must thank you for taking time off to attend this function.  I wish to thank the IMF consultant in particular for finding time to participate in this workshop as a resource person. As you may be aware, the IMF has played a major role in the development of monetary statistics in Kenya and in countries around the world. In particular, the Fund, in collaboration with the Department for International Development (DFID), continues to support the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) project which aims at improving the availability and quality of data in developing countries to conform with international standards. Kenya, as a country, being part of the GDDS project, provides an important avenue for database improvements. This workshop is therefore part of the greater plan towards the improvement of statistics in Kenya with the support of these organisations. I thank them for this contribution.  Ladies and Gentlemen,  My task today is to open this workshop but before I do that let me draw your attention to the importance of this workshop and statistics in general. You will recall that the financial crisis that hit the Asian economies in the early 1990s was partly occasioned by lack of sufficient statistical information on what was going on in the banking system. I am glad therefore that thereafter, the world economies have taken initiatives to ensure that statistical capacities and developments are at the forefront so as to inform decision making at all levels. We at the Central Bank have not been left behind. Over the past few years, the Bank has been working on the improvement of monetary and financial statistics to meet the international compilation standards guided by the recommendations of the IMF mission on Report for Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC), and Plans for improvements under the GDDS project. Implementation of some of the recommendations cannot be done without a joint effort with statistical officers in the financial sector, most of whom are present here today.  Ladies and Gentlemen,  There are varied uses of the banking data. The Government uses it, among other data, for economic planning. The Central Bank uses it for the formulation and implementation of monetary policy and monitoring of the financial system. The challenge currently for example is to monitor portfolio capital flows and disentangle from remittances. I am sure all the institutions represented here make use of data in one way or another. For example, consolidated banking statistics are normally shared with the banking industry. This is not to mention other users of our statistics including the private sector, international investors and researchers.  With such an immense use, it is important that the data collected is accurate and reliable. Secondly, the dynamic nature of our economies necessitates that we become dynamic in our approach to data compilation. New innovations, for example, new financial instruments, which impact on the monetary policy formulation and implementation, continue to come up. It is in this regard that the Central Bank has produced a revised draft data reporting form which will be discussed in this workshop.  BIS Review 71/2007 1 
Ladies and gentlemen,  Besides the accuracy, and reliability time is of the essence in data compilation and dissemination. Data must be up to date and accurate. I therefore urge you all to observe CBK deadlines for the submission of the various returns as indicated in the various Banking Circulars. As far as having accurate and reliable data is concerned, we are all together, not just as a country, but with the rest of the world.  As I conclude, let me welcome you once again to KSMS. To get maximum benefits from this workshop I urge all the participants to actively contribute in discussions and raise with the resource persons any issues that you think present grey areas.  It is now my pleasure to declare the workshop officially open.  Thank you.  2 BIS Review 71/2007 
Usha Thorat: Financial inclusion – the Indian experience Speech by Ms Usha Thorat, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the HMT-DFID Financial Inclusion Conference 2007, London, 19 June 2007. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen, I thank Her Majesty’s Treasury and DFID for organising this conference and inviting the Reserve Bank of India to share India’s experiences in achieving greater financial inclusion (FI).  We, in India, have been greatly impressed by the focused attention being paid by the UK Government to the subject of FI. I had read a very detailed report by the British Banker’s Association in 2000 dwelling upon the issues involved in providing greater access to financial services and the concept of a basic banking account. The setting up the Financial Inclusion Task Force and the Financial Inclusion Fund reflect the priority attached by the Government to the subject. DFID has been involved in a number of livelihood diversification projects in India and other countries especially for the marginalised and DFID’s stake in the subject obviously derives from the development aspect of FI. The interest shown by authorities in different countries in FI clearly show that there are concerns that large segments of the world’s population are excluded from formal payments system and financial markets while financial markets are developing and globalising rapidly. There is an obvious market failure and thus governments and financial sector regulators are seeking to create enabling conditions such that markets become more open, more competitive, affordable and inclusive.  Focus of financial inclusion in India The Indian economy is growing at a steady rate of 8.5 % to 9% in the last five years or so. Most of the growth is from industry and services sector. Agriculture is growing at a little over 2 %. The potential for growth in the primary and SME sector is enormous. Limited access to affordable financial services such as savings, loan, remittance and insurance services by the vast majority of the population in the rural areas and unorganised sector is believed to be acting as a constraint to the growth impetus in these sectors. Access to affordable financial services – especially credit and insurance – enlarges livelihood opportunities and empowers the poor to take charge of their lives. Such empowerment aids social and political stability. Apart from these benefits, FI imparts formal identity, provides access to the payments system and to savings safety net like deposit insurance. Hence FI is considered to be critical for achieving inclusive growth; which itself is required for ensuring overall sustainable overall growth in the country.  The approach to FI in developing countries such as India is thus somewhat different from the developed countries. In the latter, the focus is on the relatively small share of population not having access to banks or the formal payments system whereas in India, we are looking at the majority who are excluded.  FI can be thought of in two ways. One is exclusion from the payments system –i.e. not having access to a bank account. The second type of exclusion is from formal credit markets, requiring the excluded to approach informal and exploitative markets. After nationalisation of major banks in India in 1969, there was a significant expansion of branch network to unbanked areas and stepping up of lending to agriculture, small industry and business. More recently, the focus is on establishing the basic right of every person to have access to affordable basic banking services.  BIS Review 71/2007 1 
Measures of financial exclusion    One common measure of FI is the percentage of adult population having bank accounts (Chart-1). Going by the available data on the number of savings bank accounts and assuming that one person has only one account, (which assumption may not be correct as many persons could have more than one bank account) we find that on an all India basis 59 per cent of adult population in the country have bank accounts – in other words 41 per cent of the population is unbanked. In rural areas the coverage is 39 per cent against 60 per cent in urban areas. The unbanked population is higher in the North Eastern and Eastern regions.     The extent of exclusion from credit markets is much more, as number of loan accounts constituted only 14 per cent of adult population (Chart-2). In rural areas, the coverage is 9.5 per cent against 14 per cent in urban areas. Regional differences are significant with the credit coverage at 25 per cent for the Southern Region and as low as 7, 8 and 9 per cent respectively in North Eastern, Eastern and Central Regions.  The extent of exclusion from credit markets can be observed from a different view point. Out of 203 million households in the country, 147 million are in rural areas – 89 million are farmer households. 51.4 per cent of farm households have no access to formal or informal sources of credit while 73 per cent have no access to formal sources of credit. Similar data are not available for non farm and urban households.  2 BIS Review 71/2007 
Looking at the different sources of credit, it is observed that the share of non institutional sources reduced from 70.8% in 1971 to 42.9% in 2002. However after 1991, the share of non institutional sources has increased; specifically, the share of moneylenders in the debt of rural households increased from 17.5 % in 1991 to 29.6% in 2002. In urban areas the share of non institutional sources has come down significantly from 40% in 1981 to around 25 % in 2002.  Who are the excluded? The financially excluded sections largely comprise marginal farmers, landless labourers, oral lessees, self employed and unorganised sector enterprises, urban slum dwellers, migrants, ethnic minorities and socially excluded groups, senior citizens and women. While there are pockets of large excluded population in all parts of the country, the North East, Eastern and Central regions contain most of the financially excluded population.  Reasons for financial exclusion There are a variety of reasons for FI. In remote, hilly and sparsely populated areas with poor infrastructure, physical access itself acts as a deterrent. From the demand side, lack of awareness, low incomes/assets, social exclusion, illiteracy act as barriers. From the supply side, distance from branch, branch timings, cumbersome documentation and procedures, unsuitable products, language, staff attitudes are common reasons for exclusion. All these result in higher transaction cost apart from procedural hassles. On the other hand, the ease of availability of informal credit sources makes these popular even if costlier. The requirements of independent documentary proof of identity and address can be a very important barrier in having a bank account especially for migrants and slum dwellers.  Recent initiatives by Reserve Bank of India The period 1969 to 1991 saw a huge increase in the branch outreach in India as the average population covered by a bank branch fell from 64,000 to 13,711. In 1991 along with reforms for liberalising and opening the economy, financial sector reform aimed at deregulation, increased competition and strengthening the banking sector through recapitalisation and adoption of prudential measures. The Indian banking industry today is quite robust and strong to be able to take on the challenges of achieving greater financial inclusion.  In the Annual Policy of the Reserve Bank for 2004-05, the Governor, Dr. Reddy observed and I quote – “There has been expansion, greater competition and diversification of ownership of banks leading to both enhanced efficiency and systemic resilience in the banking sector. However, there are legitimate concerns in regard to the banking practices that tend to exclude rather than attract vast sections of population, in particular pensioners, self-employed and those employed in unorganised sector. While commercial considerations are no doubt important, the banks have been bestowed with several privileges, especially of seeking public deposits on a highly leveraged basis, and consequently they should be obliged to provide banking services to all segments of the population, on equitable basis.” Pursuant to this, the Reserve Bank has undertaken a number of measures with the objective of attracting the financially excluded population into the structured financial system. In November 2005, banks were advised to make available a basic banking “no-frills” account with low or nil minimum balances as well as charges to expand the outreach of such accounts to vast sections of the population. Banks are required to make available all printed material used by retail customers in the concerned regional language. In order to ensure that persons belonging to low income group, both in urban and rural areas do not encounter difficulties in opening bank accounts, the know your customer (KYC) procedures for opening accounts has been simplified for those persons with balances not exceeding Rs 50000/- (about GBP 600) and credits in the accounts not exceeding Rs.100000/- (about GBP 1200) in a year. The simplified procedure allows introduction by a customer on whom full KYC drill has been followed.  Banks have been asked to consider introduction of a General purpose Credit Card (GCC) facility up to Rs. 25000/- at their rural and semi urban braches. The credit facility is in the nature of revolving credit entitling the holder to withdraw upto the limit sanctioned. Based on assessment of household cash BIS Review 71/2007 3 
flows, the limits are sanctioned without insistence on security or purpose. Interest rate on the facility is completely deregulated.  A simplified mechanism for one-time settlement of overdue loans up to Rs.25,000/- has been suggested for adoption. Banks have been specifically advised that borrowers with loans settled under the one time settlement scheme will be eligible to re-access the formal financial system for fresh credit.  In January 2006, banks were permitted to utilise the services of non-governmental organisations (NGOs/SHGs), micro-finance institutions and other civil society organisations as intermediaries in providing financial and banking services through the use of business facilitator and business correspondent (BC) models. The BC model allows banks to do “cash in – cash out” transactions at the location of the BC and allows branchless banking.  Other measures include setting up pilots for credit counselling and financial education. A multilingual website in 13 Indian languages on all matters concerning banking and the common person has been launched by the Reserve Bank on 18 June 2007. Strategies and approach At the regional level, a forum called the State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC) has been in operation since nationalisation. SLBC is a group of bankers and government officials and is convened by a bank having major presence in the State called the SLBC convenor bank. It meets quarterly and reviews the banking developments in the State. At the district level, the district level committee functions; it is headed by the District Commissioner and is convened by a designated lead bank for the district. In early 2006, one district in each State was identified by the SLBC for 100 per cent financial inclusion. So far, SLBCs have reported having achieved 100 per cent financial inclusion in the Union Territory of Puducherry and in some districts in Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Punjab. Reserve Bank proposes to undertake an evaluation of the progress made in these districts by an independent external agency to draw lessons for further action in this regard. In the districts taken up for 100% financial inclusion, surveys were conducted using various data base such as electoral rolls, public distribution system, or other household data, to identify households without bank account and responsibility given to the banks in the area for ensuring that all those who wanted to have a bank account were provided with one by allocating the villages to the different banks. Mass media was deployed for creating awareness and publicity. The banks used different approaches to communicate the advantages of having a bank account. Bank staff or their agents who are usually local NGOs or village volunteers would contact the people at their households. Ration card / Electoral ID cards of the families were taken for fulfilling the simplified KYC norms. Photographs of all the persons who opened bank accounts were taken on the spot by a photographer accompanying the bank team. In most States, the product used for launching the program for financial inclusion is the “No frills” accounts. In one State the farmer’s credit card or KCC is being used ensuring first to credit rather than savings. In other States no frills account was followed by small overdraft facility or a general purpose revolving credit upto pre-specified limit. Recognizing the need for providing social security to vulnerable groups, in some cases in association with insurance companies, banks have provided innovative insurance policies at affordable cost covering life, disability and health cover.  Cooperative banks and regional rural banks being local level institutions are well suited for achieving financial inclusion. These banks are being revived and strengthened with incentives for better governance. Being local institutions they are ideally suited for achieving FI.  The role of an efficient payments system for FI cannot be overstressed and we efforts are being made to bring about Improvements in the payments system especially in the relatively less developed parts of the country. 4 BIS Review 71/2007 
Huge increase in no frills accounts    The outcome of the efforts made is reflected in the increase of 6 million new “no frills” bank accounts opened between March 2006 and 2007. In view of their vast branch network (45000 rural and semi urban branches) public sector banks and the regional rural banks have been able to scale up their efforts by merely leveraging on the existing capacity. FI is being viewed by these banks as a huge business opportunity in an overall environment that facilitates enterprise and growth. It provides them a competitive advantage and defines a clear niche for their growth.  Use of intermediaries One of the ways in which access to formal banking services has been provided very successfully since the early 90s is through the linkage of Self Help Groups (SHGs) with banks. SHGs are groups of usually women who get together and pool their savings and give loans to members. Usually there is a NGO that promotes and nurture these groups. National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development has played a very significant role in supporting group formation, linking them with banks as also promoting best practices. The SHG is given loan against guarantee of group members. The recovery experience has been very good and there are currently 2.6 million SHGs linked to banks touching nearly 40 million households through its members. Banks provide credit to such groups at reasonable rates of interest. However the size of loans is quite small and used mostly for consumption smoothening or very small businesses. In some SHGs, credit is provided for agricultural activities and other livelihoods and could be several times the deposits made by the SHG. Most of the SHGs have been linked to public sector banks in view of the latter’s dominant presence in the rural areas.  The foreign banks and private sector banks have approached the access issue through either setting up relatively lower cost non bank companies for providing small value retail loans or have partnered with micro finance institutions that provide financial services to the relatively higher risk segments of the population. Microfinance has drawn attention to an entire sector of borrowers who had been previously poorly served by the formal financial sector – and MF has demonstrated how to make lending to this sector a viable proposition. However the rates of interest charged are quite high, typically 24 to 30 per cent, mainly on account of the high transaction cost for the average loan size that can be quite small. Compared to the informal sector, perhaps the rates are lower, but issues are raised whether these rates are affordable – in the sense whether they would leave any surplus in the hands of the borrowers and lead to higher levels of living.  For commercial banks, the lower cost of funding, advantages of size and scale gives scope for cross subsidization and their interest rates are more competitive compared to the MFIs, but they have not been as successful in dealing with the last mile issue. The partnering with SHGs and MFIs with reasonable cost of funding by the banks has been seen as a more optimal approach till now.  BIS Review 71/2007 5 
As indicated earlier, a recent important regulatory measure is the permission given to banks to use post offices, cooperative societies, non government organisations set up as trusts or societies, as business correspondents (agents) for doing branchless banking after conducting due diligence on such intermediaries. Agency risk is sought to be minimised by using well respected local organisations and use of IT solutions for tracking transactions in the bank accounts. Many banks are exploring the use of this model to increase their outreach and deliver doorstep banking services at lower cost. The viability and scalability of the model would require some flexibility in charging of interest rates or services charges to cover costs.  IT solutions for financial inclusion The use of IT solutions for providing banking facilities at doorstep holds the potential for scalability of the FI initiatives. Pilot projects have been initiated using smart cards for opening bank accounts with bio metric identification. Link to mobile or hand held connectivity devices ensure that the transactions are recorded in the bank’s books on real time basis. Some State Governments are routing social security payments as also payments under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme through such smart cards (see pictures below). The same delivery channel can be used to provide other financial services like low cost remittances and insurance. The use of IT also enables banks to handle the enormous increase in the volume of transactions for millions of households for processing, credit scoring, credit record and follow up.

Biometric validation of smart card    Transaction confirmation receipt    Role of Government State Governments can play a pro-active role in facilitating FI. Issuing official identity documents for opening accounts , creating awareness and involving district and block level functionaries in the entire process, meeting cost of cards and other devices for pilots, undertaking financial literacy drives are some of the ways in which the State and district administration have involved themselves.  India Post is also looking to diversify its activities and leverage on its huge network of post offices, the postman’s intimate knowledge of the local population and the enormous trust reposed in him. Banks are entering into agreements with India Post for using post offices as agents for branchless banking. BIS Review 71/2007 7 
Work in progress The Finance Minister in his budget for 2007-08 has announced the setting up of two funds for FI; the first called Financial Inclusion Fund for developmental and promotional interventions and the other called Financial Inclusion Technology Fund to meet cost of technology adoption of about $ 125 million each. The scope of these funds is being worked out. Setting up of financial literacy centres and credit counseling on a pilot basis, launching a national financial literacy campaign, forging linkages with informal sources with suitable safeguards through appropriate legislation, evolving industry wide standards for IT solutions, facilitating low cost remittance products are some of the initiatives currently under way for furthering FI.  Thank you.  8 BIS Review 71/2007 
Mervyn King: Monetary policy developments Speech by Mr Mervyn King, Governor of the Bank of England, at the Lord Mayor’s Banquet for Bankers and Merchants of the City of London, London, 20 June 2007. *      *      * My Lord Mayor, Mr Chancellor, My Lords, Ministers, Aldermen, Mr Recorder, Sheriffs, Ladies and Gentlemen: Chancellor, this will be your last Mansion House Dinner with the Merchants and Bankers. And I want to start by warmly congratulating you on your record-breaking period in office, and on the imminent assumption of the leadership of your party and country. It has been a remarkable decade for the British economy. Your decision to grant independence to the Bank of England ten years ago is widely and rightly regarded as a fundamental improvement to the conduct of economic policy in this country, and we in the Bank are grateful to you for giving us the opportunity to demonstrate the benefits of an independent central bank. Your reform illustrates the key principle that institutions matter. Individuals, however talented, cannot consistently perform well if the institutional structure in which they operate is badly designed. For too long the UK economy lurched between success and failure rather in the way that the national cricket team has recently. Getting the institutions right was a crucial part of the 1997 reforms. Perhaps there is a lesson here for the ECB – the England and Wales Cricket Board. And I welcome the changes that you announced last week to make appointments to the Monetary Policy Committee subject to a more transparent process with a more systematic timetable. Behind the design of our monetary institutions is a simple principle. I described it last October in a lecture at Kirkcaldy. It is that the value of paper money depends on trust. Trust that it will hold its value. Trust that others will accept it as a means of payment. In particular, our banknotes must be trusted by the public – cash still accounts for over 60% of the number of transactions. In March the Bank launched a new series of bank notes with enhanced security features. As an economist, I was pleased that a pioneer of the dismal science should appear on our bank notes. Adam Smith, who appears on new £20 notes, was a thinker who recognised the importance of institutions. Imagine my concern, therefore, when, after 3 ½ years as Governor, I read the following report from the Wolverhampton Crown Court. “A judge demanded to know why police failed for three and a half years to arrest a wanted Birmingham man – when all the time he was living at home. Adam Smith, suspected of passing forged £20 notes, had a fixed address in Edgbaston and was picking up benefits”. So I hope the introduction of one Adam Smith will hinder the activities of the other. I am proud of the new £20 notes, but I cannot say the same of our £5 notes. There has been much, and in my view justified, criticism of their availability and condition. Over the past ten years, the value of Bank of England notes in circulation has doubled, from around £20 billion to around £40 billion. But none of that is accounted for by the £5 note for which the value in circulation has remained constant for fifteen years at some £1 billion. And the average lifetime of the note has doubled. As a result, many more notes are noticeably soiled and scruffy. ATMs account for over 60% of all cash obtained by the public. Few issue £5 notes. It is more economical for banks to stock ATMs with £10 and £20 notes. The problem is not at the production end – we have an ample supply of new £5 notes waiting to be used. We want to see them in circulation. There is a need for an adequate supply of low denomination notes that can be used for small transactions where cash is the predominant means of payment. Such mutual convenience is a public good, and may not correspond to the private interest of commercial banks. That is why we must not let this situation continue any longer. The public need £5 notes. The solution may involve some alteration in the incentives for banks to obtain different denomination notes from the Bank of England, new arrangements to increase the availability of notes to retailers, and an improvement in the durability of the notes that we print. So the Bank will be initiating discussions to see what methods might ensure greater access by the public to new £5 notes. BIS Review 69/2007 1 
Your reforms, Chancellor, encompassed not just monetary policy – through the Bank of England Act – but also financial regulation – through the creation of the FSA and the 1997 Memorandum of Understanding between the Bank, FSA and Treasury. There was, however, some unfinished business in that Memorandum. The Bank of England was given responsibility for the oversight of payment systems. But it was given no formal powers to discharge that responsibility. Instead it relies heavily on the influence afforded by its operational role at the centre of the high-value payment system. But that influence extends only so far. The time has come to deal with the imbalance between responsibilities and powers. The “plumbing” of the financial system represented by payment and settlement systems may not be as glamorous as the trading activity which attracts so many bright young people to work in the financial sector, but it is absolutely crucial to maintaining stability. To have responsibility without power is the misfortune of the bureaucrat. The solution, in my view, does not mean more powers for the Bank, but narrower responsibilities. Proposals are under active discussion among the tripartite partners, and they give me confidence that the imbalance will soon be resolved. Financial stability more generally is a topical concern in financial markets. More than one banker and merchant in the City has said to me recently, “I cannot recall a time when credit was more easily available”. How worried should we be? Let me begin with the implications for the stability of markets and institutions before turning to monetary policy. Securitisation is transforming banking from the traditional model in which banks originate and retain credit risk on their balance sheets into a new model in which credit risk is distributed around a much wider range of investors. As a result, risks are no longer so concentrated in a small number of regulated institutions but are spread across the financial system. That is a positive development because it has reduced the market failure associated with traditional banking – the mismatch between illiquid assets and liquid liabilities – that led Henry Thornton and, later, Walter Bagehot to promote the role of the Bank of England as the “lender of last resort” in a financial crisis. But the historical model is only a partial description of banking today. New and ever more complex financial instruments create different risks. Exotic instruments are now issued for which the distribution of returns is considerably more complicated than that on the basic loans underlying them. A standard collateralised debt obligation divides the risk and return of a portfolio of bonds, or credit default swaps, into tranches. But what is known as a CDO-squared instrument invests in tranches of CDOs. It has a distribution of returns which is highly sensitive to small changes in the correlations of underlying returns which we do not understand with any great precision. The risk of the entire return being wiped out can be much greater than on simpler instruments. Higher returns come at the expense of higher risk. Whether in banking, reinsurance or portfolio management, risk assessment is a matter of judgement as much as quantitative analysis. Ever more complex instruments are designed almost every day. Some of the important risks that could affect all instruments – from terrorist attacks, invasion of computer systems, or even the consequences of a flu pandemic – are almost impossible to quantify, and past experience offers little guide. Be cautious about how much you borrow is not a bad maxim for each and every one of us here tonight. Ignore the unsolicited emails that rain down on us offering unwanted credit. I received one last week that began, “We have the solution, Mervyn, for your bankruptcy”. The development of complex financial instruments and the spate of loan arrangements without traditional covenants suggest another maxim: be cautious about how much you lend, especially when you know rather little about the activities of the borrower. It may say champagne – AAA – on the label of an increasing number of structured credit instruments. But by the time investors get to what’s left in the bottle, it could taste rather flat. Assessing the effective degree of leverage in an ever-changing financial system is far from straightforward, and the liquidity of the markets in complex instruments, especially in conditions when many players would be trying to reduce the leverage of their portfolios at the same time, is unpredictable. Excessive leverage is the common theme of many financial crises of the past. Are we really so much cleverer than the financiers of the past? Concerns about the rate at which credit is being created extend to monetary policy. As I said last week in Cardiff, it would be optimistic in the extreme to suppose that the rapid growth of money and credit could be dismissed solely as a positive shock to the demand for money. The spread between interest rates paid by households and businesses and interest rates available in the money market has fallen. This has been one of the factors behind the strength of demand in the UK economy over the past 2 BIS Review 69/2007 
year. Despite greater availability of labour, businesses have not expanded employment sufficiently to prevent stronger demand from increasing capacity pressures. Such pressures encourage businesses to raise prices. And that is exactly what the business surveys suggest has been happening. That underlying upward pressure on inflation has in part been hidden by the volatility of domestic energy prices. But it is why we have raised interest rates four times and by 1 percentage point in all over the past year. Our central view remains that inflation will fall back this year as the rises in domestic gas and electricity prices last year drop out of the annual comparison, and the recent cuts in prices feed through to household bills. But it is important to look through those temporary effects to the outlook further ahead. The discussion within the Monetary Policy Committee is explained in the minutes of our June meeting which were published this morning. As ever, there is room for differences of judgement as to the appropriate level of Bank Rate – as shown by the differing views within the MPC. But every member of the Committee is determined to bring inflation back to target and keep it there – or as close to the target as possible – indefinitely. In the long run, it is of the utmost importance that the right institutions to secure both monetary and financial stability are in place. I believe they are. Chancellor, you are now moving on. Our country continues to benefit from the institutional arrangements you introduced in 1997. As that great political commentator Niccolo Machiavelli noted, “nothing brings a man greater honour than the new laws and new institutions he establishes”. I encourage you to be equally bold in your next job. Institutions outlast us all. Over time, they are adapted as we learn the lessons of the past in the light of a changing present to meet our future needs. Lord Mayor, you know the importance of learning, and the Chancellor has emphasised again this evening the role of education in shaping Britain’s place in the world economy. Both the Chancellor and I have been enthusiastic about the theme of your mayoralty: “City of London – City of Learning”. And all of us here tonight would like to pay tribute to your work since you became Lord Mayor, and to thank both the Lady Mayoress and yourself for the splendid hospitality which you have extended to us all this evening. So I invite you all to rise and join me in the traditional toast of good health and prosperity to "The Lord Mayor and the Lady Mayoress". BIS Review 69/2007 3 
Lucas Papademos: ECB Financial Stability Review June 2007 Opening remarks by Mr Lucas Papademos, Vice President of the European Central Bank, at the press briefing on the occasion of the publication of the June 2007 ECB Financial Stability Review, Frankfurt am Main, 15 June 2007. *      *      * I.  Introduction My colleagues and I welcome you to today’s press conference on the occasion of the publication of the June 2007 edition of the ECB’s Financial Stability Review. The financial stability assessment contained in the Review has been prepared with the close involvement of the ESCB Banking Supervision Committee. It is based on information that was available up until 11 May 2007, the “cut-off” date for this Review.  The primary objective of the semi-annual ECB Financial Stability Review is to review the main sources of risk and vulnerability for euro area financial system stability and to provide a comprehensive assessment of the capacity of the euro area financial system to absorb adverse disturbances. In addition to the financial stability assessment, the June 2007 edition of the Review addresses several topical issues in 17 boxes and it also includes five Special Feature articles. In my introduction, I will first focus on risks and vulnerabilities we have identified in: (i) the external environment; (ii) global financial markets; (iii) the euro area corporate and household sectors; and (iv) the euro area financial institutions. I will then discuss some potential risk triggering factors and will conclude with an overall assessment of the outlook for financial stability.  2.  Overview of the main developments since December 2006 Let me start by recalling some of the key developments since our previous assessment in December 2006. Overall, the macroeconomic environment has continued to be favourable. Global growth has remained robust and some rebalancing of activity among the main economic areas has occurred. In the euro area, economic growth has exceeded expectations, leading to upwards revisions to our own growth projections and to the Consensus GDP forecasts (as shown in the chart on the left of slide 3).  In both the banking and insurance sectors, profitability continued improving. Moreover, global financial markets have, for the most part, been characterised by unusually subdued volatility, while credit spreads have remained low.  Notwithstanding this favourable background, between late February and early March 2007, the shock-absorbing capacity of the global and euro area financial systems was again tested by the third significant burst of market volatility in the past two years. This was comfortably weathered and the stock market recovered quickly (seen on the right chart of slide 3). Improvements in the risk management practices of financial firms appear to have contributed to ensuring that higher financial market volatility did not prevent capital markets from facilitating the intermediation of capital.  The fact that the global and euro area financial systems have so far proved resilient to a series of adverse disturbances is comforting, but it does not provide any ground for complacency. The episodes of market volatility were triggered by relatively small and transitory disturbances in an environment of strong macroeconomic fundamentals and abundant financial market liquidity. Therefore, these episodes do not provide sufficient guidance on how the financial system would perform in the event of a larger shock that could trigger a more material and longer-lasting reappraisal of risks at a less favourable stage of the credit cycle. However, they have served to reaffirm concerns about pre-existing vulnerabilities and potential risks.  3.  External environment Let me now turn to the vulnerabilities we have identified in the external environment. Overall, risks stemming from global imbalances have remained broadly unchanged over the past six months. The chart on the left of slide 4 shows that persistently large US current account deficits have not fully accumulated into the net foreign asset position of the US, largely because of exchange rate and asset price changes. Valuation effects – primarily a weaker US dollar – have played some role in containing BIS Review 69/2007 1 
US external indebtedness. Nevertheless, the negative US net foreign asset position still remains very large in historical terms by comparison.  Since the previous assessment, concerns have increased about the possible implications of carry trades in the foreign exchange markets, driven by relatively low short-term interest rates in Japan and in Switzerland and very low exchange rate volatility. An indicator commonly used to highlight speculative pressures on exchange rates is the net short non-commercial positions in currency futures. As shown in the chart on the right of slide 4, this indicator reached unprecedented levels in early 2007 for the Japanese yen, suggesting that carry trading has grown significantly since the beginning of 2006.  In Box 4 of the FSR, a close look is taken at the evolution of the foreign exchange carry trades. The conclusion is that, from a financial stability perspective, large outstanding carry trade positions may be a concern if they make the targeted financial markets vulnerable to unexpected changes either in short-term interest rates in the funding currency or exchange rate volatility. A pertinent issue for the outlook for financial stability is whether there have been signs of a turn in the US credit cycle. The assessment of the markets and banks appears, on the face of it, to be somewhat divided. For example, credit spreads on sub-investment grade bonds have narrowed further, but US banks are no longer easing their credit standards on loans granted to firms. The fundamentals of US firms have overall remained strong. Although rating downgrades have outpaced upgrades in the US credit market, this deterioration of credit quality has not translated into higher default rates. It has been suggested that the existence of abundant market liquidity is one of the reasons why rating agencies have, since late 2004, consistently revised their forecasts of rising global default rates, pushing them further into the future (see the chart on the left of slide 5). In particular, due to the growing presence of new participants in credit markets with greater risk tolerances, it seems that firms with lower creditworthiness (credit ratings) may have found it easier to refinance and restructure their debt. This refinancing activity has included the greater use of weaker loan covenants than in the past. Thus, to a certain extent, firms may only be deferring their financial difficulties into the future. When the credit cycle finally turns, the consequences could be more abrupt and severe than past experience might suggest. In this context, the recent episode of re-appraisal of credit risk pricing in the US sub-prime mortgage market may provide some guidance on how the credit market could behave in a broader downturn. Since mid-2005, the combined effect of resets of initial borrowing terms to higher interest rates and reduced abilities of borrowers to avoid such resets through house sales or to carry out cash-out refinancing, has been associated with rising delinquency rates on securitised sub-prime mortgage loans. The impact of sub-prime mortgage delinquencies on the lower-quality-end of the credit risk transfer (CRT) market has been substantial. Early this year, the concern of market participants about deteriorating sub-prime credit quality led to a significant and, so far, persistent increase in the cost of credit protection associated with sub-prime non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), as shown in the chart on the right of slide 5.  Box 2 of the Review contains a more detailed assessment of the potential risks of the sub-prime episode. It concludes that there is some concern that the deteriorating performance of sub-prime RMBS could affect the broader market for structured credit instruments, due to the fact that the concentration of sub-prime mortgage loans as collateral for collateralised debt obligations (CDOs) is very high. It cannot be ruled out that further poor performance of this type of collateral could trigger rating downgrades of CDO tranches themselves and lead to a reassessment of risk in other segments of structured credit markets.  Financial market liquidity An overarching theme, pertaining to several sources of risk and vulnerability in the financial markets, is the abundant liquidity characterising global markets. Indeed, there appears to be a consensus among market participants that market liquidity has reached unprecedented levels. Financial market liquidity is a measure of the ability of market participants to undertake securities transactions without triggering large changes in their prices. The concept of financial market liquidity is distinct from the concept of monetary liquidity, but there can be links between the two. Although the measurement of market liquidity is rather complex, symptoms of the abundance of liquidity include high leverage, low yields, low market volatility, narrow credit spreads, and high market turnover. Overall, abundant liquidity seems to be intertwined with the “search for yield” which has been discussed in past issues of the FSR and it appears to be dependent on confidence remaining in the smooth functioning of the market.  2 BIS Review 69/2007 
The chart on the left of slide 6 introduces a composite indicator of financial market liquidity in the euro area equity, bond, foreign exchange and credit markets. It is constructed to gauge three different dimensions of market liquidity. The first dimension is tightness , that is the magnitude of risk premiums required by market-makers for holding inventories of securities, and it is measured by the bid-ask spread. The second dimension is depth and resiliency , that is the degree to which the volume of transactions impacts on asset prices, and it is measured by using ratios of asset price movements to transactions. The third dimension relates to liquidity risk premia, that is, the compensation required by investors for the risk that attempts to unwind positions could be challenged by uncertain market conditions in the future. This is measured using yield spreads between securities which are known to have varying degrees of liquidity.  The evolution of this indicator over time confirms that financial market liquidity has increased significantly since 2001. It rose sharply in 2003 and 2004 and markets have remained very liquid since then. The increase in market liquidity may reflect structural changes in financial markets; for example, the liberalisation of international flows of capital, the securitisation of loans, the development of new financial instruments, and the rapidly growing market presence of highly active financial market participants, such as hedge funds.  However, buoyant market liquidity could also reflect excessive risk appetite, indicating that liquidity risk could be under-priced, as well as high leverage. To the extent that high risk appetite is an important determinant of market liquidity, the current favourable liquidity conditions could suddenly, and unexpectedly, fade away, if there were a loss of confidence or an abrupt and lasting increase in risk aversion. This could expose several underlying vulnerabilities in the financial system on which I will elaborate later on.  Global financial institutions Turning to global financial institutions, with the exception of the fact that the hedge fund industry has grown further in size, all other backward-looking indicators suggest that potential risks to financial stability posed by hedge funds have not changed materially since the December 2006 FSR.  However, market risks posed by hedge funds remain. They arise largely from information which suggests that over-capacity, and indeed over-crowding, could be taking place in the sector after a simultaneous increase in the number of funds and a reduction of profitable trading opportunities over the last couple of years. On the one hand, as illustrated in the chart on the left of slide 7, average hedge fund returns have been on a downward trend since the early 1990s. This trend could point to overcapacity and to a consequent lowering of the amount of profitable investment opportunities available, although other explanations are also possible. At the same time, the degree of correlation between hedge fund returns across different strategies, shown in the chart on the right of slide 7, remained around the same relatively high level as in mid-2006. There are concerns about the implications for market dynamics if there was to be an event which would prompt many funds into “rushing towards the exit” at the same time due to the crowding of trades, i.e. that many funds are positioned similarly.  4.  Euro area financial system Euro area corporate sector Let me now focus on the euro area corporate sector. Against a background of strong economic conditions, low financing costs and abundant market liquidity, the rate of borrowing by the euro area corporate sector began to quicken after mid-2005. As a result, key indicators of the leverage of the sector had reached unprecedented heights. However, as analysed in Box 7, the recent re-leveraging in the euro area corporate sector has not been broad-based, but rather it has been concentrated among unlisted firms – including not only small and medium-sized enterprises, but also firms which have been de-listed through private equity deals. Data is obviously lacking on unlisted firms, but comparing trends in the debt-to-asset ratio for listed non-financial corporations and the debt-to-GDP ratio for the non-financial corporate sector suggests that a sharp rise has taken place in the debt-to-asset ratio of unlisted firms in the period since 2004 (see chart on the left of slide 8).  Increasing corporate sector leverage in the euro area has also begun to raise questions about the likelihood of an adverse turn in the credit cycle and its possible consequences for the financial system. BIS Review 69/2007 3 
Although closely related to business cycles, credit cycles are also driven by the criteria applied by banks and other investors when extending credit. By this yardstick, a long period of inertia in bank lending standards since mid-2004 and the persistent tightness of credit spreads suggest that euro area firms have not been facing financing constraints (as shown in the chart on the right of slide 8). On the contrary, as banks placed greater emphasis on the so-called “originate and distribute” business model, new opportunities have emerged for other financial institutions to acquire exposures to credit. This development has further improved firms’ access to bank credit.  Euro area household sector Turning to the euro area household sector, the pace of net borrowing by the household sector has slowed since spring 2006, but has remained at high levels (see the chart on the left of slide 9). There have also been signs of moderation of house price inflation in a number of euro area housing markets. The risk of potentially disruptive property price declines in the future appears limited in the euro area as a whole, although differences continue to exist among individual Member States. However, concerns remain about the sustainability of unprecedented levels of mortgage-related leverage in those parts of the euro area where, ceteris paribus, housing valuations appear stretched, where the debt build-up has been pronounced, and where the majority of debt is financed at variable interest rates.  While measures of leverage compared to income can provide a rough indication of the ability to service debt, it is also important to evaluate the sustainability vis-à-vis assets, as this can provide an indication of the capacity of households to repay their debts in full at an aggregate level. The value of household assets – which is much larger than that of their debt – has grown more than their liabilities, especially after 2002, as the stock market has recovered the losses from the bursting of the high-tech bubble and as house prices have also risen. As a result, as shown in the chart on the right of slide 9, households have seen a notable rise in their net wealth over this period, driven in particular by the housing wealth component, which accounted for about 60% of total household wealth in 2006.  Euro area large and complex banking groups The financial soundness of large and complex banking groups (LCBGs) in the euro area strengthened further in the second half of 2006, consolidating on the steady and broad-based improvement from 2003 onwards. Profitability continued to rise, underpinned by favourable macroeconomic conditions and, for the most part, very low levels of financial market volatility. The chart on the left of side 10 shows that compared to the situation in 2005, the distribution of returns on equity for large and complex banking groups (LCBGs) has become more compressed around the mean with the profitability of the institutions in the lower quantiles remaining unchanged or increasing slightly. At the same time, Tier 1 capital bases comfortably exceeded the regulatory minima for solvency ratios, pointing to a reassuring shock-absorbing capacity. Risk management among LCBGs is expected to improve further as the Basel II capital rules are being implemented in the course of the current year.  Special Feature articles B and C in this edition of the FSR introduce a model for stress-testing the resilience of euro area LCBGs in the face of a wide range of adverse shocks to the global macro-financial environment. The results suggest that the corporate credit quality of LCBGs tends to deteriorate following negative shocks to GDP and oil prices as well as an appreciation of the euro against the US dollar. The worsening credit quality, in turn, can have a rather marked negative impact on banks’ solvency as measures by Tier 1 capital ratios.  In recent years, euro area LCBGs have faced challenges in increasing, or at least maintaining, interest income as a share of total income, but they have enjoyed further improvements in fee, commission and especially trading income. Indeed, the share of banks’ trading income in net operating income rose significantly in 2006. For some LCBGs with sizeable capital market operations, the share of trading income accounted for nearly half of net operating income in 2006 and corresponded to more than 45% of their Tier 1 capital, as shown in the chart on the right of slide 10.  Special Feature article A looks at the relationship between bank income diversity and systemic risk. It finds that a measure of systemic risk is positively correlated with bank size and the share of trading income, while it is negatively correlated with revenues from (traditional) interest income sources.  4 BIS Review 69/2007 
Euro area insurance sector In the euro area insurance sector, there was a broad-based improvement in profitability in 2006 (see the chart on the left of slide 11). The positive assessment is further supported by the fact that the profitability of the weaker performers in 2005 also improved in 2006. Underlying this improvement was a strengthening of investment income, mainly owing to buoyant stock markets and higher interest rates. Moreover, favourable developments in the financial conditions of primary insurers and reinsurers in 2006, together with a greater focus on risk management and risk-adjusted prices, support a positive outlook for the euro area insurance sector as a whole. These positive developments continued to be priced into expected default frequencies (as shown in the chart on the right of slide 11). However, risks and challenges for the sector remain, as greater financial market risks could pose a challenge to the life insurance and non-life insurance sectors. 5.  Triggering factors for the materialisation of risks and the exposure of vulnerabilities I will now consider some possible factors that could trigger the materialisation of certain risks and the exposure of identified vulnerabilities. An important issue highlighted in the FSR relates to the existing ample financial market liquidity and the prevailing very low risk premia. One possibility is that an abrupt and sharp increase in risk aversion and a loss of confidence could lead to a substantial reduction in financial market liquidity which, as stressed, is currently abundant. Such a decline could expose several underlying vulnerabilities and trigger an adverse scenario which could involve:  • Funding liquidity challenges for highly leveraged financial institutions; • Unwinding of carry trades and possible unwinding of global imbalances;  • Increasing credit spreads across the credit quality spectrum;  • Increased asset price volatility in financial markets more generally; and  • Reduced bank profitability as a result of lower trading revenues.  A second adverse scenario could be triggered by a turn in the credit cycle or by a large credit event. This could lead to an unravelling of vulnerabilities in the corporate and household sectors and in credit markets that could involve:  • defaults of low credit-quality, high-leveraged households and firms; • significant challenges in the structured credit and CRT markets;  • losses and potential failures of high leveraged financial institutions; and  • counterparty risks for banks. In this context, the “triangle of vulnerability”, identified in the December 2006 FSR, connecting the state of the credit cycle, credit derivatives and highly leveraged institutions, could have grown in relevance in the recent period. A shock involving any element of this triangle could have implications for the other two. For example, a sharp turn in the credit cycle could mean that credit risk protection-sellers, such as hedge funds, would have to make payments to banks which are protection-buyers, but hedge funds might not be capable of paying. Although many hedge funds have attempted to extend their investor lock-up periods, their positions are typically marked-to-market, implying that their funding remains vulnerable to any losses suffered because it could significantly impact on the willingness of banks to continue to grant credit. At the same time, a turn in the credit cycle could represent a challenging test for the functioning of the credit derivatives markets. Similarly, if widespread problems were to emerge in hedge funds active in credit risk transfer markets, this could spark a downturn in the credit cycle itself, as it could impair the “originate and distribute” business model upon which large banks have become reliant.  6.  Overall assessment of the financial stability outlook Let me now conclude with the overall assessment of the financial stability outlook. Comparing the current assessment with that presented in the December 2006 FSR, the main scenario for euro area financial stability remains broadly favourable:  BIS Review 69/2007 5 
• The current macroeconomic environment is benign and global and euro area economic activity it is expected to remain robust;  • In February and March 2007, the resilience of the financial system was tested by the third significant burst of market volatility in two years, which it comfortably weathered; • Euro area credit quality, overall, remains high and should be underpinned by a favourable economic outlook; • Pockets of vulnerability in the euro area household and corporate sectors have most likely increased, but, on average, financial positions remain sound; • The profitability of euro area financial institutions further improved and solvency is comfortable relative to regulatory requirements.  However, pre-existing sources of risk and vulnerability remain and some have grown:  • The recent market jitters have confirmed concerns regarding previously identified risks and vulnerabilities and have revealed the relevance of some new risk exposures;  • Vulnerabilities could be quickly unearthed if market liquidity were to abruptly and sharply decline, possibly triggered by a wane in risk appetite caused by a change in risk perceptions; • Re-leveraging in the corporate sector and the process of credit risk transfer from the banking system to other financial institutions and market participants which is associated with a greater emphasis on the “originate and distribute” business model by banks, could constitute vulnerabilities in a less benign market environment. • In addition, global imbalances remain a medium-term, low-probability but potentially high impact risk for financial stability.  Therefore, despite the strong performance of the financial sector and the benign macroeconomic outlook, there is no room for complacency, given the potential risks and the identified vulnerabilities. This conclusion also reflects the fact that the materialisation of risks and the triggers that could expose vulnerabilities can not be predicted with any degree of certainty. The main message for the financial institutions is to prepare to mitigate potential disturbances through appropriate risk management arrangements including through stress-testing and vigilant monitoring of the financial soundness of their counterparties.   6 BIS Review 69/2007

Ben S Bernanke: The financial accelerator and the credit channel Remarks by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at a conference on The Credit Channel of Monetary Policy in the Twenty-first Century, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Atlanta, 15 June 2007. *      *      * Economic growth and prosperity are created primarily by what economists call "real" factors – the productivity of the workforce, the quantity and quality of the capital stock, the availability of land and natural resources, the state of technical knowledge, and the creativity and skills of entrepreneurs and managers. But extensive practical experience as well as much formal research highlights the crucial supporting role that financial factors play in the economy. An entrepreneur with a great new idea for building a better mousetrap typically must tap financial capital, perhaps from a bank or a venture capitalist, to transform that idea into a profitable commercial enterprise. To expand and modernize their plants and increase their staffs, most firms must turn to financial markets or to financial institutions to secure this essential input. Families rely on the financial markets to obtain mortgages or to help finance their children's educations. In short, healthy financial conditions help a modern economy realize its full potential. For this reason, one of the critical priorities of developing economies is establishing a modern, well-functioning financial system. In the United States, a deep and liquid financial system has promoted growth by effectively allocating capital and has increased economic resilience by increasing our ability to share and diversify risks both domestically and globally. Just as a healthy financial system promotes growth, adverse financial conditions may prevent an economy from reaching its potential. A weak banking system grappling with nonperforming loans and insufficient capital or firms whose creditworthiness has eroded because of high leverage or declining asset values are examples of financial conditions that could undermine growth. Japan faced just this kind of challenge when the financial problems of banks and corporations contributed substantially to sub-par growth during the so-called "lost decade."  As the topic of this conference reminds us, financial conditions may affect shorter-term economic conditions as well as the longer-term health of the economy. Notably, some evidence supports the view that changes in financial and credit conditions are important in the propagation of the business cycle, a mechanism that has been dubbed the "financial accelerator." Moreover, a fairly large literature has argued that changes in financial conditions may amplify the effects of monetary policy on the economy, the so-called credit channel of monetary-policy transmission. In fact, as I will discuss, these two ideas are essentially related. As someone who (in a former life) did research on both of these topics, I thought it might be useful for me to provide a somewhat personal overview of the financial accelerator and credit channel ideas and their common underlying logic. Along the way I will offer a few thoughts on where future research might be most productive. Market frictions and the real effects of financial and credit conditions Economists have not always fully appreciated the importance of a healthy financial system for economic growth or the role of financial conditions in short-term economic dynamics. As a matter of intellectual history, the reason is not difficult to understand. During the first few decades after World War II, economic theorists emphasized the development of general equilibrium models of the economy with complete markets; that is, in their analyses, economists generally abstracted from market "frictions" such as imperfect information or transaction costs. But without such frictions, financial markets have little reason to exist. For example, with complete markets (and if we ignore taxes), we know that whether a corporation finances itself by debt or equity is irrelevant (the Modigliani-Miller theorem). The blossoming of work on asymmetric information and principal-agent theory, led by Nobel laureates Joseph Stiglitz and George Akerlof and with contributions from many other researchers, gave economists the tools to think about the central role of financial markets in the real economy. For example, the classic 1976 paper by Michael Jensen and William Meckling showed that, in a world of imperfect information and principal-agent problems, the capital structure of the firm could be used as a tool by shareholders to better align the incentives of managers with the shareholders' interests. Thus BIS Review 68/2007 1 
was born a powerful and fruitful rejoinder to the Modigliani-Miller neutrality result and, more broadly, a perspective on capital structure that has had enduring influence. My own first job as an academic was at Stanford University, where I arrived as an assistant professor in the Graduate School of Business in 1979. At the time, Stanford was a hotbed of work on asymmetric information, incentives, and the principal-agent problem; and even though my field was macroeconomics, I was heavily influenced by that intellectual environment. I became particularly interested in how this perspective on financial markets could help explain why financial crises – that is, extreme disruptions of the normal functioning of financial markets – seem often to have a significant impact on the real economy. Putting the issue in the context of U.S. economic history, I laid out, in a 1983 article, two channels by which the financial problems of the 1930s may have worsened the Great Depression (Bernanke, 1983).  The first channel worked through the banking system. As emphasized by the information-theoretic approach to finance, a central function of banks is to screen and monitor borrowers, thereby overcoming information and incentive problems. By developing expertise in gathering relevant information, as well as by maintaining ongoing relationships with customers, banks and similar intermediaries develop "informational capital." The widespread banking panics of the 1930s caused many banks to shut their doors; facing the risk of runs by depositors, even those who remained open were forced to constrain lending to keep their balance sheets as liquid as possible. Banks were thus prevented from making use of their informational capital in normal lending activities. The resulting reduction in the availability of bank credit inhibited consumer spending and capital investment, worsening the contraction. The second channel through which financial crises affected the real economy in the 1930s operated through the creditworthiness of borrowers. In general, the availability of collateral facilitates credit extension. The ability of a financially healthy borrower to post collateral reduces the lender's risks and aligns the borrower's incentives with those of the lender. However, in the 1930s, declining output and falling prices (which increased real debt burdens) led to widespread financial distress among borrowers, lessening their capacity to pledge collateral or to otherwise retain significant equity interests in their proposed investments. Borrowers' cash flows and liquidity were also impaired, which likewise increased the risks to lenders. Overall, the decline in the financial health of potential borrowers during the Depression decade further impeded the efficient allocation of credit. Incidentally, this information-based explanation of how the sharp deflation in prices in the 1930s may have had real effects was closely related to, and provided a formal rationale for, the idea of "debt-deflation", advanced by Irving Fisher in the early 1930s (Fisher, 1933). The external finance premium and the financial accelerator Both real and monetary shocks produced the Great Depression, and in my 1983 paper I argued that banking and financial markets propagated both types of impulses, without distinguishing sharply between the two. My subsequent research and that of many others looked separately at the role of financial conditions in amplifying both monetary and nonmonetary influences.  On the nonmonetary side, Mark Gertler and I showed how, in principle, the effects of a real shock (such as a shock to productivity) on financial conditions could lead to persistent fluctuations in the economy, even if the initiating shock had little or no intrinsic persistence (Bernanke and Gertler, 1989). A key concept in our analysis was the external finance premium, defined as the difference between the cost to a borrower of raising funds externally and the opportunity cost of internal funds. External finance (raising funds from lenders) is virtually always more expensive than internal finance (using internally generated cash flows), because of the costs that outside lenders bear of evaluating borrowers' prospects and monitoring their actions. Thus, the external finance premium is generally positive. Moreover, the theory predicts that the external finance premium that a borrower must pay should depend inversely on the strength of the borrower's financial position, measured in terms of factors such as net worth, liquidity, and current and future expected cash flows. Fundamentally, a financially strong borrower has more "skin in the game," so to speak, and consequently has greater incentives to make well-informed investment choices and to take the actions needed to ensure good financial outcomes. Because of the good incentives that flow from the borrower's having a significant stake in the enterprise and the associated reduction in the need for intensive evaluation and 2 BIS Review 68/2007 
monitoring by the lender, borrowers in good financial condition generally pay a lower premium for external finance.1  The inverse relationship of the external finance premium and the financial condition of borrowers creates a channel through which otherwise short-lived economic shocks may have long-lasting effects. In the hypothetical case that Gertler and I analyzed, an increase in productivity that improves the cash flows and balance sheet positions of firms leads in turn to lower external finance premiums in subsequent periods, which extends the expansion as firms are induced to continue investing even after the initial productivity shock has dissipated. This "financial accelerator" effect applies in principle to any shock that affects borrower balance sheets or cash flows. The concept is useful in that it can help to explain the persistence and amplitude of cyclical fluctuations in a modern economy. Although the financial accelerator seems intuitive – certainly financial and credit conditions tend to be procyclical – nailing down this mechanism empirically has not proven entirely straightforward. For example, empirical studies of business investment in structures, equipment, and inventories have often found that a firm's cash flow significantly determines its level of investment and that the link between cash flow and investment tends to be stronger for firms (such as relatively small firms) that have more limited access to capital markets.2 In a "frictionless" capital market in which borrowers do not face an external finance premium, a firm's cash position would be irrelevant to its decision to invest because efficient capital markets would supply any necessary funding for investment projects expected to yield a positive net return. Thus, findings of a positive association between cash flow and investment tends to support the financial accelerator theory.  These findings also raise issues and questions, however. I will mention two. First, as a number of researchers have pointed out, the apparent empirical link between cash flow and investment may arise because cash flow proxies for difficult-to-measure factors like the prospective return on investment, which would be relevant to the investment decision even without capital-market frictions. This identification problem is a difficult one. However, some work that has attempted to correct for this possible misspecification has still found a role for cash flow (see, for example, Gilchrist and Himmelberg, 1999). Second, if only the smallest firms have significant external finance premiums, as implied by some research, then the macroeconomic significance of the financial accelerator may be questioned. One response to this point, pursued by several researchers, has been to dispute the claim that small firms do not play a significant role in business-cycle fluctuations. For example, small firms apparently account for a significant portion of cyclical changes in employment and inventory stocks. Another response has been to argue that even large firms with relatively good access to capital markets may face nontrivial external finance premiums. For instance, using a sample that included large public companies, researchers at the Board have estimated external finance premiums of economically significant magnitudes, and they showed that these premiums rose sharply during the 2001 recession, as predicted by the financial accelerator theory (Levin, Natalucci, and Zakrajsek, 2004; Levin and Natalucci, 2005).  Financial accelerator effects need not be confined to firms and capital spending but may operate through household spending decisions as well.3 Household borrowers, like firms, presumably face an external finance premium, which is lower the stronger their financial position. For households, home equity is often a significant part of net worth. Certainly, households with low mortgage loan-to-value ratios can borrow on relatively favorable terms through home-equity lines of credit, with the equity in their home effectively serving as collateral. If the financial accelerator hypothesis is correct, changes in home values may affect household borrowing and spending by somewhat more than suggested by the conventional wealth effect because changes in homeowners' net worth also affect their external finance premiums and thus their costs of credit. If true, this hypothesis has various interesting implications. For example, unlike the standard view based on the wealth effect, this approach would suggest that the distribution of housing wealth across the population matters because the effect on aggregate consumption of a given decline in house prices is greater, the greater the fraction of                                                       1  Over the past two decades, an extensive theoretical literature has exploited the idea that borrowers' financial positions affect their external finance premiums and thus their overall cost of credit. See, for example, Bernanke and Gertler (1989), Kiyotaki and Moore (1997), Bernanke, Gertler, and Gilchrist (1999), Carlstrom and Fuerst (2001), Aoki, Proudman and Vlieghe (2004), and Iacoviello (2005). 2  Calomiris, Himmelberg and Wachtel,(1995), Carpenter, Fazzari and Petersen (1998), and Gilchrist and Himmelberg (1999). 3  See Aoki, Proudman and Vlieghe (2002, 2004), Iacoviello (2005), and Almeida, Campello and Liu (2006). BIS Review 68/2007 3 
consumers who begin with relatively low home equity. Another possible implication is that the structure of mortgage contracts may matter for consumption behavior. In countries like the United Kingdom, for example, where most mortgages have adjustable rates, changes in short-term interest rates (whether induced by monetary policy or some other factor) have an almost immediate effect on household cash flows. If household cash flows affect access to credit, then consumer spending may react relatively quickly. In an economy where most mortgages carry fixed rates, such as the United States, that channel of effect may be more muted. I do not think we know at this point whether, in the case of households, these effects are quantitatively significant in the aggregate. Certainly, these issues seem worthy of further study.  Monetary policy and the credit channel The ideas I have been discussing today have also been useful in understanding the nature of the monetary policy transmission process. Some evidence suggests that the influence of monetary policy on real variables is greater than can be explained by the traditional "cost-of-capital" channel, which holds that monetary policy affects borrowing, investment, and spending decisions solely through its effect on the level of market interest rates. This finding has led researchers to look for supplementary channels through which monetary policy may affect the economy. One such supplementary channel, the so-called credit channel, holds that monetary policy has additional effects because interest-rate decisions affect the cost and availability of credit by more than would be implied by the associated movement in risk-free interest rates, such as Treasury rates. The credit channel, in turn, has traditionally been broken down into two components or channels of policy influence: the balance-sheet channel and the bank-lending channel (Bernanke and Gertler, 1995). The balance-sheet channel of monetary policy is closely related to the idea of the financial accelerator that I have already discussed. That theory builds from the premise that changes in interest rates engineered by the central bank affect the values of the assets and the cash flows of potential borrowers and thus their creditworthiness, which in turn affects the external finance premium that borrowers face. For example, according to this view, a tightening of monetary policy that reduces the net worth and liquidity of borrowers would increase the effective cost of credit by more than the change in risk-free rates and thus would intensify the effect of the policy action. In the interest of time I will confine the remainder of my remarks to the bank-lending channel. The theory of the bank-lending channel holds that monetary policy works in part by affecting the supply of loans offered by depository institutions. This concept is a cousin of the idea I proposed in my paper on the Great Depression, that the failures of banks during the 1930s destroyed "information capital" and thus reduced the effective supply of credit to borrowers. Alan Blinder and I adapted this general idea to show how, by affecting banks' loanable funds, monetary policy could influence the supply of intermediated credit (Bernanke and Blinder, 1988). Historically, monetary policy did appear to affect the supply of bank loans (at any given level of interest rates). In the 1960s and 1970s, when reserve requirements were higher and more comprehensive than they are today, Federal Reserve open market operations that drained reserves from the banking system tended to force a contraction in deposits. Regulation Q, which capped interest rates payable on deposits, prevented banks from offsetting the decline in deposits by offering higher interest rates. Moreover, banks had limited alternatives to deposits as a funding source. Thus, monetary tightening typically resulted in a shrinking of banks' balance sheets and a diversion of funds away from the banking system, a phenomenon known as disintermediation. The extension of credit to bank-dependent borrowers, which included many firms as well as households, was consequently reduced, with implications for spending and economic activity. Of course, much has changed in U.S. banking and financial markets since the 1960s and 1970s. Reserve requirements are lower and apply to a smaller share of deposits than in the past. Regulation Q is gone. And the capital markets have become deep, liquid, and easily accessible, either directly or indirectly, to almost all depository institutions. Although the traditional bank-lending channel may still be operative in economies that remain relatively more bank-dependent, as recent research has found for some European countries (Ehrmann and others, 2003), in the United States today it seems unlikely to be quantitatively important. This is not to say, however, that financial intermediation no longer matters for monetary policy and the transmission of economic shocks. For example, although banks and other intermediaries no longer depend exclusively on insured deposits for funding, nondeposit sources of funding are likely to be relatively more expensive than deposits, reflecting the credit risks associated with uninsured lending 4 BIS Review 68/2007 
(Stein, 1998). Moreover, the cost and availability of nondeposit funds for any given bank will depend on the perceived creditworthiness of the institution. Thus, the concerns of holders of uninsured bank liabilities about bank credit quality generate an external finance premium for banks that is similar to that faced by other borrowers. The external finance premium paid by banks is presumably reflected in turn in the cost and availability of funds to bank-dependent borrowers. Importantly, this way of casting the bank-lending channel unifies the financial accelerator and credit channel concepts, as the central mechanism of both is seen to be the external finance premium and its relationship to borrowers' balance sheets. The only difference is that the financial accelerator focuses on the ultimate borrowers – firms and households – whereas financial intermediaries are the relevant borrowers in the theory of the credit channel. By the way, the existence of loan sales and the originate-to-distribute model of bank lending does not fundamentally change this picture. Loan sales and similar activities are, in essence, another form of nondeposit financing, and the effective cost of this form of funding to the bank will generally depend on its perceived financial strength and resources (which may affect recourse and reinsurance arrangements with the loan purchasers, for example). Recently, researchers have pursued a number of approaches in search of evidence of a distinct banking channel. For example, some researchers have focused on smaller banks, which may have fewer funding alternatives to deposits and whose customer base may consist disproportionately of bank-dependent borrowers (Kashyap and Stein, 2000). Of course, these days, even the smallest of banks has ready access to sources of funds other than retail deposits. Thus, even for the smallest banks, the source of any bank-lending channel remains the existence of a finance premium on marginal sources of (uninsured) nondeposit funding, rather than an absolute constraint on the quantity of available funding. Moreover, for the bank channel to affect economic activity, borrowers accustomed to relying on banks must be unable to turn to other lenders, at least not without some cost. For some business borrowers, particularly small business borrowers that rely on banking relationships, this scenario is plausible.4 But financial innovation and deregulation imply that borrowers in the market for a mortgage or consumer credit have numerous nonbank financing alternatives, blunting any direct impact of changes in bank lending. I will return to nonbank lending and its implications in a moment. If relationship borrowing is the key, then – as pointed out in the paper at this conference by Black, Hancock, and Passmore – a bank with many such borrowers might defensively invest in deposit capacity, say, by increasing the number of branches. By actively seeking to finance a high share of loans with insured deposits, such a bank could shield its borrowers from the effects of increases in the nondeposit finance premium, whether the result of monetary policy or some other factor. Consistent with this idea, these authors find that banks that make a large share of their loans to small businesses also tend to have a high ratio of deposits to loans. The recognition that, fundamentally, the bank-lending channel is based on changes in the quality of bank balance sheets naturally turns our attention to bank capital and its determinants (Van den Heuvel, 2002). Raising new capital on the open market can be difficult and costly for many banks, implying that, in the short run, capital is determined by earnings and changes in asset values. Changes in the value of capital, particularly when a bank's capital is not much higher than the level demanded by regulators or the market, potentially affects the bank's cost of funds. In conformity with this hypothesis, various studies have found evidence that loans provided by banks that are more capital-constrained seem more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than loans provided by highly capitalized banks.5 Moreover, changes in the financial condition of banks may play a role in cyclical developments. I have already mentioned the cases of Japan's "lost decade." Closer to home, some believe that the U.S. economy's recovery from the 1990-91 recession was delayed by "financial headwinds," which arose from regional shortages of bank capital (Bernanke and Lown, 1991).  One might view the idea that banks are somehow "special" in their ability to gather information and to screen and monitor borrowers as rather dated. Banks do continue to play a central role in credit markets; in particular, because of the burgeoning market for loan sales, banks originate considerably more loans than they keep on their books. Nevertheless, nonbank lenders have become increasingly important in many credit markets, and relatively few borrowers are restricted to banks as sources of                                                       4  In recent years, community banks appear to have become increasingly important in lending to small businesses (Avery and Samolyk, 2004). 5  Kishan and Opiela, (2000), Kishan and Opiela, (2006), and Gambacorta (2005).

credit. Of course, nonbank lenders do not have access to insured deposits. However, they can fund loans by borrowing on capital markets or by selling loans to securitizers. Does the rise of nonbank lenders make the bank-lending channel irrelevant? I am not so sure that it does. Like banks, nonbank lenders have to raise funds in order to lend, and the cost at which they raise those funds will depend on their financial condition – their net worth, their leverage, and their liquidity, for example. Thus, nonbank lenders also face an external finance premium that presumably can be influenced by economic developments or monetary policy. The level of the premium they pay will in turn affect the rates that they can offer borrowers. Thus, the ideas underlying the bank-lending channel might reasonably extend to all private providers of credit. Further investigation of this possibility would be quite worthwhile. Conclusion I have taken you on a whirlwind tour of several decades of research on how variations in the financial condition of borrowers, whether arising from changes in monetary policy or from other forces, can affect short-term economic dynamics. The critical idea is that the cost of funds to borrowers depends inversely on their creditworthiness, as measured by indicators such as net worth and liquidity. Endogenous changes in creditworthiness may increase the persistence and amplitude of business cycles (the financial accelerator) and strengthen the influence of monetary policy (the credit channel). As I have noted today, what has been called the bank-lending channel – the idea that banks play a special role in the transmission of monetary policy – can be integrated into this same broad logical framework, if we focus on the link between the bank's financial condition and its cost of capital. Nonbank lenders may well be subject to the same forces.  Let me conclude by offering you best wishes for a stimulating and enjoyable last day of the conference. Policymakers and scholars both will benefit from your efforts. References Almeida, Heitor, Murillo Campello, and Crocker H. Liu (2006).

BIS Review 68/2007 1 Vittorio Corbo: Monetary policy in emerging countries – the view from Chile Speech by Mr Vittorio Corbo, Governor of the Central Bank of Chile, at the Bank of Italy, Rome, 18 June 2007.  Prepared for presentation at Banca d’Italia. I thank Marcelo Ochoa and Ivonne Vera for assistance and Klaus Schmidt-Hebbel and Andrea Tokman for suggestions and comments. *      *      * Emerging economies have recorded major progress in the conduct and results of monetary policy during the last two decades. This achievement is due to implementation of more robust and transparent monetary regimes, complemented by adoption of flexible exchange rates, sustainable fiscal policies, and stronger financial systems. Among emerging economies, Chile’s experience is of particular interest. It shows that monetary stability can be attained as a result of coherent policies, overcoming decades of macroeconomic instability and weak credibility. This presentation documents the improvement of monetary policy conduct and results in emerging economies in general and Chile in particular. Section 1 summarizes the overall trend and specific components of macroeconomic adjustment observed in emerging economies. Chile’s transition toward its current monetary policy framework, based on full-fledged inflation targeting, is described next. Section 3 analyzes and documents the results of improved monetary policy in emerging economies and in Chile during the last two decades. Brief conclusions close the presentation. 1.  Macroeconomic adjustment in emerging economies Macroeconomic management in emerging markets has improved substantially in the last decade. In particular, the very favorable world economic conditions that have resulted in important terms of trade gains have been associated this time to fiscal prudence, complementing monetary and exchange-rate policies aimed at achieving and maintaining price stability. Four areas of macroeconomic adjustment: Fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policies, and the financial system The main changes that have taken place are in four key areas: (i) adoption of sustainable and responsible fiscal policies, reflected in declining fiscal deficits in most emerging economies (figure 1); (ii) adoption of floating regimes or hard pegs, moving away from intermediate exchange-rate (ER) regimes; (iii) shift of monetary policy (MP) anchors from ERs or monetary aggregates to an inflation-targeting (IT) anchor, particularly in Latin America; and (iv) these changes have been accompanied by the strengthening of regulation and supervision of financial systems, supporting strong financial development. Shift toward more flexible ER regimes The world shift toward more flexible ER regimes has been pronounced. The evidence shows a significant shift away from intermediate regimes. In 1990, nearly 70% of all countries were pursuing some variant of intermediate ER regimes, a share that dropped to 41% by the end of the 1990s, and further to 30% in 2004 (figure 2)1. Exits from intermediate regimes were more frequently towards floats rather than to hard pegs. The share of floaters increased from 15% in 1990 to 45% in 2004 while, on the other extreme, the share of hard pegs rose from 15% to 26% during the same time span. The latter increase in hard pegs reflects, to some extent, the establishment of the European Monetary Union in 1999. The share of countries with crawling pegs – a very popular regime among higher-inflation economies – dropped from 14% in                                                       1  A new IMF database of de facto ER regimes adopted by IMF member countries allows to classify countries into three broad ER regimes: hard pegs (formal dollarization, currency union, and currency boards), intermediate regimes (conventional fixed pegs, crawling pegs, crawling bands, and tightly managed floats), and floating ER regimes (managed float with no predetermined ER path and independently floating rates). 
2 BIS Review 68/2007 1990 to 6% in 2001. In contrast, countries with a crawling band or a tightly managed float rose from 10% at the beginning of the 1990s to 31% by the year 2001. Crawling bands offer – at least in the short-term – more flexibility in coping with volatile capital flows and avoiding extreme ER misalignments, than rigid ER regimes. Tightly managed floats, on the other hand, keep the anchoring role of the exchange rate without committing to any explicit target parity. The transition of ER regimes has come with a shift of MP regimes based on an ER or monetary-growth anchor to an IT framework, particularly in emerging economies. The number of countries under IT rose from 8 in 1999 to 21 in 2004 (tables 1-2), and many more are considering to adopt IT in the near future. This transition in MP regime has been more pronounced in Latin America. While in 1994 twelve countries in the region had in place an ER anchor, and four others had a monetary growth anchor, by 2004 only three countries remained with an ER anchor. The transition of policy frameworks during 1994-2004 led to a significant rise in the number of Latin American countries with a floating regime (from three to twelve countries) and an inflation targeting framework (from one to five countries). 2.  Chile’s transition to its current monetary policy framework The macroeconomic institutional and policy framework of Chile has been transformed radically in the last 25 years, from one that made stabilization an exceptional result to one that has facilitated achieving price stability. Chile’s current macroeconomic framework is based on four pillars: (i) an autonomous Central Bank with the explicit mandate of safeguarding stability of prices and payments; (ii) a low public-debt to GDP ratio and a fiscal policy rule anchored to a structural fiscal surplus; (iii) a robust financial system, with a dynamic, competitive, and well capitalized banking industry, appropriately regulated and supervised; and (iv) a full-fledged inflation targeting monetary framework, complemented by a floating ER regime. Substantial progress was made in CBC autonomy since the 1980s, when autonomy was very weak, even at lower levels than in the average emerging economy. The granting of legal independence in 1989 through constitutional law, led to a much improved position in the international ranking of central bank autonomy. Particularly economic independence of central banks – the freedom of taking policy decisions independently of political interference – places Chile well above the average level of independence of both emerging and developed economies in 2003. Chile has shown a responsible fiscal policy, which has contributed significantly to successful monetary policy. During the 1990s, the fiscal balance averaged a surplus of 1.5% of GDP. The above-mentioned structural fiscal surplus rule stabilizes government spending over time, by linking it explicitly to permanent government revenue. Therefore fiscal dominance of monetary policy is ruled out in Chile, as a result of central bank autonomy and Chile’s sound fiscal policy. Public debt has shown a substantial decline since the 1990s, as a result of prudent fiscal policy. The share of consolidated gross public debt has been reduced from 76% of GDP in 1990 to 20% of GDP in 2006, whereas the consolidated net public debt position turned from 34% of GDP in 1990 to -6% in 2006 (figure 3). The successful performance of the fiscal position has been enhanced by the fiscal balance rule applied since 2001 (figure 4). Chile’s good growth performance, complemented by a market-based incentive structure, appropriate regulation and sound supervision of the financial system, has resulted in a safe and sound financial system and deep capital markets. As a result of the major banking crisis that came with the deep 1982-1983 recession, the 1986 Banking Law enhanced regulation and supervision of the financial system. Since then, the financial system has developed around a well-managed and capitalized banking sector that is both healthy and competitive. This feature also rules out financial dominance of monetary policy in Chile. The CBC shares normative attributions with a specialized public institution, focusing on the formulation of financial regulations applicable to monetary markets. Chile’s financial system strength has been acclaimed by international credit rating agencies. Moody’s Financial Strength Ranking places Chile’s financial strength close to the top of industrial countries (figure 5). 
BIS Review 68/2007 3 Monetary policy framework: Central Bank charter and its objectives Although the road to CBC autonomy began in the mid-1970s, the 1989 Constitutional Law of the CBC specified the Bank’s objectives and granted CBC the necessary instruments to comply with its legal mandate. Since 1989, the CBC is an autonomous, technical institution, governed by the Constitution, with full legal capacity, control of its equity, and of indefinite duration. The constitutional law establishes two objectives for the CBC. The first objective is to preserve the stability of Chile’s currency. This means avoiding loss of purchasing power due to inflation. The latter objective is achieved through ensuring that inflation remains low and stable. The second objective of the CBC is to ensure the normal functioning of domestic and external payments, by safeguarding the financial sector’s primary functions of credit and savings intermediation, provision of payment services, and proper risk allocation by financial markets. CBC’s Constitutional Law prohibits CBC credit to the government. In order to contribute to policy coordination and information sharing, and minimizing potential conflict between fiscal and monetary authorities as a consequence of CBC autonomy, the Constitutional Law mandates participation of the Finance Minister at monetary policy meetings, without voting rights but with the temporary right of suspending a Board decision. Furthermore, the Law states that CBC policy decisions must take into account the government’s general economic policy orientation. Overview of the evolution of MP framework The Chilean experience with IT can be split into two periods. The first one – from 1991 to 1999 – falls short in many aspects of a full-fledged inflation targeting framework. This first phase featured more than one anchor (an ER band, in addition to the inflation target) and low levels of MP transparency and communication. The second phase – from 2000 to the present – features a single inflation target and an active communication strategy for MP. In the context of reporting the annual monetary program to the Congress, the CBC announcement of an annual inflation target arose as a natural response to the legal mandate for price-level stability. In 1991, the first official target – at a 15%-20% annual target range – was publicly announced in September 1990 for the Dec. 1990–Dec. 1991 rate of annual CPI inflation. From 1990 to 1996, targets were set annually as target ranges in September for the subsequent calendar year, and from 1997 to 1999 as target points (figure 6). Between 1991 and 2001, annual targets were lowered by 1.5 percentage points per year on average. Inflation performance improved considerably during this period, achieving a reduction from 20%-30% annually to low single-digit rates. However, independence and effectiveness of the MP were hindered by conflicts between the exchange-rate-band, annual inflation targets, and capital controls. Transition to a full-fledged IT framework was implemented when inflation was converging to 3%, monetary policy was strengthened by attainment of inflation targets, the ER band was replaced by a floating ER regime, and capital controls were fully abolished. From 2000 to 2006, the target was defined for annual CPI inflation at a range of 2% to 4%, and the monetary policy horizon was defined as 12 to 24 months. Since 2007, the MP objective is to keep annual CPI inflation rate most of the time at around 3%, within a symmetric tolerance range of one percentage point, focused on a policy horizon of around two years. This target redefinition strengthens the 3% level as the nominal anchor of the economy, while recognizing that inflation can temporarily deviate from the 3+/-1% range to accommodate transitory shocks. In parallel, the horizon for monetary policy was extended to around two years. The latter changes were largely an explicit acknowledgment of how monetary policy had been conducted during preceding years. Transparency and communication In the last decade, central banks around the world have significantly improved their communication with the public and the markets. This provides institutional legitimacy and substantive accountability. More transparency and better communication also improve MP effectiveness, contributing to a better understanding of MP by the private sector. MP affects spending decisions, output, and prices more through its effects on market expectations on the future course of monetary policy, rather than through the direct effects of a change in the short-term MPR. 
4 BIS Review 68/2007 Since 2000 the CBC has made a large effort to deliver more and better information to the markets and to explain how its IT regime operates. A series of communication devices were developed, including disclosure of relevant data with a minimum time lag and making information available on the CBC website, a significant number of technical publications, including the Monetary Policy Report (with a four-monthly frequency, since May 2000); the Financial Stability Report (semi-annual, since 2004); the Monetary Policy Framework document (updated in January 2007, previous in May 2000), and Projection Models book (since 2003). The CBC publishes monthly MP meeting dates six months in advance (since 2000), the summary of MP minutes with the Board members’ voting decisions (since 2000), and background information on MP minutes (since July 2005). The time lag for the release of the minutes was lowered first from 90 to 45 days, and then to five days before the next monthly MP meeting. 3.  Monetary policy results in emerging economies and in Chile Convergence of inflation to developed-country levels There are several empirical studies exploring how emerging economies in general, and Chile in particular, have benefited from implementation of an IT regime. The evidence shows that IT has been very helpful in bringing inflation down to low single-digit levels in emerging economies. It has been shown that the adoption of IT has played a leading role in emerging economies’ successful convergence to inflation levels observed in developed economies (Mishkin and Schmidt-Hebbel, 2007). Small deviations of inflation from target in Chile It has been shown also that IT countries are more successful in attaining their inflation targets than non-IT countries (Mishkin and Schmidt-Hebbel, 2007). The introduction of IT has also helped Chile to attain levels of inflation closer to target levels. Albagli and Schmidt-Hebbel (2004) provide an international comparison of inflation performance and deviations from targets for 21 IT countries. They consider the average relative deviation of inflation from targets since the beginning of IT in each country. The results show that Chile is the second most accurate IT country in hitting its inflation target (figure 7). Since adoption of full-fledged IT by Chile in 2000, average annual inflation has been 2.9%, remaining around 75% of the time within the target range. Only 10% of the time did inflation rate rise above the upper target bound, and 15% of the time inflation fell below the lower bound (figure 8). Inflation targeting and credibility Adoption of IT has also contributed to the buildup of credibility of monetary policy in IT countries. Several authors show that the IT regime has helped in anchoring inflation expectations at levels close to inflation targets and inflation expectations are more stable than in the U.S. (Ramos et al., 2007; Gürkaynak et al., 2007). In Chile, the distance of inflation expectations from inflation targets was closed as targets converged toward the stationary 3% level and the Central Bank showed strong commitment to attaining targets (Céspedes and Soto, 2005). During the past five years, inflation expectations have remained close to the mid-point of the inflation target range, reflecting high credibility of the IT regime (figure 9). Inflation targets and stability Emerging economies have experienced reductions in the volatility of both inflation and output (figure 10). However, volatility reductions have been more pronounced in IT countries than in non-IT countries. Volatilities of growth and inflation have fallen very significantly in Chile, even in comparison to other IT countries. Two factors explain most of the volatility reduction in IT countries: smaller shocks hitting the economy and improvements in monetary policy efficiency (Mishkin and Schmidt-Hebbel, 2007). Figure 11 depicts the estimated average efficiency frontier of MP for emerging economies before their adoption of IT (orange schedule) and the observed pair of output and inflation volatilities (red point). 
BIS Review 68/2007 5 The figure also depicts the estimated average efficiency frontier of MP for emerging economies after IT adoption, for the period of stationary inflation targets (blue line) and the observed pair of output and inflation volatilities (green dot). On one hand, the shift of the efficiency frontier toward the origin reflects the smaller shocks faced by emerging economies since they have had stationary IT in place. On the other hand, the observed combination of output and inflation volatilities has moved closer to the efficiency frontier, revealing the corresponding improvement in monetary policy efficiency. In this case, the smaller shocks explain 58% of the current performance, while the improvements in monetary policy explain 42% of the decline in volatilities. Chile also records massive improvements in monetary policy management. Not only does Chile face smaller shocks, as reflected by the inward shift of the MP efficiency frontier, but also MP efficiency has improved significantly, as reflected by the closer position of observed volatilities to the efficiency frontier (see figure 12). Contribution of central bank policy to macroeconomic stability Emerging economies have improved MP practices. However, the contribution of monetary policy to macroeconomic performance still is low. The annual Report on Competitiveness prepared by the Institute for Management Development (IMD) shows that the positions of emerging economies in the country ranking of the contribution of central bank policy to development has not changed significantly since 1998. However, Chile has recorded major improvements during the past decade. In 1998, the CBC was ranked 25 among 60 countries, while reaching the first place in the world ranking in 2004, holding this place in the subsequent years (figures 13-14). 4.  Conclusions Macroeconomic conditions have improved significantly in emerging economies since the early 1990s. Emerging economies show major progress in fiscal responsibility and sustainability; adoption of a framework of central bank autonomy, monetary regimes based on IT, and larger exchange-rate flexibility; and achievement of financial system strength. Adoption of more flexible exchange rates and an IT regime has contributed to lower output and inflation volatility, and stronger credibility of central bank policies. Macroeconomic stability is often accomplished gradually. Chile adopted the IT regime in two distinct phases and implemented a solid macroeconomic framework based on central bank autonomy with a clear focus on price stability. This was supported by a solvent, responsible, and predictable fiscal policy and a solid and well-regulated financial system. Chile’s good record of attaining inflation levels close to the target has strengthened private sector confidence in the CBC and raised MP effectiveness and credibility. Low inflation and a credible monetary policy represent an essential macroeconomic achievement. By improving its policy framework, supported by strong transparency, accountability, and communication, the CBC has laid a major foundation to Chile’s macroeconomic stability. Yet the conquest and predictability of inflation are not guaranteed. The CBC will remain vigilant, improving its policy framework as needed to continue delivering high levels of macroeconomic stability. References Albagli, E. and K.

Jean-Pierre Roth: Recent economic and financial developments in Switzerland Introductory remarks by Mr Jean-Pierre Roth, Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank for International Settlements, at the half-yearly media news conference, Berne, 14 June 2007. *      *      * The Swiss National Bank is raising the target range for the three-month Libor with immediate effect by 0.25 percentage points to 2.00–3.00%. With this move, the National Bank is ensuring that inflation prospects remain favourable. The SNB intends to hold the rate in the middle of the target range for the time being. Switzerland's economy is in excellent shape. Indeed, the economy is developing even better than expected back in March. For 2007, the National Bank now expects real GDP to grow at a rate of close to 2.5%. The healthy economy in the neighbouring countries and exchange rate developments have been contributing factors. Together with a renewed rise in oil prices, this has led to a slight deterioration in inflation prospects – even after today's increase in the interest rate. Assuming that the three-month Libor remains unchanged at 2.50%, the National Bank expects an average annual inflation rate of 0.8% in 2007, 1.5% in 2008, and 1.7% in 2009. Consequently, forecast inflation continues to rise. However, at present there is considerable uncertainty with regard to the assessment of the inflation outlook. On the one hand, structural changes in the economy still have a dampening effect on prices. On the other hand, given the high level of capacity utilisation and movements in the exchange rate, there is a danger that higher production costs will increasingly be passed on to prices. Should economic momentum remain unchanged or should movements in the Swiss franc result in a further relaxation of monetary conditions, further increases in the interest rate are likely in the months ahead. Economic outlook The international environment has a strong impact on economic developments in Switzerland. According to the IMF forecasts, the global economy is poised to grow at a sustained rate of approximately 5% in 2007. While the economic activity in the United States has been satisfactory, it is a little less dynamic than expected. By contrast, the economic situation in Europe is clearly healthier than we had expected. This encouraging development has had a favourable impact on our economy. Economic activity in Switzerland continued to be dynamic in the first months of the year. In the first quarter, gross domestic product (GDP) was up by 3.2% saar, exceeding the long-term average growth rate by a significant amount.  The strong economic performance assisted the recovery of the labour market. Employment was up in industry as well as in the construction and service areas. As a result, unemployment figures dropped further and the unemployment rate fell below the level of 3%. Demand indicators were still trending upwards, which should result in a renewed drop in unemployment in the months ahead. Moreover, labour demand continued to be met by a significant influx of labour from abroad. The opening of the labour market within the context of the bilateral agreements with the EU creates additional growth potential. The competitive position of our economy is high, and the recent depreciation of the Swiss franc on the foreign exchange market gave it an additional boost. While exports continued to increase at a rapid pace, their growth rate may slow down somewhat compared with 2006. The healthy state of the economy and the improvement in the labour market have a favourable impact on consumer sentiment. Since the beginning of the year, household spending has been increasing at very steady pace. A continuance of this trend is possible, since the current near full employment is likely to lead to an increase in real wages. During the next quarters, companies will continue to step up equipment investment since the rate of technical capacity utilisation – in particular in the manufacturing sector – is high. Construction investment should stabilise at a high level. BIS Review 67/2007 1 
These developments in demand components led us to revise our GDP growth forecast upwards for 2007. For the current year, we now expect growth close to 2.5%. Development in monetary and financial conditions In the Swiss capital market, we have been observing a steady increase in long-term interest rates over the past three months. The yield on 10-year Swiss Confederation bonds reached 3% in May. Real interest rates for long maturities have therefore registered an increase. This is a new development because up until now, long-term interest rates had not clearly reacted to the progressive increase in the Libor. This will reinforce our efforts to tighten monetary conditions, since economic activity reacts more noticeably to long-term interest rates than to short-term ones. By contrast, in foreign exchange markets, movements in the Swiss franc have resulted in a relaxation of monetary conditions. As of the beginning of 2006, the Swiss franc started losing ground steadily vis-à-vis the euro. However, it firmed slightly against the dollar during the same period. Since our March assessment, the actual depreciation of the Swiss franc, i.e. weighted in terms of exports , amounts to 1.7%. The corresponding relaxation in monetary conditions is weakening the effects of our policy of lifting interest rates and is increasing inflationary pressure through two channels. One the one hand, it is bringing about an increase in import prices, which could have an effect on consumer prices. Even though the impact of this channel may have diminished during the past few years due to increased competition, there is no guarantee that – against the current backdrop of near full employment – it will not again be reactivated. On the other hand, it is strengthening the competitive position of our economy, thereby giving exports and economic activity a boost. As a consequence, the weak franc could heighten inflationary pressure in an economy already running at full steam. On the credit market, growth in mortgage lending is slowly receding, with the current rate of increase below 5%. The “other loans” category continues to expand rapidly, while matching observations of the past in comparable phases of the economic cycle. This category is now growing at a rate of about 8–10%, as at the beginning of the 2000s, when their level in fact considerably exceeded the levels we are currently experiencing. M1 and M2 shrank, which is nothing out of the ordinary during a phase of rising interest rates. When this happens, savings and sight deposits are shifted into time deposits. M1 and M2 are affected by this substitution. M3, which is not affected, is growing at a rate of 2% to 3%, which is appropriate for an expanding economy. Inflationary risks In the current environment, price stability is subject to three types of risk:  The first risk is connected with the development in the price of oil. The barrel price for Brent crude rose by 40%, from USD 51.0 in January to USD 71.7 in May. This will lead to higher inflation during the course of the year. Unlike oil price hikes between 2004 and 2006, the most recent rally took place when capacity utilisation was higher. If the current surge in oil prices were to continue, it could affect prices more easily than previously. The second risk is due to the fact that demand is growing at too rapid a pace in relation to the development in production capacity. We estimate the GDP growth rate that can be sustained without pushing up inflation – potential GDP growth – at between 1.5% and 2%. This is lower than the growth rate we have observed since 2006. Measuring the output gap is tricky, however, because certain favourable factors, such as the influx of skilled labour, the deregulation of certain domestic markets and increased global competition might have pushed up potential GDP growth. Having said this, however, we should not overlook those factors which have the opposite effect. For instance, equipment investment has receded, which has a dampening effect on potential growth. Moreover, even if capacity utilisation as a whole is not excessive, bottlenecks might occur in certain sectors of the economy. And, above all, experience has shown that the output gap is often underestimated during phases of growth. Consequently, the risk of underestimating the output gap may now be greater than that of overestimating it. The third risk is associated with the future development of the Swiss franc. As its exchange rate is determined by the market, it is subject to fluctuations. Movements in the export-weighted Swiss franc index alter the degree of restrictiveness of our monetary policy. Normally, during periods of rising 2 BIS Review 67/2007 
interest rates, this index tends to increase, thereby amplifying the effects of monetary policy by mitigating price increases in imported products and slowing the expansion in economic activity. This reaction pattern was not observed during the past two years, which could put pressure on interest rates. Monetary policy decision Before commenting our decision today, I would like to point out the changes that are shaping our current environment. In December 2005, when the present cycle of interest rate hikes began, we were concerned with the normalisation of the interest rate level – at the time the Libor was at 0.75% – while allowing the economy to reduce its level of unused resources. Our concern now is to ensure that monetary conditions are such that the healthy state of the economy does not jeopardise price stability in the medium term. We are still observing that the competitive pressure in the market is high, the labour market very flexible and that movement in the monetary aggregates is moderate. However, my analysis of the current situation has demonstrated that the inflation outlook has deteriorated in different respects since our last assessment: higher oil prices will have an impact on the consumer price index; economic performance, which is better than expected, will result in an improved utilisation rate and increase pressure on prices and, finally, a renewed weakening of the Swiss franc has neutralised the intended tightening in monetary conditions. Today's decision to raise the target range for the three-month Libor by 25 basis points takes into account this deterioration in the outlook for price stability. Inflation forecast graph I will now turn to the last part of my remarks. What is our inflation forecast? The dashed red curve represents the new forecast which covers the period from the second quarter of 2007 to the first quarter 2010. It shows the inflation outlook after today's increase in the Libor under the assumption that the level of 2.50% will be kept constant during the forecasting period. For purposes of comparison, the dash-dotted green curve shows the inflation forecast of the March monetary assessment which was based on a Libor of 2.25%. The combined effect of higher oil prices, economic developments that were better than expected and a weaker franc leads to a deterioration in the inflation forecast for the coming months. Today's interest rate rise will stabilise the rate of inflation at a slightly higher level from mid-2008 onwards than that established last March. Inflation will subsequently continue to rise and approach the 2% mark towards the end of the forecasting period. * * * In lifting the three-month Libor by 25 basis points today, deterioration in the inflation prospects over the past months will be offset. Any forecast and any decision are obviously fraught with uncertainty and risk. Should economic momentum remain unchanged or should movements in the Swiss franc result in a further relaxation in monetary conditions, further increases in the interest rate are likely in the months ahead.

Thomas Jordan: Currency reserve adjustments, the SIC payments system and financial market developments Introductory remarks by Mr Thomas Jordan, Member of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the half-yearly media news conference, Berne, 14 June 2007. *      *      * In my remarks, I would like to address three topics. First, I will speak about the adjustments in the composition of our currency reserves. Then, I would like to comment on the Swiss Interbank Clearing (SIC) payment system and its twenty years of existence. At the end, I will say a few words about developments in the financial markets. 1.  Adjustments in the composition of currency reserves The Swiss National Bank is adjusting the composition of its currency reserves. Before the end of September 2009 it will sell 250 tonnes of gold and increase its foreign exchange reserves by a corresponding amount. The overall level of currency reserves will remain unchanged. The gold sales fall within the bounds set by the second Gold Agreement of 8 March 2004, in which the central banks of the Eurosystem, plus the Sveriges Riksbank and the Swiss National Bank, agreed to limit their gold sales over a period of five years, beginning on 28 September 2004. The Gold Agreement specifies that annual sales by all signatories may not exceed 500 tonnes and that the total sales volume over this period shall not amount to more than 2,500 tonnes. For the gold sales it was planning, the SNB was allocated a quota not claimed by other central banks that were party to the agreement of 2004. The SNB has chosen an approach for its gold sales that will avoid market unrest, with regular sales transactions. The Swiss National Bank holds currency reserves in the form of foreign currency and gold, thereby ensuring that it has room for manoeuvre in its monetary policy at all times. As a result of the sharp rise in the price of gold, the proportion of the currency reserves held as gold has increased by about a quarter since mid 2005, from 33% to the current level of 42%. The purpose of the SNB's gold sales is to rebalance the composition of currency reserves with respect to its monetary policy requirements. Moreover, by reducing its gold reserves and increasing its foreign exchange reserves, the overall risk on SNB assets will decline. Once the sales have been completed, the Swiss National Bank's gold holdings will amount to some 1,040 tonnes. 2.  Swiss Interbank Clearing (SIC) to celebrate its 20th anniversary Over the next few days, the Swiss Interbank Clearing System SIC will celebrate its 20th anniversary. In 1987, the introduction of the SIC payment system represented a revolution for Swiss payment transactions. SIC was one of the first payment systems in the world of the type known as Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS). Before the introduction of SIC, payments in Switzerland were first offset against each other through a system of eight clearing houses. The net positions were then settled through the banks’ sight deposits at the SNB. This system was extremely cumbersome, costly and fraught with large credit and systemic risks. In SIC by contrast, all payments are settled individually and directly via sight deposits at the SNB. Thus, the payments are final and irrevocable – just like cash payments. SIC is extremely efficient and has drastically reduced credit and systemic risks. It is one of the most secure and cost-effective systems in the world. Nowadays, SIC forms the backbone of Switzerland’s payment system. Not only interbank payment transactions, but also payment transactions between PostFinance and banks as well as cashless retail payment transactions are essentially carried out via SIC. In addition, the international foreign currency settlement system, Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS), is linked to SIC. SIC, together with the trading platforms of SWX/Eurex and the securities settlement system SECOM of SIS, forms the Swiss Value Chain, Switzerland’s integrated financial market infrastructure. The SIC payment system is of utmost importance for financial stability and the implementation of the SNB’s monetary policy. Our BIS Review 67/2007 1 
monetary policy instruments are tailored to the palette of integrated SIC functions within the framework of the Swiss Value Chain. Initially, the SIC turnover in terms of value amounted to CHF 100 billion per working day; it currently stands at CHF 180 billion. The number of transactions, however, has increased far more markedly. One year after the SIC launch, approximately 130,000 transactions were processed each day. Now, twenty years later, an average of 1.3 billion – i.e. ten times more – transactions are carried out per working day. The growth trend for SIC looks set to continue its upward path. The rise in turnover and transactions depends largely on economic growth, technical innovations in payment instruments and developments in the Swiss financial centre. The SNB has partially outsourced its SIC operations. SIC AG, a Telekurs Group company, is responsible for technical operations and for further development of the system. The SNB steers the liquidity in the SIC system, sets the conditions for participation and is responsible for crisis management. Cooperation between SIC AG and the SNB is excellent. The SNB would like to congratulate SIC AG and Telekurs Group on this anniversary and thank them for the outstanding quality of their work. The boards of directors of SWX Group, SIS Group and Telekurs Group have recently signed a declaration of intent regarding the merger of their companies, with the goal of founding a Swiss financial centre infrastructure holding company. SIC AG, or rather Telekurs Group, would be part of this holding company. The SNB is affected by this development in different ways. On the one hand, we are a direct contractual partner of all three companies involved. On the other hand, it is our task to oversee the systemically relevant payments and securities settlement systems. The Swiss Value Chain, run by the three companies, is of vital importance for the implementation of monetary policy. There is no alternative infrastructure for our monetary policy operations. Therefore, we will keep a very close watch on further developments in this area. 3.  Developments in the financial markets The positive underlying sentiment in the international financial markets remained largely unchanged in the first half of 2007, despite some turbulence in the stock markets, which was rather strong at times, and some difficulties in the US sub-prime mortgage market. On 27 February, after a correction in the Chinese stock market, major falls in share prices were recorded worldwide. The price decline temporarily gave rise to fears that the current bull market, which has lasted for many years now, could come to an end. After only a few days, however, the markets returned to normal. A few weeks later, most share indices had already compensated the losses (figure 1). A further correction has occurred in the past few days. However, despite this turbulence, the rise in implicit volatilities – a measure of expected uncertainty – has been relatively insignificant and short-lived in historical terms. Implicit volatilities are still at a very low level (figure 2). In addition, interest premiums on credit risks both for companies and emerging economies remain low, although yields on long-term government bonds have increased markedly since the beginning of March. As in the case of the financial market turbulence of May 2006, the latest correction on the stock market has been negotiated without any major difficulties. The positive underlying sentiment in the markets and the appetite for high-risk investments remained for the most part unabated. Not least, this is probably attributable to the extensive investment requirements worldwide and the associated high level of liquidity on the part of the investors. This large requirement for high-risk investments originates from the dynamic growth rate that has prevailed for some time now, a high savings ratio worldwide, the globalisation and liberalisation of the financial markets as well as the increasingly professionalised asset management by private, government and institutional investors. The durability of the valuation of high-risk investments is extremely difficult to assess, since valuations depend on subjective expectations of future earnings, discount rates and volatilities. The latest turbulence is a salutary reminder of the risks, however. In the past, risk premiums at levels lower than ever recorded before, rapidly rising prices for many high-risk investment categories and hectic activity in the area of company acquisitions have been signs of developments that were not sustainable in the long run. Therefore, market participants should not allow themselves to be distracted by the short-lived nature of financial market setbacks so far and simply extrapolate the favourable market trends of the past few years into the future. 2 BIS Review 67/2007 
The steady rise in the prices of high-risk investments, the low risk premiums and low volatilities might possibly even have an influence on the external value of the Swiss franc. Let me comment on this statement in a little more detail. In international currency portfolios, the Swiss franc has always been a safe haven currency. In the past, this was reflected in the fact that the Swiss franc rose against other investments when the situation was uncertain. Thus, the Swiss franc took on a kind of insurance function and many investors held Swiss franc investments to protect themselves against political and economic crises. Just as the Swiss franc is particularly attractive as a safe haven in stormy conditions, there is little interest in the Swiss franc when the weather is calm. Due to the very low level of risk awareness and risk aversion at present, the demand generated for hedging and thus for Swiss francs is weak. However, in the past, phases of calm weather in foreign exchange markets were repeatedly interspersed with stormy periods. Therefore, financial market participants and other market players with exchange rate exposures should remain aware of the exchange rate risks they are incurring.   BIS Review 67/2007 3

Krzysztof Rybiński: The role of the EURO for the future of Poland Speech by Mr Krzysztof Rybiński, Deputy President of the National Bank of Poland, at the International Conference “The role of the EURO for the future of Poland”, Warsaw, 15 June 2007. *      *      * Only a few months ago the eurozone was enlarged for the second time. Slovenia became the first of the twelve new member states of the EU and the thirteenth country to adopt the common European currency. Now two other countries, i.e. Malta and Cyprus, are knocking on the euro’s door, and others are lining up for the “monetary club membership”. This seems to be a good occasion to return to the, once lively, discussion about the advantages and disadvantages of joining the monetary union.  Indeed, there are still more reasons to come back periodically to the euro cost & benefit debate, since we have more and more data, the world changes rapidly and even economic theory is subject to evolution. Let me illustrate this with one example. It has long been a widely accepted view that asymmetric shocks are the biggest threat to currency unions. Nowadays some respected economists think it may not be the case. And thus, Willem Buiter and Erik Nielsen in their recent paper (2007): “Mundell on His Head: Asymmetric shocks are good for you, thanks to Economic and Monetary Union in Europe”, argue that home bias has been receding in the Eurozone, so an increasing number of households and companies now hold a Euro-wide portfolio. In finance it is good when returns on particular assets are negatively correlated, because it helps you to diversify risk and achieve the better risk-return tradeoff. Therefore, if asymmetric shocks hit monetary union, it will result in negatively correlated returns on euro-zone assets portfolio, so such portfolio holders will be better off in comparison with a scenario of a symmetric negative shock. Of course this train of thought may seem too narrow, since it boils down merely to the capital income analysis and loses sight of other effects of asymmetric shocks, such as those on the labor market situation. Nevertheless, this example provides a clear evidence that our cost and benefit analysis may change every so often in tandem with new ideas that smart people come up with. However, before I proceed, I would like to make two important points. First, I would like to note that views presented here are my own and they do not represent the official position of the National Bank of Poland. Second, my economic background allows me to speak in terms of standard economic variables: output, consumption, prices etc. On the other hand, I do not feel competent to speak about highly immeasurable values like national pride. Notwithstanding the fact that people might derive utility from the pure fact of having in their wallets banknotes with Polish kings instead of European bridges, I have no idea how to measure this utility and how to compare it to the utility derived from more standard arguments of preference functions like consumption. For this reason I will speak in terms of standard macroeconomic variables, bearing in mind that this is certainly not the whole story. If economists speak about the advantages and disadvantages of joining a common currency area, they ultimately end up comparing the costs and benefits of accession. This is also the way I would like to proceed. However, bearing in mind that many issues have already been described in several voluminous reports (NBP 2004 for Poland, Csajbok, Csemerly 2002 for Hungary, HM Treasury 2003 for the UK), I will try to focus on issues which are less familiar to the general public or which are potential risk factors. The nature of these issues is that they are mainly concentrated on the cost side of the analysis. Thus, it might seem from my lecture, that I mainly care about the costs or that costs outweigh benefits. Let me, in the very beginning, stress that this is by no means the case. As stated by the President of the National Bank of Poland, Mr Sławomir Skrzypek, an in-depth assessment of the costs and benefits of the euro adoption in Poland needs to be periodically repeated in order to make sure that we take into account all important factors of the fast changing global economy. The National Bank of Poland is willing to play a key role in stimulating the public debate about the costs and benefits of the euro adoption. Today’s conference is a good moment to contribute to this debate, and I would like to thank the organizers for offering this opportunity. Let me begin with the benefit side. Economists typically concentrate on the following sources of economic benefits related to monetary union. These are: • lower transaction costs, • lower interest rates, • financial integration, BIS Review 67/2007 1 
• trade creation. Elimination of transaction costs incurred by companies and households in relation to the zloty/euro exchange rate is among the most obvious benefits of the single currency. These costs include, inter alia, the bid-ask spreads, fees accompanying exchange rate operations and costs of hedging against exchange rate risk. Any company could possibly calculate how much it would save on transaction costs if there were no exchange rates. This is also relatively unsophisticated for the whole economy, and has been estimated to be approximately 0.2% of GDP in Poland (NBP 2004). Not much, but worth saving. Lower interest rates induce investment, thus strengthening the productive capacity of the economy and making higher output and consumption possible. We expect that in the case of Poland the interest rate adjustment after eurozone accession will reduce long-term rates by more than one percentage point. Any estimation of the exact impact on investment, output and consumption is subject to several assumptions. Nevertheless the NBP’s analyses show that an interest rate reduction will be the main source of benefits from joining the euro (Borowski 2003). Research shows that the elimination of the exchange rate fluctuations and the coordination of monetary policy within the euro zone have been the main driving forces behind the financial integration in Europe (Fratzscher 2001; Galati and Tsatsaronis 2001; European Commission 2002; ECB 2006). Integration, in turn, promotes competition in financial markets, leading to an improved efficiency in financial intermediaries and a reduction in the cost of their services. A single currency provides domestic companies with an access to more liquid and deeper financial markets, which not only drives down the cost of capital, but also allows better risk diversification. Therefore, apart from stimulating economic growth, development of financial market also reduces output fluctuations. Since empirical research indicates that countries with relatively less developed financial markets benefit the most from financial integration (Giannetti et al. 2002), we believe that Poland should be among the largest beneficiaries of this process (NBP 2004). The benefit we know the least about is related to trade creation. In a groundbreaking study Rose (2000) estimated that joining a currency union may boost cross-country trade by over 200%. Most economists have agreed with the direction and mechanism behind this – the single currency eliminates the uncertainty related to exchange rate movements and thus diminishes the risk related to foreign trade. However, the estimated scale seems to be much exaggerated. One problematic issue is related to the fact that before the eurozone, we did not have examples of currency unions between developed countries. So the Rose study was based on data on currency unions involving poor and/ or small countries. As noted by Micco, Stein and Ordonez (2003), “one does not need to be a eurosceptic to wonder whether such findings are directly applicable to Europe’s single currency”. Follow-up studies (e.g. Rose and Wincoop (2001), Kenen (2002), Persson (2001)) attempted to correct the Rose’s estimates but arrived, rather inconclusively, at anything between a 50% and 150% growth of bilateral trade. Recently, the first studies based on euro area data have emerged. These show that the trade creation effect of the euro has been substantial, although (until now) by an order of magnitude smaller that the original Rose’s estimate (e.g. Micco, Stein and Ordonez (2003)). Our knowledge about trade creation effects of the euro is still far from complete and we will probably have to wait another 10+ years to have enough data to draw firm conclusions about its magnitude in the eurozone. Now let me move to the cost side. As already noted in contrast to the benefits, some costs have a contingent character. They are tail-events – rather unlikely but with a possibly high impact if they occur. Let me focus on two issues: • asymmetric shocks, • arising micro- and macroeconomic imbalances. Shocks are by definition something we cannot foresee. Asymmetric shocks are shocks that affect only selected member(s) of a monetary union. Such events are considered the biggest threat to unions (Mundell 1961), because joining a common currency area substantially reduces the set of policy tools which could be used to mitigate the impact of the shock. Let us assume that a negative demand shock affects the Polish economy (e.g. consumers decide to buy less Polish goods and services). In the short and medium run, this brings about a reduction in output and higher unemployment. As long as Poland has its own currency, it can use both monetary and fiscal policy to stimulate demand and reduce the impact of the shock on output and employment. Moreover, the exchange rate might adjust (depreciate) and thus make our exports more price-competitive. Once in the eurozone, two of these 2 BIS Review 67/2007 
channels are closed. First, there is no independent domestic monetary policy which could lower interest rates, and one should not expect the ECB to react to a local shock. Second, after joining the monetary union, the Polish currency will be replaced with the euro, so the zloty/euro exchange rate adjustments will no longer be available. Accordingly, the only policy tool left after euro area accession is fiscal policy. For this reason it is of crucial importance to run a balanced budget in the medium run, so that in case of negative shocks, there is room for increasing the deficit, and thus buffer the shock. Additionally, there are also economic forces which can bring the economy back to equilibrium. The most prominent is wage adjustment – after a negative shock, falling wages can help reduce the cost of production and – as a consequence – prices. This will increase demand and help the economy return to equilibrium. A crucial prerequisite for this channel to operate smoothly is a flexible labor market – only if wages adjust immediately, can an increasing unemployment and an economic slowdown be avoided. We know, however, that this downward wage flexibility is rarely seen in real life. Regarding asymmetric shocks, one thing seems certain. We are not able to foresee if serious asymmetric shocks are going to affect the Polish economy after joining the euro or not. We can only speak in terms of probabilities and, given the data, it seems that the probability of huge shocks occurrence seems limited. The Polish economy is strongly integrated with the eurozone, with a majority of exports going to the common currency area. Moreover, most studies (e.g. Fidrmuc, Korhonen 2003, Eickmeier, Breitung 2005) show a relatively high correlation of business cycles between Poland and the eurozone. This substantially reduces, though does not eliminate, the risk of asymmetric shocks. Looking ahead, one can see potential risk factors. One of them is production clustering. If the recently observed trend for country specialization (e.g. Slovakia specializes in producing cars, India in business process outsourcing) holds on, it may increase the risk of asymmetric shocks in the future (De Grauwe 2003). Another example of a possibly distant future asymmetric “shock” is global warming. A recent report cited by Financial Times (FT, 6 January 2007) shows that the Northern members of the eurozone are likely to profit and the Southern members to suffer from the climate change. Nevertheless, whatever the likelihood of shocks, it remains of crucial importance to maintain a balanced fiscal perspective and flexible labor market which can absorb shocks, should they arise. Now let me move to the possibility of rising micro- and macroeconomic imbalances. They can take the form of lending booms, current account deficits or increasing inflation pressure. Such a set of symptoms in a monetary union member country reveals in most cases one common cause – too low a level of real interest rates. Economists have for a long time argued that each economy has an appropriate, long-run level of the real interest rate called the natural rate of interest (Wicksell 1898). Keeping interest rates at this (unfortunately unobserved) level should guarantee that the economy will remain in equilibrium – output will not exceed production capacity and inflation will remain stable (Woodford 2003). This is what implicitly or explicitly most inflation targeting central banks are trying to achieve. One of the problems with joining a common currency area might be that real interest rates in this area will be lower than the natural rate of the new member. Recent research shows that this might be the case for Poland, where the natural rate has remained in the past above the euro area level (Brzoza-Brzezina 2006). For Poland, entering the eurozone means lower nominal interest rates (the spread on long-term rates still exceeds 100 basis points) and higher inflation (due to appreciation of the real exchange rate related to the catching up process, with no longer available nominal exchange rate channel). Together this means a drop in real interest rates, which could induce people and enterprises to substantially increase borrowing, and spend the loans on consumption and investment goods. What could be the consequences of this? First, if borrowing accelerates massively, banks may start extending loans without properly checking their customers’ creditworthiness – this could result in bad debt problems. It is a well known phenomenon (e.g. Demirgüç-Kunt, Detragiache 1998, Gourinchas et al. 2001) that lending booms are often followed by banking sector crises. Fortunately, recent research on the potential for lending booms in Poland after euro area accession forecasts a rather moderate increase in lending (Schadler et al. 2005, Brzoza-Brzezina 2005), and shows that the expected credit growth is rather an equilibrium phenomenon – a structural adjustment that should not have negative consequences (Kiss at al. 2006). Nevertheless, even if a serious lending boom during euro area accession seems unlikely, policymakers should remain vigilant and prudent banking sector supervision should be the right answer to protect oneself against the risk of such developments. BIS Review 67/2007 3 
Second, higher domestic demand can fuel inflation pressure and increase imports, thus leading to a higher current account deficit. As for the latter, it seems that while outside a monetary union deep current account deficits worry investors and can, in extreme situations, lead to currency crises, for countries that have already joined the common currency such developments do not matter much. An example of the three Baltic States (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania), whose currency board arrangements are close equivalents of a monetary union, shows that enormous current account deficits (9-16% of GDP in 2006) have no apparent negative consequences for the economy, as yet. The case is, however, different with inflation pressure. In theory, the margin for local demand-driven price increases in small member states of monetary unions is very narrow. This is guaranteed by the so called law of one price – the expectation that the same product should have the same price in various countries of a monetary union. In practice, however, there are several obstacles for this law to hold perfectly – some goods cannot be traded, most goods do not have perfect substitutes, there are transportation costs and tax differentials – so local demand pressures can play a role in driving prices in monetary union member states. As a consequence, products manufactured in these countries become more expensive and such countries loose competitiveness (e.g. Estrada, Lopez-Salido 2001). It is relatively difficult to foresee how the Polish economy will react to demand pressures once in the euro area. However, as in the case of asymmetric shocks, labor market flexibility is probably the best answer to the described phenomena. It allows a smooth and relatively painless adjustment if the economy looses competitiveness. Summing up, I have discussed selected aspects of the cost-benefit analysis of Poland’s adoption of the euro, with a special focus on issues which are less familiar to the general public. As I argued, some costs will materialize if asymmetric shocks hit the enlarged eurozone. We do not know the likelihood of such shocks though, so it is impossible to calculate the expected value of costs related to these events. We know, however, that the probability of asymmetric shocks declines with rising similarity or progressing real convergence of the EU economies. Let me also stress that the magnitude of costs depends crucially on domestic policy – prudent banking sector supervision, labor market reforms and sound fiscal policies to name a few. Adoption of proper policies reduces future potential costs related to euro-zone membership and, at the same time, enhances future benefits. In my view, given the evidence that reforms have been halted in many countries after entering the eurozone, these measures should be taken before the euro area accession.

Radovan Jelašić: Provision of credits to small and medium sized enterprises in Serbia Speech by Mr Radovan Jelašić, Governor of the National Bank of Serbia, at the Roundtable organized by “Ekonomist” Magazine on Provision of Credits to Small and Medium Sized Enterprises in Serbia, held at the National Bank of Serbia, Belgrade, 13 June 2007. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen, Allow me to welcome you on behalf of the National Bank of Serbia on the occasion of conference on medium and small size enterprise crediting in Serbia. I would like to discuss two related subjects – stability of prices, i.e. inflation, and the role of the NBS in providing credits to finance small and medium sized enterprises. Stability of prices and business environment represent one of the key conditions for the success of economy as a whole and particularly so for the success of small and medium-sized enterprises. In contrast to large enterprises that have “connections”, access to insider information and are more than aware of their economic and political power, medium and small sized enterprises are usually treated as an ornament, more as a social than economic category – and that serves them no purpose. As for stability in prices, it is currently at the level most people do not remember ever having seen before because, back than, they were either not yet born or were not really very much interested in such matters at all. Inflation today, after 44 years to the day, matches the level recorded in 1963. In May this year, year-on-year, the rate of headline inflation equalled 4.4% and core inflation reached 3.o%. At the same time, our economy has been growing at the rate of around 7% (first quarter 2007 over the same period a year earlier) and displaying a greater abundance and variety of cheap credits than seen in Serbia in a long time, the exchange rate for the dinar has been floating freely for over three months now without any interventions from the NBS, and our foreign exchange reserves have grown in excess of US$ 12.2 billion. Stability seems to have brought about a number of unexpected effects of “operating in a normal business environment”, which almost whole of our economy has kind of grown unaccustomed to in the course of these last 44 years, such as the facts that: • Market implies competition, glorifies success and puts a persistent pressure on increase in productivity. One can no longer get by with phrases like: “Here I am, a smart lad, successful, good looking ….look at me… it is the exchange rate….it is unrealistic, interest rates are sky high, they have put up all these administrative barriers and…..what happens…. it is my product that flops in the market.” Of course, it is much easier to build castles in the air and to think that we would have been successful if only somebody else, most likely the state, were to provide the “right” conditions for us, than to face all the harshness of reality!  • What matters in a market determined environment is not only to offer high quality goods and services. You also need to have a good banker, to be aware of all the risks and to hedge against them. To keep making progress in your profession, you also need to be kind of a visionary!  Reality is often harsh and life seems much easier and prettier when engulfed in the haze of inflation and instability to which, to tell the truth, majority of us had to get used during the last several decades. Such environment was created by the state, and exclusively so, and I am amazed to see that citizens and businessmen are still appealing to that very state expecting it to resolve their problems, and not only the general operating conditions, but to provide them with incentives, subsidies, price regressing, new loans, etc. as well. Bearing in mind that the country is undergoing transition, we should be satisfied with the current rate of inflation in Serbia. I wish to point out that the NBS has won its first “battle” against inflation, and that it shall win all the rest of them. However, the “war” has only begun, and both sides are, to speak figuratively, currently mobilizing their forces. The key question is which side shall the budget take in this battle – not in declarative terms, but in terms of numbers! Defences put up by the NBS to maintain stability in prices managed to hold against a wave of consumption growth in late last and early this year pending parliamentary elections. Let me remind you of the fact that when we were setting BIS Review 66/2007 1 
inflation targets we could not have predicted new elections, which always imply increase in expenditures. Now, when the elections are over, both Serbia and the NBS deserve to have a reform-oriented and restrictive budget and a chance to take a deep breath in terms of monetary policy, to think of what next to do. The difference between a successful man and a failure is not in the fact that one knows and the other one does not know what it is he should do, but in the fact that one works and the other one just keeps talking. There is hardly another issue in Serbia today on which more people agree than the fact that public sector wages have been growing way too much and way too fast and that they should be cut back to a lower level. Let me point out that if anybody thinks that this cut should be made at the expense of the National Bank of Serbia, that is, inflation, he is very much in the wrong. Such calculations are totally misplaced. The NBS shall do all it can to prevent such outcome and, let me remind you that we have already shown how successful we can be in that respect! Each day that is lost in terms of not decreasing the wage bill in the public sector and public enterprises – and I repeat, wage bill not individual wages – is a lost day. I guarantee that you are not going to see the return to the monetary fairy tale that has lasted for the last four decades and, even if Serbia does not get the budget it deserves, there is not going to be an increase in inflation. You may ask, how so? And I say, in the following way. As has so far been the case, the NBS will be forced to increase the level of restrictiveness of the monetary policy (which means higher repo rate, higher reserve requirement, etc.) to compensate for the insufficiently tight fiscal policy. The NBS has a clear task – “to achieve and maintain price stability”. That task is in compliance with the law, and we shall certainly do our best to achieve it. As far back as in 2001, the NBS gave strong support to provision of credits to small and medium sized enterprises in Serbia by acting as an agent for extension of credit lines of the European Agency for Reconstruction, European Investment Bank and the Government of Italy. Through these credit lines, end-beneficiaries have so far been granted credits in the total amount of almost RSD 7 billion. In addition, the Governor is a member of the advisory body of the European Fund for South East Europe, the largest fund set up for exclusive use by the countries of the Central and East Europe, which has almost half a billion euros in its coffers from private investors and the EU tax payers. However, in Serbia today, the banking sector is developing so swiftly that the question arises as to the competitiveness of the above credit lines from the point of view of their terms and conditions, though such terms have been improved several times. We shall continue our efforts to improve terms of these credit lines in agreement with the Government of the Republic of Serbia and the donors but, on the longer run, our banks should also be finding greater interest in extending credits to small and medium sized enterprises. They shall certainly be forced to do so by the competition and long-term business interest. If small and medium-sized enterprises are important to the state, then they should be given its support, and not by political declarations, but by taking concrete steps. Is the general economic environment in Serbia today conducive to development of small and medium-sized enterprises? To illustrate, is the restructuring and privatization of large public enterprises going at the right speed to enable setting up and development of small and medium-sized enterprises around those privatized and their integration into successful broader business programs? We can hardly give an affirmative reply to this question. It shall take time. Special credit lines and funds do represent a welcome initial trigger for the development of small and medium-sized enterprises, but they can neither be a permanent nor a systemic solution. It is not the role of the state to pick and choose from various funds and grant funds selectively to help resolve problems of certain categories of employees who were made redundant. The role of the state is to create a macroeconomic environment that shall be conducive to the development of small and medium-sized enterprises as an economic, not a social category. The real alternative for the future with respect to provision of credits to small and medium-sized enterprises namely, new business and new jobs, is to include banks on a broad scale in the process of market evaluation of projects and their financing at market determined terms. For its part, the NBS shall continue to create necessary conditions, primarily by securing stability in prices and low inflation, liberalization of the foreign exchange market and by further strengthening confidence in the dinar. The NBS shall secure conditions to enable everybody to plan their financial needs and business steps on a medium and long run without fear of drowning in the inflationary mud. 2 BIS Review 66/2007 
Randall S Kroszner: Encouraging responsible mortgage lending – prospective rulemaking initiatives  Remarks by Mr Randall S Kroszner, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the public hearing under the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (HOEPA), Federal Reserve Board, Washington DC, 14 June 2007. *      *      * I am pleased to be here today to chair the Federal Reserve Board's public hearing under the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (HOEPA). The hearing will focus specifically on how the Board might use its rulemaking authority under HOEPA to address concerns about abusive mortgage lending practices. In the course of this hearing, we will hear from key players in the home mortgage market: lenders, brokers, secondary market participants, consumer advocacy and community development organizations, academics and researchers, and state regulators. Although they play different roles, all share a common goal: encouraging responsible mortgage lending for the benefit of individual consumers and the American economy as a whole.  The Congress enacted HOEPA in 1994 in response to concerns about abusive lending in the home equity market, and the Federal Reserve Board was given broad authority to implement its provisions and to adopt regulations that the Board finds to be necessary and proper to effectuate its purposes. In addition, the Board has the responsibility to prohibit acts or practices it finds unfair or deceptive, or otherwise designed to evade HOEPA. The Board understands its rulemaking responsibility under HOEPA but is not alone in facing the important task of preventing unfair and deceptive practices. Other regulators share in our responsibility to ensure responsible mortgage lending through enforcement powers. The states have extensive regulatory authority – and responsibility – under their own anti-predatory lending statutes, various other relevant legal authorities, and especially their mortgage industry licensing acts – which give them considerable control over the activities of mortgage brokers and lenders. Many of the states, including notably those that are represented on this afternoon's panel, have been very active in reining in bad actors in their mortgage markets. The FTC also shares in our enforcement responsibilities under HOEPA and other federal laws. Finally, the other federal financial regulatory agencies each have a duty to enforce federal consumer protection laws, including HOEPA, with respect to the depository institutions under their respective supervisory ambits. In light of the sheer magnitude of the task, we are very pleased that these regulators all contribute to the goal of ensuring a healthy, competitive, and responsible mortgage market. We are committed to working closely with other federal and state regulators to ensure that the laws that protect consumers are enforced. HOEPA also directs the Board to hold hearings such as the one we hold today, to assess the effectiveness of regulations and laws in protecting consumers. Hearings provide us with valuable information. In our most recent prior hearings, held last summer in four cities around the country, our goals included assessing the effectiveness of our 2001 amendments to the HOEPA rules in curbing abusive lending practices while preserving access to credit. We also wanted to gather information on the effectiveness of the mortgage disclosures required by our Regulation Z, pursuant to the Truth in Lending Act, to inform our review of those disclosures, which is underway now.  Rising foreclosures in the subprime market over the past year have led the Board to consider whether and how it should use its rulemaking authority to address these concerns. In doing so, however, we must walk a fine line. We must determine how we can help to weed out abuses while also preserving incentives for responsible lenders. A robust and responsible subprime mortgage market benefits consumers by allowing borrowers with blemished or limited credit histories to become homeowners, access the equity in their homes, or have the flexibility to refinance their loans as needed. In this task we have several tools at our disposal. These include required disclosures by lenders, rules to prohibit abusive practices, principles-based guidance with supervisory oversight, less formal efforts to work with industry participants to promote best practices, and consumer education materials. The Federal Reserve currently is conducting a thorough review of its policies with respect to each of these tools. Last year, together with other federal banking regulators, we issued guidance concerning so-called nontraditional mortgages. We have also issued proposed supervisory guidance concerning underwriting standards and disclosures for subprime mortgages. The agencies are finishing their review of the comments received and expect to issue the final version soon. And the Federal Reserve BIS Review 66/2007 1 
produces a range of consumer education materials, including information to help potential borrowers understand adjustable-rate and other alternative mortgages, and we actively promote financial education by partnering with outside organizations.  The two tools that we will focus on today, however, are lender disclosures to consumers and rules that prohibit or restrict lending practices. Disclosures provide information that is critical to the effective functioning of markets. A core principle of economics is that markets are more competitive, and therefore more efficient, when accurate information is available to all participants. Information helps consumers by improving their ability to compare mortgage products and to choose those that will help them meet their personal goals.  We are keenly aware, however, of the substantial volume of disclosures and other documents that mortgage lending already entails, and we are sensitive to the risk that too much information may be of practically as little value to many consumers as no information at all. Accordingly, we intend to consider mortgage disclosures comprehensively, with an eye to improving their usefulness to consumers, while remaining mindful of the total burden for industry. Perhaps most importantly, we will engage in extensive consumer testing of mortgage disclosures, to ensure that disclosures provide information that consumers can readily use. Our goal is better disclosures, not necessarily more disclosures. We also recognize that disclosures may not always be sufficient to combat abusive practices. Because some bad lending practices may require additional measures, the Federal Reserve will seriously consider how we might use our rulemaking authority to address abusive practices without restricting consumers' access to beneficial financing options and responsible subprime credit. In addition to improved disclosures, regulations that restrict or prohibit practices that are "unfair or deceptive" may also be necessary. We have heard concerns about consumers being steered into mortgages they cannot afford and of repeated refinancings involving closing costs that strip away a borrower's home equity. Today, we will gather information on how we might craft rules to stop such abusive practices. We also will seek information from state officials regarding their experiences with drafting laws and rules to combat predatory lending efficiently and effectively. During today's hearing, we will seek information from panelists on certain specific questions. I would like to close by briefly touching on some of those. There are four terms or practices that have been most frequently cited as troublesome in the mortgage market, especially the subprime and home equity markets. They are:  • Prepayment penalties,  • Failure to require escrows for taxes and insurance,  • Stated income and low-documentation lending, and  • Failure to give adequate consideration to a borrower's ability to repay a loan.  At least some of these practices can be beneficial to at least some consumers. For example, an informed borrower might choose a loan with a prepayment penalty in exchange for a lower interest rate or lower closing costs. On the other hand, prepayment penalties also can be abusive, such as when a borrower is unaware that an adjustable rate mortgage loan has a substantial prepayment penalty that will extend beyond the first adjustment of the loan's interest rate, making it costly or impossible for the borrower to refinance the loan to avoid a higher interest rate and payment. We hope to gather information that helps us determine whether rules can prevent the abusive use of loan terms or practices while preserving their use in instances where they provide benefits to consumers. Giving adequate consideration to a borrower's ability to repay a loan obviously benefits both borrowers and lenders. Recently, the Board and the other federal financial regulatory agencies issued guidance reinforcing our collective belief that principles of prudent underwriting require consideration of a borrower's repayment ability. For example, the agencies have provided that lenders should qualify borrowers for nontraditional mortgage products such as interest-only loans and payment option adjustable-rate mortgage products based on a fully-indexed rate and fully amortizing payment. Some have urged the Board to adopt this broad principle as a rule, while others have urged the Board to preserve for lenders the flexibility to exercise their judgment in determining the likelihood that a given borrower can repay a loan. While it seems self-evident that adequate consideration of repayment ability is necessary, our experience in crafting the guidance taught us that this principle is far easier to articulate in general terms than in detailed, prescriptive rules stating which underwriting practices constitute "adequate" consideration. This is especially true in the context of mortgage credit 2 BIS Review 66/2007 
underwriting, which can depend on such a great number of pertinent, consumer-specific considerations. Today, with your help, we intend to explore in detail when these types of practices can be beneficial and when they might be problematic. We will seek informed suggestions with respect to the four practices I have identified, as well as any others that commenters may identify, in several regards. First, we ask whether such practices should be prohibited, restricted, or subjected to increased disclosure requirements, and if so, why. Second, we ask whether any new regulatory treatment of such practices should be limited to certain types of loans or certain types of borrowers, and if so, which types and why. Finally, we ask whether any state law provisions relating to such practices might serve as models for the Board to adopt at the federal level, and if so, what kind of record these state laws have in curbing abuses without restricting access to responsible mortgage credit. Your participation here today, and the wealth of pertinent information to be contributed by the panelists and others, are very much appreciated.  BIS Review 66/2007 3 
Timothy F Geithner: Asia, the world economy and the international financial system  Remarks by Mr Timothy F Geithner, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, at the Economic Society of Singapore 2007 Annual Dinner, Singapore, 13 June 2007. *      *      * Good evening. I am pleased to be able to join you tonight. The past decade has been one of remarkable achievement in Asia. This is a testament to the resilience and dynamism of this region, and yet the memories of the financial crises remain vivid and still exert a powerful influence on policy today. Tonight, I want to reflect on what policymakers learned from the crises, to review the extent of the progress since and to examine some of the challenges ahead.  The Asian financial crises of the late 1990s were exceptional in many respects. Described at the time by some as the first crises of the 21st century, they were commonly regarded as without precedent and fundamentally different from previous emerging market financial crises. Here were countries with a remarkable record of rapid economic growth over several decades, substantial rates of investment, with low inflation and relatively strong fiscal positions. Most conventional indicators of economic performance and financial strength did not suggest acute underlying vulnerability. Yet the crises erupted with remarkable speed and force. The sudden collapse of confidence led to a sharp reversal of capital flows to the region. On the eve of the crises, net capital inflows to the Asian crisis countries were equal to almost 6 percent of their GDP. Over the next two years, the flow of capital more than fully reversed. Income and output contracted abruptly: in the worst affected countries, GDP shrank by more than 10 percentage points from peak to trough and in one case, the contraction was closer to 15 percent. By any standards, these financial crises were unusually severe. The crises marked a sudden and dramatic break with the past, and brought a new sense of vulnerability to economies perceived as strong and successful. Yet though some of the characteristics of the Asian crises distinguished them from other episodes of financial turmoil, they shared several important features in common with crises in countries with modern, market-oriented financial systems. They were largely unanticipated. A rise in borrowing created vulnerability to a shift in asset prices. Uncertainty about the scale and nature of the underlying vulnerability magnified the problem. Contagion spread rapidly. Markets overshot. The fundamental economic and financial weaknesses that were the source of vulnerability were the consequence of the interaction between weak domestic financial systems, selective liberalization of controls on capital flows and fixed exchange rate regimes. Banking systems combined relatively weak supervision with broad government guarantees, some explicit, but more commonly implicit, reflecting a tradition of public sector intervention to protect troubled companies and banks from failure. Tax and regulatory incentives promoted short-term borrowing in foreign currency through the banking system. Capital inflows, largely through the banking system, helped finance a boom in investment and real estate. Distortions in the financial system led to a misallocation of resources so that high rates of private investment did not generate substantial improvements in productivity. Exchange rate regimes where the domestic currency was fixed to the dollar generated false expectations of stability, and the resulting increase in unhedged borrowing generated large exposures to changes in the exchange rate or interest rates. By 1997, the short-term external debt of the private sector had risen substantially, relative to GDP and to reserves, and this created conditions similar to a classic bank run, when the crises hit. The initial spark for the loss of confidence is still not fully clear, as is often the case in financial crises. And although the particular dynamics differed across the countries in the region, the basic pattern was common, with a rapid and sustained effort by domestic and foreign investors to reduce their exposure to further losses. The initial effects of this behavior made the exchange rate commitments untenable, and when those commitments were broken and currencies fell, the panic became self-reinforcing. Uncertainty and lack of information fed the run. Market participants were unable to judge whether deteriorating developments reflected temporary liquidity problems or deeper solvency issues. They BIS Review 65/2007 1 
reacted by assuming the worst. These shifts in market sentiment risked becoming self-validating, with liquidity problems transformed into solvency problems with broader risk of default. The capacity of policymakers to restore stability was constrained by the depth of the balance sheet problems. In some cases, where the scale of external borrowing was less acute, policymakers had more room to act. But in most cases, policy options were very limited. Initially, governments were reluctant to let exchange rates move too far, because of fears that this would force banks and companies that had borrowed in dollars or yen into default on a scale that could further damage growth. At the same time, the authorities were reluctant to tighten monetary policy as a way to help stabilize the exchange rate because of concern it would hurt growth and perhaps exacerbate the flight from domestic assets. This dilemma made the initial policy response in the crisis countries look halting and tentative. And, uncertainty about the strength and continuity of political leadership further hampered government efforts to recover credibility. In the countries hit hardest by the crisis, looming issues of succession and elections compounded the problem of confidence. The crises prompted a searching reassessment of the conventional economic wisdom and a new appreciation of the challenges that come with financial integration. The classic measures of macroeconomic stability and policy prudence, in fiscal positions and measured inflation rates, could mask substantial structural weaknesses, and these same structural weaknesses could ultimately undermine the achievements of otherwise reasonably conservative macroeconomic policy management. Partial capital account liberalization, which encouraged the accumulation of short-term debt obligations, brought substantial risk, magnifying weaknesses in domestic financial systems. Exchange rate commitments provided less stability than had been assumed. The rise in capital mobility increased exposure to shifts in sentiment. Markets could now adjust much faster than policy could typically react. These judgments precipitated major changes in policies and a sustained investment in improvements to the institutional framework of domestic financial systems across the region. And these changes in turn laid the foundation for recovery and for the very substantial improvements in economic and financial strength now evident across the region.  Achievements since the crises Although it took some time for policy to begin to restore confidence, recovery was stronger and more rapid than had been typical in other emerging market financial crises. Barely 18 months after the crisis, for example, Korean GDP had returned to pre-crisis levels, and this was true for all the Asian crisis countries by 2003. Growth has been relatively strong and stable since, though at a pace somewhat below the unsustainable rates of the decade prior to the crises. The balance sheets of the region have been transformed from weakness into strength. Current account balances are generally in surplus. External debt of the banking and corporate sector has fallen. Banking systems are now much less exposed to liabilities in foreign currencies; and the currency mismatches that made economies so vulnerable as the crises erupted have been greatly reduced. Official reserves have risen to levels without precedent in modern financial history. Fiscal positions have strengthened. After rising initially with the substantial costs associated with bank recapitalization programs, in recent years public debt ratios have generally been declining as a share of GDP. Monetary policy regimes have become more mature, with some progress toward greater de facto independence for central banks, with clearer mandates for price stability. Exchange rate regimes in the crisis countries have become somewhat more flexible, providing greater scope for monetary policy to sustain the domestic conditions for price stability. Financial systems are substantially stronger. Bank capital ratios now provide a significantly larger cushion against potential losses – though capital ratios in Asian banking sectors are still generally lower than those in other emerging economies. The quality of bank assets has improved. Non-performing loans, estimated to have peaked at between one-quarter and three-quarters of total loans in the crisis countries, are now under 10 percent of total loans. Financial institutions that required government intervention have largely been restored to private ownership. Domestic capital markets 2 BIS Review 65/2007 
are an increasingly important channel of intermediation in financial systems that had historically been dominated by banks. These are impressive achievements by any measure. And the changes that have taken place provide a strong foundation for future growth and they make it much less likely that these economies will be vulnerable to the type of crises of a decade ago. This progress is reflected in a broad range of financial market indicators of risk. Risk premia in domestic interest rates markets are low. Spreads on remaining dollar-denominated debt have fallen to levels that reflect little concern about future financial stress. It is important to bear in mind that some of the most dramatic changes in the performance of Asian and other emerging market economies have taken place in an unusually benign economic environment. The past four years have marked the strongest sustained period of growth for several decades. Global interest rates have been relatively low. Asset prices in many markets have been rising for a sustained period of time. Volatility in equity, interest rate and foreign exchange markets has fallen to unusually low levels, and although we’ve seen the occasional sharp correction in some markets, recovery has typically been quick. These favorable conditions make everything look somewhat better than it otherwise would. But the improvements in Asia are real, and they will make the region more resilient in the face of future challenges. The challenges ahead Even with the relative prosperity of the recent past, policy in much of the region reflects substantial ambivalence about the risks that come with financial openness. The memory of the trauma of the crisis explains much of this ambivalence. The difficulties in managing this more recent period of substantial capital inflows provides an additional source of unease. Policy regimes across the region are to a significant degree directed at providing some insulation for the domestic economy from what is considered a volatile global financial environment. This impulse reflects itself in many different ways. It is manifested in exchange rate regimes that still permit relatively limited variability against the dollar. It is manifested in the extent of reserve accumulation, in part the consequence of resistance to exchange rate appreciation. And it is manifested in the remaining controls on capital movements and the occasional experimentation with the introduction of new controls. The search for durable insurance against future volatility is an understandable response to the searing experience of the crises of a decade ago. But there is risk in this as well. And the incomplete embrace of integration could contain the seeds of future vulnerability. In this sense, the policy agenda needs to move from a focus on creating stronger defenses against crisis to building a greater ability to adapt to change. This requires strong institutions for the management of macroeconomic policy so that the monetary and fiscal policies are able to respond to shocks in a credible manner. It requires strong financial institutions with a substantial capacity to absorb losses and cope with volatility. It requires regulatory policies that encourage competition and innovation, with strong protections for property rights, low barriers to entry and effective financial supervision. And it requires investments in a nation’s human capital, in education, healthcare and pension provision. This complement of policies improves the prospects for producing the mix of flexibility and resilience necessary for sustained growth in a more integrated world economy. In emerging Asia, two key areas where there is the need and opportunity for further progress are in the financial system and in the monetary policy framework. The financial sector plays an important role in the flexibility and adaptability of economies to change, in the resilience of economies and in the capacity of the monetary authorities to respond to adverse shocks to asset prices or demand. Although much has been achieved in Asia over the past decade, as the damage inflicted by the crises has been repaired, further reform will be important to the capacity of these economies to innovate and grow and to live more comfortably with openness to capital flows. This requires stronger banks and more developed capital markets. Thus far, we have seen more progress on the former than the latter, but both are important and there remains considerable scope for broadening and deepening capital markets in emerging Asia. The extent of financial innovation in the industrial economies makes it possible for Asian countries to take advantage of huge BIS Review 65/2007 3 
improvements in the efficiency of financial intermediation. Embrace of these reforms will help ensure that high levels of domestic savings are deployed more efficiently, that companies and financial institutions are able to manage risks more effectively and that the financial system is more resilient in the face of future stress. Monetary policy regimes in much of Asia are burdened by two different types of constraints on independence. The first relates to the institutional relationship between the central bank and the government and the second to the multiple objectives assigned to the central banks. All the evidence points to improved long-term inflation performance when monetary policymakers are freed from institutional constraints that hamper their freedom of maneuver and given full operational independence. Such independence is best achieved by enshrining it in an institutional framework that provides for legal independence from the government, with accountability for achieving a clearly defined mandate focused on price stability. Few Asian central banks yet enjoy full legal independence, though most now have greater de facto independence than they once had. Fixed, or partially fixed exchange rate regimes, of course, also constrain the independence of monetary policy. As capital accounts become progressively more open, few countries can sustain over time a commitment to exchange rate stability without risking price stability. Eventually central banks will run up against limits on their capacity to sterilize the effects of exchange market intervention designed to limit the pace and extent of appreciation of the exchange rate. Although measured inflation in emerging Asian economies remains relatively low, the pace of credit growth and the behavior of asset prices provide some evidence of a growing tension among competing objectives. The longer this policy conflict persists, the greater the distortions building up in the economy, the greater the risk of future inflation and the greater the risk of a bumpy future. Reserves in emerging Asia recently passed the $2.5 trillion mark, double their size at the end of 2003. Given the levels that have been reached in many countries, it may no longer be appropriate to view rising reserves as a source of increasing strength against future volatility. They are, increasingly, signs of the allocative distortions that result from the exchange rate regime. And they are in a sense too much of a good thing. Conclusion The economic and financial transformation of the crisis economies has been extraordinary. The policy reforms adopted in the wake of the crises have made those economies less vulnerable and more resilient. And these changes justify substantial confidence about Asia’s economic future. Asia’s success fundamentally changes the international economic and financial system. It is no longer tenable to view the world as divided between a dominant core of mature industrial economies and a smaller periphery of emerging economies. Asia is now so closely integrated with the rest of the world, so large in relative terms, and growing so rapidly that the policy choices made in this region will have a much greater impact on the rest of the world. And it means that Asia will need to prepare for a future in which it relies more on the strength of growth at home rather than on the strength of growth in the rest of the world. As Asia makes further progress in financial reform and toward more flexible exchange rate regimes, it will be in a better position both to deal with the inevitable challenges that come with economic and financial integration, and to make the necessary transition to stronger domestic demand led-growth, which will prove a more sustainable foundation for future improvements in living standards.

Ben S Bernanke: Education and economic competitiveness Remarks by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the US Chamber Education and Workforce Summit, Washington DC, 24 September 2007. The original speech, which contains various links to the documents mentioned, can be found on the US Federal Reserve System’s website.  *      *      * When I travel around the country, meeting with students, business people, and others interested in the economy, I am occasionally asked for investment advice. Usually (though not always) the question is posed in jest. No one really expects me to tell them which three stocks they should buy. However, I know the answer to the question and I will share it with you today: Education is the best investment.  Here at the U.S. Chamber Education and Workforce Summit, I don’t really need to convince you that, as an investment, education provides excellent returns, both for individuals and for society. As executives accustomed to making hard cost-benefit decisions, you doubtless assign a high priority to the quality of your business’s workforce because you know that a key – perhaps the key – to your success is the capabilities of the people you employ. To a significant extent, those capabilities are the product of education. Here I am speaking not just of education acquired formally in classrooms before entering the workforce but also of lifelong learning that, yes, includes the formal classroom training that might first come to mind but that also includes early childhood programs, informal mentoring on the job, and mid-career retraining, to name a few examples. And when I speak of capabilities, I mean not only the knowledge derived from education but also the values, skills, and personal traits acquired through education, which are as important as, and sometimes even more important than, the specific knowledge obtained. These include such qualities as the ability to think critically, to communicate clearly and logically, and to see a project through from start to finish. Today, I would like to offer a broad overview of education and its importance to our economy from my perspective not only as an economist but also as a one-time school board member, the spouse of a teacher, and the parent of two young adults pursuing higher education. Although the United States has long been a world leader in expanding educational opportunities, we have also long grappled with challenges, such as troubling high-school dropout rates, particularly for minority and immigrant youths, and frustratingly slow and uneven progress in raising test scores and other measures of educational achievement. If we are to make progress in meeting these challenges, we must be willing to actively debate their causes and continually experiment and innovate to find solutions. The benefits of education Education imparts significant benefits both to our society and the individuals who pursue it. Economists have long recognized that the skills of the workforce are an important source of economic growth. Moreover, as the increase over time in the returns to education and skill is likely the single greatest cause of the long-term rise in economic inequality, policies that lead to broad investments in education and training can help reduce inequality while expanding economic opportunity (Bernanke, 2007). But the benefits of education are more than economic. A substantial body of evidence demonstrates that more-highly-educated individuals are happier on average, make better personal financial decisions, suffer fewer spells of unemployment, and enjoy better health. Benefiting society as a whole, educated individuals are more likely to participate in civic affairs, volunteer their time to charities, and subscribe to personal values – such as tolerance and an appreciation of cultural differences BIS Review 106/2007 1 
– that are increasingly crucial for the healthy functioning of our diverse society (Glaeser, Ponzetto, and Shleifer, 2006; Dee, 2004). From a macroeconomic standpoint, education is important because it is so directly linked to productivity, which, in turn, is the critical determinant of the overall standard of living. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that, between 1987 and 2006, ongoing improvement in the education and experience of the U.S. workforce contributed 0.4 percentage point per year to the increase in nonfarm business labor productivity (U.S. Department of Labor, 2007), a significant amount. These estimates are however conservative in that they hold fixed other sources of productivity growth, such as the accumulation of various forms of capital and the advance of technology; but workers’ skills certainly contribute indirectly to productivity growth by affecting these other factors as well. For example, the state of technology is affected both by the creativity and knowledge of scientists and engineers engaged in formal research and development as well as by the efforts of skilled workers on the shop floor who find more efficient ways to accomplish a given task. Managers who develop a new business plan or find new ways to use evolving technologies can also be thought of as adding to the “intangible,” or knowledge-based, capital of the firm, which by some estimates is comparable in importance to physical capital such as factories and equipment (Corrado, Hulten, and Sichel, 2006). For individuals, the economic returns to education are substantial as well. In 2006, the median weekly earnings of college graduates were 75 percent higher than the earnings of high-school graduates. In turn, workers with a high-school degree earned 42 percent more than those without any diploma.1 These differentials are large and have been growing; indeed, they have roughly doubled in the past twenty-five years or so. The source of the widening wage gap between the more-educated and less-educated is nothing more complicated than supply and demand. The demand for more-educated workers has been increasing rapidly, partly because the much more widespread use of computers and other sophisticated information and communication technologies in the workplace has increased the reward for technical skills. The supply of highly educated workers has also risen. At the start of the 1980s, 22 percent of young adults aged 25 to 29 held a college degree or more; by last year, that fraction had moved up to 28.5 percent.2 Nevertheless, the supply of educated workers has not kept pace with demand, thus generating an increased salary premium for education. Because the wages of those at the top of the educational ladder have increased the fastest, increasing our investment in education can benefit not only individuals and society but also might narrow income gaps. Education and the challenges facing America today The educational challenges our society faces should be considered in the context of three broad trends: the retirement of the baby-boom generation, the inexorable advance of the technological frontier, and the ongoing globalization of economic activity. As the baby boomers, now ranging in age from their late 40s to early 60s, leave the workforce, their places will be taken by the smaller cohort of workers born in the mid-to-late 1960s and early 1970s. As a result, the U.S. workforce – as a matter of simple arithmetic – will increase more slowly and is likely to become less experienced on average (Jorgenson and others, 2007; Aaronson and Sullivan, 2002). In a broader sense, the ratio of working people to retirees will decline, meaning that those still working will, in effect, be supporting relatively more non-working people. This year, there are about five working-age people (20-                                                 1  The data are weekly earnings of full-time wage and salary workers aged twenty-five and older and are derived from the Current Population Survey, published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. 2  The data are derived from the Current Population Survey, published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. 2 BIS Review 106/2007 
64) for every person aged 65 and older; by 2030, the ratio will be about 3-to-1 (Bernanke, 2006). The slower expansion of the labor force, all else equal, implies slower growth of potential output. More schooling for more of the workforce could help cushion the impact of this demographic transition on economic growth by boosting productivity growth. Continuing advances in technology also put a premium on education. Which jobs will be most affected by technology is difficult to predict, although some research suggests that sectors that now use information technology (IT) relatively less intensively, such as health-care and other service sectors, are likely to step up their use of software and IT services (Mann, 2003). Regardless, better-educated workers are likely better prepared to adapt to new technologies as they develop (Doms, Dunne, and Troske, 1997). Ongoing globalization of economic activity will also lead to continuing changes in the structure of the U.S. economy – including the composition of our output of both goods and services, and thus the structure of our labor force. The world economy is benefiting from the expansion of trade and the rising productivity of countries abroad that are making great strides expanding both their infrastructure and the educational attainment of their workforces. That can be good for them, and for us. Importantly, our ability to reap the benefits of globalization will depend on the flexibility of our labor force to adapt to changes in job opportunities, in part by investing in the education and training necessary to meet the new demands (Bernanke, 2004). Educational attainment and achievement: where do we stand? The United States has a long tradition of recognizing the significant social and economic benefits of providing high-quality education for as many of its citizens as possible. The United States led the world, first, in expanding access to high-school education and, then, in the post-World War II era, access to college (Goldin, 2001; Goldin and Katz, 1999). By 1966, about half of the workforce aged 25 and older had completed high school and about 10 percent had completed college. By 2006, more than 90 percent of adults in the labor force had a high-school education and more than 20 percent held at least a bachelor’s degree. However, most of the progress over the past forty years occurred in the 1970s and early 1980s. Since then, for example, the high-school graduation rate for 25-to-29-year-olds has not increased, and the college completion rate has risen only modestly (U.S. Department of Education, 2007b). One trend is particularly disappointing: Both high-school and college completion rates for minorities continue to lag.3 Over the past ten years, the high-school completion rate for whites aged 25 to 29 hovered above 93 percent, while the rate for blacks of the same age stayed near 87 percent; the rate for Hispanics, though trending up over the period, was only 63 percent last year. The gaps in college completion are wider. In recent years, more than one-third of whites aged 25 to 29 had at least a bachelor’s degree, compared with less than one-fifth of same-aged blacks and around 10 percent of Hispanics. Assessing where we stand in terms of educational achievement (how much students learn) is fraught with considerably greater difficulties than assessing attainment (how far students progress in their schooling). And, the results of various metrics highlight both discouraging and encouraging elements. The Department of Education’s National Assessment of Educational Progress shows the average reading levels of our high-school seniors have stagnated in recent years; however, our fourth graders continue to improve in reading, and both fourth and eighth graders have improved in math (U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, 2007b). At the same time, some initial results from                                                  3  The data are derived from the Current Population Survey, March and Annual Social and Economic Supplement, 1971-2006, published by the U.S. Department of Commerce. BIS Review 106/2007 3 
the adoption of state accountability standards suggest that they have had a positive effect on students’ test-score gains (Jacob, 2005; Hanushek and Raymond, 2004). International comparisons of student achievement are even more difficult and present a mixed picture.4 Compared with students around the world, U.S. students still perform relatively well in reading and, in the lower grades, at math and science. Older U.S. students, however, show less ability to apply math and science skills than their peers in other industrialized countries. Lifelong learning can help us meet economic challenges In the past, the U.S. education system has responded to the needs of a changing economy, and I believe that as we address such challenges as the retirement of the baby-boom generation, advancing technology, and globalization, our education system will again make an important contribution to the adjustment process. That means, of course, that we will have to grapple with difficult issues – how to boost educational attainment, particularly for minorities and immigrant youths; how to make more consistent and noticeable progress in raising academic achievement; and how to ensure that older workers have meaningful opportunities to refresh their skills. What can be done so that our educational system will continue to play a significant role in supporting economic change? In broad terms, we must begin by recognizing that learning is a lifelong process and that we have opportunities to improve education at every point along the way. Many of these opportunities lie outside the traditional route of a kindergarten-through-twelfth-grade education followed by four years of college. I’d like to comment briefly on what economists have found about the benefits of educational investments at different points in the life cycle. Early childhood education Building the foundation for lifelong learning from the earliest ages is crucial (Heckman, Stixrud, and Urzua, 2006). Research suggests that the home environment is especially important and that children who start behind find catching up increasingly difficult (Heckman and Masterov, 2007). Thus, the payoff from high-quality pre-school and home visitation programs is likely very high, especially for children born into poor or otherwise disadvantaged families. Recent research – some sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis in collaboration with the University of Minnesota – has documented high returns from early childhood programs in terms of subsequent educational attainment and in lower rates of social problems, such as crime, teenage pregnancy, and welfare dependency (Burr and Grunewald, 2006).5 But early childhood education is only the beginning. Positive results from programs such as Head Start dissipate without further high-quality schooling at the elementary and secondary levels (Garces, Thomas, and Currie, 2002). Elementary and secondary schooling Deciding what and how to teach students from kindergarten through high school and then evaluating our schools’ effectiveness in preparing students for the workforce and a lifetime of                                                  4  The results of two prominent international assessments – The Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, conducted under the aegis of the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement, and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s Program for International Student Assessment – are summarized in the 2006 Digest of Education Statistics published by the U.S. Department of Education (2007a). http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d06/ch_6.asp 5  More information on the Early Childhood Research Collaborative and copies of its research papers can be obtained from the website of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, www.earlychildhoodrc.org. 4 BIS Review 106/2007 
learning is a daunting task. I will make only a few observations on the goals we should keep in mind as we explore ways to improve learning at the elementary and secondary levels.  First, we should encourage experimentation and innovation. By my reading, the research on K-12 education has, to date, yielded no easy answers to the questions of how to raise academic achievement and how to ensure that students finish high school well prepared to move on to more advanced study. A wide range of approaches has been and is being explored: smaller class size, school choice, charter school programs, accountability standards, flexibility in teacher certification rules, better teacher pay, merit-based pay, year-round schooling – the list is long and probably will get longer. The size and diversity of our country, together with the fact that state and local policymakers retain significant discretion over how to structure their educational systems, provides us a natural laboratory for assessing the effectiveness of alternative educational strategies. I view the debate about what works and what doesn’t to be a crucial part of discovering cost-effective ways to improve our educational system. The business community has an obvious interest in how well our schools prepare students for a future in the workforce and should actively participate in the debate. But we all have a stake. Students at the elementary and secondary levels are being prepared not just for work but for life. Such skills and acquired traits as critical and creative thinking, social ability, persistence, and satisfaction in accomplishment make not only good employees but good citizens as well. Exposure to the arts and culture and experience in serving the community can help support the development of these broader, harder-to-measure skills, alongside more readily measurable cognitive accomplishments in reading, math, and science.  Second, teacher quality is critical. Studies show that student performance depends on putting high-quality teachers in the classroom and retaining them as long as possible (Aaronson, Barrow, and Sander, 2007; Rivkin, Hanushek, and Kain, 2005; Rockoff, 2004). Indeed, many initiatives focus on linking students, especially disadvantaged students, with high-quality schools staffed by high-quality teachers. High-quality teachers instill in their young students a desire to stay in school and seek more education later in life, and the evidence suggests that the quality of teaching might have the biggest impact on lower-ability students (Murnane and Steele, 2007; Clotfelter and others, 2006; Hanushek, Kain, and Rivkin, 2004). Unfortunately, our most disadvantaged communities, the ones most troubled by high dropout rates, have difficulty attracting and keeping qualified teachers. We must instill a desire among students to stay in school and to seek more education and training over their working lives. Our elementary and secondary schools must provide students a strong foundation for a life of learning. Although a wide range of remedial education programs exist, research suggests that they are more costly and less effective than a solid, sustained course of study through high school. In particular, government training programs for disadvantaged youth have a rather disappointing reputation, particularly those that are less intensive and not well tied to labor market needs (Martin and Grubb, 2001; Heckman, LaLonde, and Smith, 1999).  A number of possibilities for improving the education of disadvantaged students seem worth exploring. For example, several experiments suggest that smaller schools and smaller classes may help disadvantaged students (although the benefits of such programs for the general student population remain controversial). Supplemental education, including after-school and mentoring programs such as Big Brothers Big Sisters, have been shown to boost school attendance (Grossman and Tierney, 1998). Increasing school time – either through longer school hours or summer school – also has found some support (Jacob and Lefgren, 2004).  Higher education In many ways, higher education represents the strongest part of the U.S. educational system, as demonstrated by the fact that students from all parts of the world come here to BIS Review 106/2007 5 
study. Our institutions of higher learning are extraordinarily varied, ranging from large public research universities to small liberal arts colleges to community colleges and vocational schools. The main business of our institutions of higher education is, of course, undergraduate teaching. But unlike some countries, we do not separate research and undergraduate education; our advanced, graduate-level research programs are housed in universities with strong undergraduate programs. Thus, our colleges and universities are important sources of research and development (National Science Foundation, 2007; Litan, Mitchell, and Reedy, forthcoming). More than half our basic research – the foundation for breakthroughs that create new industries – is conducted at universities. Additionally, higher education has embraced the broader mission of translating research into new products and enterprises; our colleges and universities account for 15 percent of applied research and development (National Science Foundation, 2007). The innovations that begin on campuses are diffused to businesses through patents, start-up companies, and consulting arrangements between faculty and industry. One great challenge in higher education lies in making sure our high-school graduates are prepared for it and have access to it. With college enrollment rates having leveled off in recent years, much debate surrounds how we can move more students into higher education and keep them in school until they graduate. Researchers have demonstrated a strong relationship between family income and college attendance. Since 1990, nearly 80 percent of high-school completers from high-income families (the top 20 percent of income) have enrolled in college the next fall. The proportion of those from low-income families who enroll in college the following fall has been moving up gradually, but it remains much lower – just over 50 percent.6 This discrepancy holds even for students classified as high achievers: A longitudinal study of eighth graders in 1988 found that only 29 percent of those scoring in the top fourth of the group in math – but who were from families with low social and economic status – had completed a bachelor’s degree or more by 2000, while three-fourths of those from families with high social and economic status finished their undergraduate degrees (Fox, Connelly, and Snyder, 2005).7 Surely, high tuition must be one barrier to attending and completing college (Card, 2001; Kane, 1994), but it is not the only barrier (Dynarski, 2005). Low-income students, in particular, are more likely to come from school and family environments that do a poor job of preparing them for a successful transition to college (Carneiro and Heckman, 2003). This suggests that supplemental programs to help under-prepared college students could improve eventual college completion rates; unfortunately, the research on the benefits of such programs is mixed, which reinforces the need to improve educational achievement in regular high school classes (Bettinger and Long, 2005; Angrist, Lang, and Oreopoulos, 2006). Community colleges have made a significant contribution to expanding educational opportunities. Offering lower costs and more-flexible schedules, they now enroll almost one-half of U.S. undergraduates. Attendance at one of these institutions is associated with higher wages, even if a degree is not completed. Evidence suggests that each year of credit at a community college is worth almost as much, in terms of increased earnings potential, as a year at a four-year college. The average student who entered, but did not complete, community college earns 9 percent to 13 percent more than the average for students who                                                  6  These data are derived from the annual October Supplement to the Current Population Survey. They are summarized in the U.S. Department of Education’s Condition of Education 2007 available at http://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/2007/section3/indicator 25.asp#info. 7  Socioeconomic status was measured by a composite score on parental education and occupations and family income. The study also found that the proportion of low-scoring math students from high socioeconomic families who completed at least a bachelor’s degree was 30 percent versus only 3 percent for those from lower socioeconomic families. For those in the middle quintiles of both scores and family characteristics, the proportion was 21 percent. 6 BIS Review 106/2007 
ended their education with high school. Those who completed a two-year associate degree earn an even larger premium, 15 percent to 27 percent (Kane and Rouse, 1999). And the earnings of graduates who started at two-year schools and transferred to four-year programs ultimately match those who begin their post-high-school education at four-year institutions (Gill and Leigh, 2003). Community colleges play a constructive role not only for 18-to-22-year-olds but also for older adults, providing flexible programs for obtaining new skills, specialized training contracted for by individual businesses, remedial education, and adult enrichment. Adult education Today we are increasingly recognizing that education need not, indeed should not, stop at the age of 22. Economists have long argued that on-the-job training and learning-by-doing are significant components of the acquisition of human capital. Research shows that the knowledge and experience gained over time through informal and formal learning on the job appear to pay off for workers and accrues particularly rapidly early in their careers (Altonji and Williams, 2005; Topel, 1991). An extensive survey of firm-sponsored training a number of years ago found that 84 percent of employees received some kind of formal training while working for their current employer, and 96 percent received some type of informal training (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1996). With the advance of technology and the need to attract and retain skilled workers, I am certain that business-sponsored training will remain an important component of the management toolkit. Upgrading skills through continuing education and training outside the job is also important, particularly in an environment in which workers can face displacement from international competition or technological advance. Recognizing this possibility, many workers continue to acquire formal education later in life than was once traditional. For example, almost one-fifth of students at post-secondary institutions of all types are at least 35 years old (National Center for Education Statistics, 2007a). And, for older workers looking to retool their skills, classroom instruction has been shown to be effective. For example, classroom training for displaced workers is estimated to boost future wages as much as for students of the usual school age, although the overall return on investment for displaced workers is lower because they have fewer remaining working years than do new entrants to the labor force (Jacobsen, LaLonde, Sullivan, 2005). Similarly, studies of a number of welfare-to-work programs have reported long-term gains for those who participated in intensive basic education and vocational training (Dyke and others, 2006; Hotz, Imbens, Klerman, 2006). Such results suggest that well-designed programs to assist workers who lose their jobs can contribute to cushioning the effects of globalization and technological change. Conclusion Let me close by reiterating that education – lifelong education for everyone, from toddlers to workers well advanced in their careers – is indeed an excellent investment for individuals and society as a whole. Education fundamentally supports advances in productivity, upon which our ability to generate continuing improvement in our standard of living depends. If we are to successfully navigate such challenges as the retirement of the baby-boom generation, advancing technology, and increasing globalization, we must work diligently to maintain the quality of our educational system where it is strong and strive to improve it where it is not. In particular, we must find ways to move more of our students, especially minorities and students from disadvantaged backgrounds, into educational opportunities after high school. To do that, we must continually experiment, innovate, and evaluate so that we can make rational decisions about what works and what doesn’t in education. Because the quality of your workforces is so vital to the success of your businesses, you as business executives must participate fully in this process, along with other stakeholders – students, parents, BIS Review 106/2007 7 
teachers, and policymakers. I’m encouraged that you are devoting so much energy and thought to this topic at this three-day conference.

David Dodge: Turbulence in credit markets – causes, effects, and lessons to be learned Remarks by Mr David Dodge, Governor of the Bank of Canada, to the Vancouver Board of Trade, Vancouver, 25 September 2007. *      *      * I'm very happy to be back in Vancouver and to have the opportunity to address the Board of Trade for the fourth and final time in my capacity as Governor. When considering a topic for today, I had planned to use the quiet moments of the summer to organize my thoughts about the evolution of the Canadian and global economies since 2001, and offer some ideas about the lessons that could be learned from the events of the past seven years.  Unfortunately, as many of us here well know, this past summer was rather short on quiet moments. In August, the attention of policy-makers and the business community in general was focused on some fairly serious turbulence in financial markets. And so, rather than using my speech today to look back over the past seven years, I will instead look back over the past seven weeks and review what has taken place in global and Canadian financial markets. Of course, events are still unfolding and will likely continue to evolve for some time. Still, it's not too early to discuss some of the causes and effects of the market turbulence and, along the way, identify some of the lessons to be learned from these events. I will also talk about the actions that the Bank of Canada took in response. I'll then have a few words to say about the potential impact of the market turbulence on the outlook for the Canadian economy. Turbulence: causes and effects To get a grasp on the events of the summer, it's important to have some context. The turbulence in financial markets did not come about against a backdrop of economic weakness. Indeed, over the past number of years, the global economy has shown remarkable strength. We were also seeing encouraging signs of growth being spread more evenly. At the same time, there was continued robust demand for Canadian goods and services, and this led to a significant improvement in Canada's terms of trade, helping to support the Canadian dollar. But there were signs of potential trouble in the global economy. To begin with, we were seeing a growing excess of desired global savings relative to desired investment. Quite naturally, this served to drive down real longer-term interest rates, even as central banks around the world were in the process of raising short-term policy rates. With the decline in longer-term interest rates, investors stepped up their demand for riskier assets that would deliver greater returns than investments with a lower risk. This search for yield led to a narrowing of spreads between the yields of risky assets, such as lower-rated corporate bonds, and the yields on government bonds. The narrowing of risky spreads became so pronounced and so persistent that many central banks – including the Bank of Canada – began to question whether these spreads adequately reflected the credit risks that were involved. A re-pricing of risk was probably necessary, but the real question was how, and in what manner, it would take place.  Besides the need for a re-pricing of risk, other factors contributed to the market turbulence this summer. Originators of loans – both bank and non-bank institutions – were increasingly opting to securitize the loans they made, including U.S. subprime mortgage loans. By "securitize," I mean to bundle loans together into securities backed by the cash flows generated by the loan repayments. These securities were often sold in tranches that offered varying degrees of protection from the default risk involved. These structures allowed higher-BIS Review 106/2007 1 
risk assets to take on the qualities of lower-risk assets, and this fuelled the demand for the creation of higher-risk assets, which led to a global decline in standards for mortgage loans and the emergence of bonds with weaker covenants. Further, some of these assets embedded significant leverage. The originators of these loans had fewer incentives to carefully assess the creditworthiness of borrowers, because once the loan had been securitized and sold, the originator no longer faced the consequence if the borrower defaulted. I'll return to this point a bit later. But for now, suffice it to say that this decline in lending standards, combined with financial engineering, was helping to spur merger and acquisition activity, including private-equity takeovers, as well as lending in markets such as the U.S. subprime mortgage market. The process of securitization is not new. Securities backed by mortgages, credit card receivables, or other types of assets, have been around for years. But increasingly complex securities have been developed in response to the demand for higher returns. And as these securities have become more complex and opaque, in many cases it has become harder to determine the quality of the assets at the root of the security and to assess the counterparty risk. This is not to suggest that the evolution of these new, complex instruments has been a negative development. Indeed, these instruments have allowed the separation of different types of risk, such as credit and market risk. This has promoted better risk-management practices, and has allowed different types of risk to be borne by those best able to do so. Securitization has encouraged innovation and enhanced the ability of the banking sector to originate new loans while remaining well capitalized. The final point to make in terms of the causes of this summer's turbulence has to do with how these complex securities are valued. Trading of these securities in the secondary market is rare and, if trading does occur, it takes place in the over-the-counter market. As such, prices for these securities are not very transparent. Most of these highly structured securities are valued on a "marked-to-model" basis, meaning that statistical models are used to provide values. But the models typically provide only estimates of values, and these estimates can vary widely if there are changes in the assumptions on which they are based. Indeed, many of the models assume that the assets underlying these securities can be readily traded in a liquid secondary market. In August, it became clear that this assumption would not always hold.  So, we can now see many of the factors that made credit markets vulnerable to this summer's dislocations. The re-pricing of risk I mentioned earlier was, in fact, under way before August. By late spring, the spreads on lower-rated corporate bonds had begun to widen to levels that were closer to historical averages. As we moved into summer, however, we saw rising delinquency rates and higher probabilities of default on U.S. subprime mortgages. And so, there were rising expectations of losses for holders of securities backed by these mortgages. But because of the complexity and opacity of some of these securities, it was extremely difficult for investors to determine, with confidence, both the creditworthiness of the assets backing a particular security and the market value of the security itself. In these circumstances, uncertainty led to contagion and dislocations in money markets more generally, even those markets that have nothing to do with U.S. subprime mortgages. Market liquidity, which was recently thought to be too abundant, became scarce. Some investors found that the assets that they assumed were liquid were, in fact, frozen. Even the market for overnight loans was affected. Investors suddenly became extremely risk averse, leading to a surge in demand for the least risky assets, such as government bonds and treasury bills. The re-pricing of credit risk is an ongoing process, and the events of this summer represent a bump in the road. Unfortunately, that bump means that it may take a while to achieve an appropriate pricing of risk. This is because it will take time to unravel some of these complex and opaque instruments to get to the underlying assets, and then to find values for the 2 BIS Review 106/2007 
assets themselves. Over time, market forces can be expected to work this out. But markets need information in order to operate efficiently. So, it is in the interest of market participants to make sure that parties have access to all the necessary information. This is the first lesson to be learned – the importance of transparency in financial markets. Two weeks ago in London, I spoke about how the events of the summer helped to make a clear case for transparency. Investors should demand greater transparency where it is now lacking. Vendors of financial instruments will then need to structure them in such a way that market players can clearly see what they are buying. More fundamentally, investors must take on more responsibility for diligent research, so that they can better understand the nature of their investments. Put another way, investors must do their own homework instead of simply relying on the word of credit-rating agencies. It seems to me that many of these desired outcomes will be accomplished through natural market forces responding to these events. For example, when investors demand much higher rates of return for opaque products, there will be a strong incentive for vendors to provide products that are more transparent. Similarly, credit-rating agencies will likely find it to their advantage to explain more clearly the rationale for, and limitations of, their ratings for highly structured products. They should make it clear that their ratings should not be used with the same degree of certainty as ratings for conventional, single-name issuers, and that the securities involved do not trade with the same degree of market liquidity. There will undoubtedly be calls for tighter government regulation for credit-rating agencies. But I would caution against any knee-jerk regulatory response. Given the events of the summer, it seems likely that those credit-rating agencies that do not work harder to ensure that users understand the nature of their ratings will soon have fewer clients willing to pay for their services. There is one other lesson I want to mention at this point. We need to think about how to get the right incentives in place for loan originators, so that credit quality is maintained and credit is appropriately priced. As I mentioned earlier, the creation of loans for immediate securitization reduced the incentive for originators to maintain credit standards. This indicates a classic principal-agent problem: Since the originators were immune from default risk once the loan was securitized and sold, they often lacked the proper incentives to adequately assess the creditworthiness of the borrower. We need to think hard about how to get the incentives right. It may be that natural market forces will go a long way towards rebalancing incentives, but there may also be an active role for policy-makers in this regard. Another issue related to securitization concerns the capitalization of banks. If banks are moving securitized loans off their balance sheets, but still providing liquidity guarantees for these securities, how much capital should they be required to set aside? The authorities at the Basel Committee may need to revisit this issue in light of recent experiences.  This summer's turbulence had an effect on many segments of the money markets, including the market for overnight funds. The overnight market is now well on its way back to normal operations in Canada, and I'll talk about that in a few minutes when I discuss the role of the central bank. However, problems in other areas of the money markets have not yet been resolved. In terms of the market for asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP), about two-thirds of Canada's roughly $120 billion ABCP market is composed of conduits sponsored by our major domestic banks. These banks have agreed to provide global-style liquidity support to their conduits, and investors have every reason to be confident that our banks have the capacity to continue to support their conduits as necessary. Although the spreads between bank-sponsored ABCP and treasury bills have narrowed a bit in recent days, it is somewhat surprising that they have not narrowed further and more quickly, given the strong balance sheets of Canadian banks. The remainder of Canada's ABCP is third-party, or non-bank-sponsored, and roughly three-quarters of this is highly structured. Because liquidity for this paper was guaranteed only in the event of a "general market disruption," liquidity providers – most of whom are BIS Review 106/2007 3 
international banks – declined to step in as this paper has come due. Thus a fundamental work-out, or restructuring, of third-party ABCP is required. Discussions in Montréal between investors and liquidity providers as to how to achieve such a restructuring are progressing. I would encourage the parties involved to support this process – all investors and all international banks. I remain hopeful that, over time, this process will lead to useful results. The role of the central bank Now let me talk about the actions of the Bank of Canada over the past seven weeks. Essentially, our actions helped us fulfill two fundamental roles of a central bank – providing liquidity to the payments system, and formulating monetary policy. In terms of the first role, it is absolutely normal and proper that central banks should provide liquidity to the payments system, especially when financial institutions are faced with markets that have become illiquid. This is precisely the situation in which we found ourselves this summer. With money markets seizing up, many institutions found it difficult to obtain necessary liquidity. So the Bank of Canada, like other central banks, made it clear that institutions could access our regular liquidity facility when required. The Bank of Canada's Standing Liquidity Facility can be accessed daily, at a rate 25 basis points above our target for the overnight rate, by direct clearers involved in Canada's wholesale payments system. To access this liquidity, institutions can pledge a range of easily priced securities as collateral.  The events in August placed strong upward pressure on the overnight interest rate, moving it above our target. And so we carried out open-market buyback operations to inject liquidity, with the goal of bringing the actual overnight rate closer to our target. We also temporarily expanded the list of securities that market participants could use as collateral in these buyback operations. In addition, we provided liquidity by increasing our supply of settlement balances as we normally do when we see an increased demand for cash balances. All told, our actions were effective in helping to improve the functioning of the overnight money market. So we have now restored our original list of securities eligible for use in buyback operations, and we have gradually reduced the level of settlement balances. And while it is true that many term money market spreads remain abnormally wide, the market is functioning. There have been increasing numbers of transactions in this area and spreads are beginning to narrow. In these circumstances, there does not appear to be anything the Bank of Canada could usefully do to improve the functioning of this market. The events of the summer have also had some important implications for our role as the country's monetary policy authority. Before explaining these implications, I should start with some background. The Bank's policy rate is our target for the overnight interest rate. This rate is crucial for the transmission of monetary policy throughout the economy. When we adjust our target for the overnight rate, we set in motion a chain of consequences that influences other interest rates in financial markets and, through the cost of credit, spending, production, employment and, ultimately, the rate of inflation. By adjusting our target, we are aiming to keep total demand and supply in the economy in balance, thus keeping inflation low, stable, and predictable. During the summer, however, we saw a widening of the spread between short-term market interest rates, such as the rate for commercial paper, and our target for the overnight rate. Should these wider spreads persist, it would represent a tightening of credit conditions in the economy that would occur independent from any movement in our target for the overnight rate. Thus, any given policy rate would be somewhat more restrictive than was previously judged. This leads me to what is perhaps the most important lesson that central bankers can learn from these events. Let me emphasize this by returning to the point I made earlier about how the process of securitization enhanced the ability of financial institutions to make loans. It 4 BIS Review 106/2007 
seems to me that in recent years, central bankers may not have fully appreciated just how much the increase in securitization represented an easing of credit conditions. Loans were being shifted off balance sheets, allowing more loans to be made. If securitization led to the creation of loans that would not otherwise have been made, then this was a source of demand in the economy that we as central bankers likely did not fully take into account. Any given policy rate would thus be less restrictive than was earlier judged, implying that interest rates globally might have been lower than would have been optimal. However, since both global and domestic inflation have been largely contained over this period, we should not exaggerate the magnitude of this effect. A reduction in securitization now seems likely, and we can expect a degree of re-intermediation by financial institutions. All other things equal, in Canada, this will lead to a higher cost of credit relative to the overnight interest rate than was the case prior to this summer. But how much tightening will this lead to in the longer run? And will the process of re-intermediation persist, and thus affect the conduct of monetary policy going forward? These are key questions that we at the Bank of Canada need to think about. And it may be some time before we have definitive answers.  The potential impact on the Canadian economy Finally, the more immediate question is: What are the implications of the turbulence in money markets for Canada's economy? As the Bank noted in its interest rate announcement earlier this month, the near-term economic prospects for the United States are weaker than earlier expected, as events in financial markets will likely exacerbate the adjustment in the U.S. housing sector, making it more pronounced and more protracted. This implies weaker U.S. demand for Canadian exports. However, economic growth in Canada in the first half of this year turned out to be stronger than we had projected, and near-term prospects for economic growth outside North America continue to be very favourable. And so at our last fixed announcement date, we said that the Canadian economy now appears to be operating further above its production potential than we had estimated at the time of our July Monetary Policy Report Update (MPRU). Domestic demand remains robust, buoyed by our continued strong labour market, rising wages, and higher-than-expected increases in housing sales and prices. But as I mentioned, the turbulence in financial markets has meant some tightening of credit conditions for Canadian borrowers. This should temper the growth of domestic demand, although the extent of this effect is difficult to assess. Against this background of a likely weaker track for exports and tighter credit conditions, along with signs of stronger domestic demand, we judged that the current level of our target for the overnight interest rate – 4 1/2 per cent – is appropriate. However, there are significant upside and downside risks to the outlook for inflation. On the upside, there is a possibility that household demand in Canada could be stronger than anticipated, while on the downside, the ongoing adjustment in the U.S. housing sector could be more severe and spill over to the U.S. economy more broadly. In recent days, the Canadian dollar has moved sharply above the trading range assumed in the July MPRU, and we need to look at the causes of this strengthening, should it persist. And, as always, we need to assess the effect of movements in the exchange rate on the balance of aggregate demand and supply in the Canadian economy. In addition, as I noted, there is uncertainty about the extent and duration of the tightening of credit conditions in Canada and, hence, about the tempering effect this will have on the growth of domestic demand. Gauging the effects of the financial market turbulence on credit conditions, and the implications for the Canadian economy, will be one of the Bank's most pressing tasks over the coming months. We will provide analysis of these issues in our next Monetary Policy Report, which will be published on 18 October.  BIS Review 106/2007 5 
Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, let me conclude. This was not a very pleasant summer for many people. Turbulence in financial markets is not easy to deal with, and it is certainly not welcome. But if we can learn from these events and retain the valuable lessons, then global financial markets can emerge from this turbulence stronger and more efficient than before. Ultimately, this can be to the benefit of us all. 6 BIS Review 106/2007 
Shamshad Akhtar: Pakistan Islamic banking – past, present and future outlook Keynote address by Dr Shamshad Akhtar, Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, at Dawn Asia Finance Conference, Karachi, 11 September 2007. *      *      * A.  Introduction Islamic finance has gripped the world with a strong fervor and passion. Interest in this discipline has proliferated to almost 60 countries, going beyond the Islamic world to the leading global financial centers. For quite sometime, United Kingdom has adopted an open door policy and provided a level playing field to Islamic finance and now Singapore is following its lead. Every day, Islamic finance is breaking new boundaries and new frontiers. Leading Islamic banks have fast spread their network from home base to develop a regional and global reach. Some of the Middle East banks are now entering into African and Central Asian markets and are sizing up Australian financial market.  Motivation and renewed interest in Islamic finance industry stems from its strong economic, financial and social considerations, backed by its unique features. Most significant is its appeal to add to financial diversity and innovation being skewed towards (i) asset backed and equity based transactions, which promote entrepreneur friendliness and consideration of project viability; (ii) equitable distribution of risks and rewards among the stakeholders; and (iii) inculcating market discipline and higher ethical standards given its emphasis on non-exploitation and social welfare. In the wake of high Asian domestic savings rates and build up of the region’s foreign exchange reserves as well as oil surpluses of Middle East in the last few years, Islamic finance is now also emerging as a way to wealth management, both of richer nations and high net worth individuals.  While the world is now recognizing the significance of Islamic finance industry, in Pakistan, as early as in 1948, Mr. Muhammad Ali Jinnah emphasized the virtues of Islamic principles and in his address at the inauguration of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), said:  “I shall watch with keenness the work of your Organization in evolving banking practices compatible with Islamic ideas of social and economic life. We must work our destiny in our own way and present to the world an economic system based on true Islamic concept of equality of manhood and social justice1.” B. Historical context of Pakistan’s Islamic finance Pakistan has a protracted history of Islamic banking with the initial attempt to Islamize banking system in 1980s2, leading to sweeping changes in the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962 (BCO’62) and associated laws and regulations to accommodate non-interest based banking transactions. Some specific developments around this period are noteworthy: i. In 1979, two Government-owned mutual funds in Pakistan, the NIT and ICP, started to eliminate interest from their operations by eschewing investment of their funds in                                                  1  Quaid-e-Azam: Speech at the foundation laying stone of the State Bank of Pakistan, 1st July 1948.  2  Aurangzeb Mehmood, “Islamisation of Economy in Pakistan: Past, Present and Future” Islamic Studies 41:4 (2002). BIS Review 106/2007 1 
interest bearing securities. Investor scheme of ICP was substituted as from October 1, 1980 by a new scheme based on profit and loss sharing.  ii. The state-run House Building Finance Corporation (HBFC) also eliminated interest from its operations from July 1, 1979.  iii. In June 1980, legal framework was amended to permit issuance of a new, interest-free instrument of corporate financing called Participation Term Certificate (PTC).  iv. A new law, namely, the Modaraba Companies and Modarabas Ordinance, 1980 along with the Modaraba Companies and Modaraba Rules, 1981 was promulgated to introduce modarabas, as a two-tier fund structure, for undertaking Shariah compliant businesses.  v. In 1984, the Banking and Financial Services Ordinance, 1984 amended seven laws and Banking Tribunals Ordinance, 1984 provided a new system of recovery of non-interest based modes of financing.  vi. From January 1, 1981, separate interest-free counters started operations in all the nationalized commercial banks to mobilize deposits on profit and loss sharing basis. Concurrently, banks were prohibited from specified interest based transactions, which resulted in development of Islamic modes of financing. vii. Finally, SBP issued BCD Circular No. 13 of 1984 that called for elimination of Riba from the banking system and in January 1, 1985 all financing to Federal and Provincial Governments, public sector corporations and public or private joint stock companies was directed to be only through interest-free modes.  viii. From July 1, 1985 all commercial banking in Pak Rupees was made interest free.3 Resultantly, profit and loss sharing (PLS) deposits, as a percentage of total deposits, rose from 9.2% at the end of 1981 to 61.6% by end of 1985.  These measures resulted in a country-wide roll out of Islamic banking. However, the premature and sudden conversion of banking system to Islamic system coupled with the lack of preparedness and understanding among financial institutions and public posed difficultly in implementation. The Federal Shariat Court challenged some emerging products and processes and declared them un-Islamic. The Shariat Appellate Bench of the Supreme Court upheld the decision of the Federal Shariat Court and offered guidelines to address the issues involved, setting a timeline for implementation. This decision was later set aside in a review petition filed by the United Bank.  C. Current state of industry Some key lessons emerge from Pakistan’s experience of 1980s. Firstly, it is prudent to allow industry to adopt an evolutionary process, rather than adopting a revolutionary approach, in order to nurture acceptability and development of Islamic finance industry. Secondly, flexibility rather than rigidity allows for effective accommodation of changing needs of a dynamic market. Thirdly, the markets and customers must have confidence in Shariah compliance by the Islamic finance industry to ensure sanctity of the system. Lastly, all stakeholders involved, including the regulators and the industry, have to be properly equipped and prepared for the eventual launch of a new system.  Valuable experience and lessons learned by the policy makers and the industry helped in the re-launch of Islamic banking in Pakistan in 1990s. In recent years, a notable element of SBP’s financial sector strategy was the introduction of Islamic Banking Policy in December 2001. Under this policy, Islamic banking is being promoted in parallel to the development of                                                  3  Mohsin S. Khan and Abbas Mirakhor: Islamic Banking, Experiences in Islamic Republic of Iran and Pakistan.  2 BIS Review 106/2007 
conventional finance industry in an integrated, gradual and steady manner. SBP has been issuing licenses for Islamic banking to stand alone Islamic banks and Al-Meezan Investment Bank, which had been functioning as an Islamic Investment Bank, became the first Islamic bank of the country upon award of Islamic banking license by SBP. In addition, SBP allows conventional banks to set up Islamic banking subsidiaries or dedicated Islamic banking branches to offer range of financial services.  SBP has put into place a comprehensive and robust multi-tiered Shariah compliance mechanism to lend customers and investors confidence in the Islamic banking industry. Shariah compliance mechanism has three main pillars: (i) a Shariah Board at SBP which approves policies and guidelines as well as the fit and proper criteria for Advisors;4 (ii) Shariah Advisors in all banks to provide guidance to banks and comfort to customers on Islamic financial services; and (iii) a Shariah audit system.  SBP has introduced nine model agreements and contracts for major Islamic modes of financing and Shariah audit guidelines for banks, after vetting and approval of the SBP Shariah Board. Work is underway on three more model contracts, namely, Diminishing Musharaka, Istijrar and Wakalah. Shariah compliance inspection of Islamic banks will start this year and will cover a review of the Islamic banks’ arrangements and operations, their services and products, financial statements and accounting records to ensure that all transactions are being carried out in accordance with the injunctions of Shariah.  Backed by this elaborate structure, today 6 full fledged Islamic banks (IBs) and 13 conventional banks offer a network of around 170 branches. Total assets of Islamic banks are close to Rs135 billion5 while Islamic deposits and financings stand at 2.9% and 2.4 % of market share respectively.  D. Future strategy and outlook While the number and operations of Islamic banks are fast expanding, this segment of the market is still small relative to the appetite for Islamic finance. Pakistan, in light of its past experience, is launching a gradual and steady approach to Islamic banking. Despite rapid expansion in industry, the share of Islamic banking in the total banking system is a modest 3.2%. Moreover, it only caters for around 23,000 borrowers through around 170 branches relative to the country-wide 5 million borrowers (or 4.8 million excluding microfinance borrowers) tapped through 7,700 branches by conventional banks. Financing and investment levels of Islamic banks barely range around Rs77 billion, which is below 3% of the total banking system’s advances6. On the product side, Islamic banks so far offer about 75% of products currently available in conventional banking while clean lending for consumer financing products, like personal loans and credit cards, still pose a challenge. Islamic banks operate exclusively in large cities with some now venturing into secondary cities but they are absent from rural areas where there is great potential for business growth. Global interest in Islamic finance industry and Pakistan’s success in laying basic foundation and core infrastructure of Islamic financial system lends confidence that the country has                                                  4  Further, it has also been specified that a Shariah Advisor shall not hold any executive/non-executive position in any other financial institution, except working as Shariah Advisor of Islamic mutual funds of the same IBI. Needless to mention that, Shariah Advisors of IBIs are also prevented from having any substantial interest in or becoming employees of same types of organizations like Exchange Companies, Corporate Brokerage Houses or Stock Exchange. These provisions in the Fit and Proper Criteria for Shariah Advisors have ensured objectivity in evaluation criteria, minimization of conflict of interest and induction of new lot of Shariah advisors in the market. 5  As on End March 2007 6  End March 2007 BIS Review 106/2007 3 
good potential and prospects to further exploit this industry. Going forward, however, it is important that Pakistan adopts a more calibrated and coordinated approach and strategy for the development of Islamic finance industry. In designing this strategy, Pakistan will conform to the standards being promoted by the Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB) – the sixteen member Council of Governors of Central banks with several associate and affiliate members – whose chairpersonship Pakistan assumes effective January 2008.  The goal and objectives of the forward looking strategy should be to offer an alternative avenue of financial intermediation, which is competitive and promotes efficient allocation of resources in an equitable manner. Strategy should aim to supplement conventional banking industry’s efforts to broaden and deepen the process of financial intermediation and financial penetration. Islamic banking can serve as a key vehicle to improve and strength the access to development finance by bringing in financial innovation that can cater adequately to diverse demands of the population as well as corporate sector’s and country’s infrastructure financing requirements, while ensuring that it nurtures faith based system of financing consistent with the Shariah principles.  Major elements of this strategy would require both industry and SBP to closely work together on multiple fronts. Some of the key areas of focus include: Aggressive deposit mobilization to augment domestic financial savings of the country. Although late starter, Islamic banks have phenomenal potential to exploit resource mobilization. Substantial savings have still not been channeled into the financial system because of reservations relating to interest based system or return deficiencies of the conventional system. Islamic banks, besides catering to the needs of small depositors through profit and loss sharing basic accounts with no charges, need to tap high net worth investors and companies which are increasingly being driven to the attractive options and returns being offered by more innovative players worldwide. Fast adaptation of these practices by the Islamic finance industry will be helpful in competing more effectively with conventional banks in raising deposits. Resource mobilization is critical for Islamic finance industry to grow effectively and meet the alternative requirements of economy and society.  Diversification and innovation of financial structures. This would involve either applying innovative Islamic products on a stand alone basis or applying a combination of Islamic instruments to suit project finance needs. In attempting the latter, it needs to be ensured that vanilla Islamic products such as Murabaha, Ijara and diminishing Musharaka etc. are implemented with their necessary preconditions, consistent with Shariah principles, to promote modes that can be used to finance commercial and project finance activity. This would require greater reliance on equity based financing, given that it is akin to participation and risk sharing consistent with infrastructure financing requirements and Islamic principles. At the same time, it requires financial engineering, flexibility in the evolving Sahriah system and alliance both among domestic and with the bigger global players (such as Standard Chartered, HSBC, UBS, Citibank etc.) to diversify Islamic financial structured products to support project finance in addition to associated real estate, shipping, trade, and aircraft financing.  Islamic financing products/structures are now quite common in Middle East and Saudi Arabia and have gained ground in non-Muslim countries too. In most cases it has to be recognized that Islamic financing is incorporated within a multi-sourced project financing offering, along side the conventional project financing structures backed with or without supportive credit enhancement or export credit agencies financing. The Islamic financing element of the project is provided pari passu with the other senior debt. Istisna’s and variant structure of Ijara are frequent products used. If required, there should be standard legal structure for establishing and operating with ease Islamic SPV as the financing vehicle. Islamic finance tranches are known to offer additional benefit of competitive pricing and tenor.  There should be harmonization of these alternate and multi-financing legal and regulatory structures and appreciation that conventional project financing documentation could be 4 BIS Review 106/2007 
acceptable to different Shariah Boards/Committees. Pakistan has been exposed to these structures, given its earlier experience with the Hub River project, which in early 1990s incorporated Islamic Tranche of Istisna, and more of such recent deals. In designing such structures there has to be more tolerance among participants to: • integrate Islamic and conventional funds to allow co-financed projects with different players;  • accept ownership risks (since in all Islamic transactions, lender is at some stage the owner of financed goods) but with comfort of clarity of legal issues surrounding ownership;  • ensure proper tax treatment of the proposed Islamic financing structures, avoiding adverse treatment relative to conventional borrowing, e.g. often profit participating payments are subject to tax while interest payments on loans are tax deductible;  • ensure flexibility in selection of assets for Islamic tranche;  • understand issues surrounding asset risks; and • provide for payment of insurance and maintenance expenses for Islamic financed assets etc.  Extend the outreach of financial services in a holistic manner with focus on underserved regions and poor and vulnerable groups. Islamic banks will be allowed to pursue their plans for branch expansion as long as Islamic banks, like conventional banks, open at least 20% of new bank branches in rural areas. Conventional banks will have the option to seek partial or full conversion to Islamic banks. Microfinance banks are to be allowed to set up special windows or dedicated branches for Islamic Microfinance operations and licenses will be given to dedicated Islamic Microfinance banks. Guidelines have been already issued to promote Islamic Microfinance industry. Similar initiatives will be launched to issue guidelines for promoting SME, Agriculture and Infrastructure financing.  Promote financial industry diversification by requiring that, in tandem with Islamic banking, there is adequate development in Islamic capital markets, which so far has lagged behind the banking sector.  Enhance understanding and capacities of Islamic Banking Risk Management. Risk magnifies in Islamic banking, considering that banks and customers operate on profit and loss sharing mechanism. Because of this participatory risk relationship, the financial institution may not be exposed to traditional credit risk associated with conventional banking but more to risks associated with assets financed and off-balance sheet risk linked with the transfer of assets and its management as well as any volatility in the values of underlying assets. In structuring new products, there is need for institutions to factor in appropriate risks of real commodities, properties and equipment being financed with proper risk mitigation management and techniques. The strategy has to recognize the risk associated with Islamic banking and as such it has to include appropriate mechanisms and approaches to mitigate these.  Promote development of liquidity management instruments to ensure investor confidence while effectively managing Islamic banking system’s systemic risk. Apart from Government’s efforts to launch Shariah compliant SLR securities, SBP will need to launch Shairah compliant Treasury Bills along the lines of other central banks which have a range of short term securities based on sales and purchase contracts that are tradable in the secondary market and launch Sukuk cum Ijarah instrument proposed by the Central bank-Islamic Industry Task Force in 2006. Islamic repos would be also need to be structured. To facilitate the issuance of these types of instruments, amendments will be required in SBP Act as well as setting aside of specific assets of public sector by the Government. Once these instruments grow, SBP will align the SLR for Islamic banks at par with the conventional banks’ SLR as the risk associated with Islamic banks are in some senses far greater than in BIS Review 106/2007 5 
conventional banks given their reliance on equity based diversified products. Some countries have even considered higher SLR for Islamic banks as their inherent risks are often times varying in nature and far steeper.  Promote international standards and best practices in Islamic Industry. Aside from standard application of conventional banking regulations and guidelines, Islamic banks will be encouraged to adopt IFSB and AAOIFI (Accounting and Auditing of Islamic Financial Institutions) standards with appropriate tailoring to suit domestic requirements. SBP is an active member of these international bodies and has provided input into the technical design and formulation of these standards.  Promote good corporate governance in Islamic banking. Islamic banks must exhibit unique fiduciary responsibilities towards investment account holders, ensure Shariah conformity and select investments that are Shariah compliant (avoiding products/businesses that are haram) as well as implement sound internal risk management. As such, they will be required to follow a distinct corporate governance framework in line with the IFSB’s Guiding Principles on Corporate Governance. Launch joint capacity building efforts for Islamic finance industry. SBP and the industry will promote capacity building for greater understanding of Shariah principles, asset and liability management, and features of product structure. In addition, specialized training will be needed to promote smooth and effective implementation of IFSB and AAOIFI standards.  E. Conclusion With its promising prospects and potential, Islamic banks will need to grow at least by 40-50% annually to be able to raise its share from 3.5% to about 15% of the total banking system. Given that banking industry as a whole has been growing at a substantively fast pace, the level of effort required for Islamic banks would have to be steeper to claim this share. Given the success of some countries in achieving this share for Islamic banking, it is important that concerted efforts are put in to propel Islamic banking system further and deeper in Pakistan.  6 BIS Review 106/2007 
Christian Noyer: No moral hazard – the banks are doing their job  Comment by Mr Christian Noyer, Governor of the Bank of France, in the Financial Times, 18 September 2007. *      *      * In recent weeks, Central Banks in Europe and the US have acted repeatedly to provide liquidity to interbank money markets. These interventions have raised some questions. Concerns were expressed that monetary authorities were bailing out speculators, thus creating the same kind of moral hazard that may have led to excesses in the past. There were also concerns as to whether the integrity of monetary policy would be compromised. These are valid questions. On numerous occasions, in the past, we pointed out the potential dangers that mispricing of credit risk posed for financial stability. We may be now seeing some of the consequences. Excessive risks were taken, and losses will have to be accepted. It is important that monetary and financial authorities take no action that would prevent this process from running its course, let alone be seeing to be condoning past or future excesses. However, the logic behind recent interventions is different. Put very simply, financial turbulence and uncertainty have suddenly triggered an upward shift in the demand for Central Bank money. Faced with such a shift, whose direction is apparent but amplitude uncertain, the choice, for monetary authorities, is clear: either accommodate, and provide temporary liquidity; or not, in which case, interest rates would have to rise to restore balance in the interbank market. Standard economic theory dictates that, in such circumstances, exogenous changes in money demand should indeed be accommodated. In a seminal article going back to 19701, William Poole showed that, when there is uncertainty about money demand, the optimal response is to stabilize the interest rate, thus letting money supply adjust. Since short-term interest rates are, for all Central Banks, the main policy tool, an increase in interbank rates over and above the official rate would indeed be tantamount to a shift in monetary policy. In contrast, liquidity provision by Central Banks has ensured that the overall policy stance has remained unchanged. A clear distinction has been – and will be – maintained between temporary liquidity provision, on the one hand, and medium term oriented monetary policy, on the other. Should liquidity be provided at a penalty rate, as some have argued, to avoid moral hazard? The answer is clearly positive if and when liquidity assistance is targeted at specific institutions. But there is no reason, for Central Banks, to significantly depart from prevailing policy rates if their main objective is to respond to an exogenous and general increase in demand for central bank balances. In the future, monetary policy may have to be adjusted, not for the purpose of easing financial tensions, but according to its own objective and in view of the state of the economy. As regards the euro area, the Governing Council has judged that, in the current uncertain environment, it was appropriate to gather additional information before drawing conclusions for monetary policy, although the overall stance is “still on the accommodative side” and… “the medium-term outlook for price stability remains subject to upside risks”. Looking further ahead, difficulties in the subprime mortgage markets combined with the generalized securitization of loans will lead to losses whose localization in the financial system remains undetermined. This information problem is currently creating uncertainty and                                                  1  Optimal Choice of Monetary Policy Instruments in a Simple Stochastic Macro Model ; The Quarterly Journal of Economics Vol. 84, No.2 (May, 1970) BIS Review 105/2007 1 
turmoil. However, things should be put in perspective. Available data indicate that, unless the economy unexpectedly deteriorates, those losses will remain small in comparison to total available capital in the financial system and should be easily absorbed. Of course, conditions remain fragile in many segments of the capital markets. Perverse dynamics may always develop. By acting to restore balance and stability in the interbank market, Central banks are just doing their job. 2 BIS Review 105/2007 
Zhou Xiaochuan: Providing financial support to enterprises “Going Abroad”  Speech by Mr Zhou Xiaochuan, Governor of the People’s Bank of China, at the 11th China International Fair for Investment and Trade and the International Investment Forum 2007, Xiamen, 8 September 2007. *      *      * Your Excellency Vice Premier Wu Yi,  Distinguished guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, Good morning! It is a great pleasure to attend the 11th China International Fair for Investment and Trade and the International Investment Forum 2007 in particular in the beautiful coastal city of Xiamen. On behalf of the People’s Bank of China, I would like to extend warm congratulations on the convocation of this Forum. Thanks to rapid economic globalization, the trade links between China and the rest of the world are expanding, and investment cooperation is deepening with each passing day. Since the initiation of reform and open-up, China has made remarkable achievements in attracting foreign capital and learning advanced technology and management expertise from other countries. At the same time, the Chinese enterprises are making good progress in their endeavor to invest and operate abroad. Indeed, this “going-abroad” endeavor has become a strategic measure of major importance as China’s open-up reaches a new stage. The financial sector has played an important role in these two-way interactions. But, the work of financial sector is not yet sufficient, in particular in terms of supporting enterprises going abroad. On this front, the financial sector has not fully adapted to the new developments in implementing the strategy of going abroad. Therefore, the People’s Bank of China attaches great importance to this matter and is intensifying research and study. In the future, measures will be taken to deepen and broaden the financial markets to satisfy demand of enterprises for foreign exchange products and risk management instruments, and change the foreign exchange administration policy that is strict with capital outflow and easy with inflow; greater convenience and facility will be provided in financial services to support enterprises going abroad in a better way.  First of all, the financial market will play a bigger role. We will actively foster foreign exchange market growth and encourage product development to help enterprises manage interest rate and exchange rate risks in their overseas investment and operation. In recent years, the People’s Bank of China has worked hard to foster foreign exchange market development. The products in the foreign exchange market are increasingly diversified. With the launch of RMB foreign currency swap transactions, and availability of future and swap foreign exchange sale and purchase to a larger variety of enterprises, the foreign exchange market has grown rapidly. The trading volume in the first half of 2007 was 4.5 times that in the corresponding period of 2005. In the future, in order to support overseas investment and operation of Chinese enterprises, we will make fresh efforts to develop the foreign exchange market, promote products diversification, and create a more favorable environment for instrument innovation.  Second, there will be stronger financial policy support. The foreign exchange administration reform will be deepened by lifting unnecessary controls and simplifying procedures to provide foreign exchange convenience to enterprises investing and operating abroad. Last year, the quota limit of foreign exchange purchase for overseas investment purpose was abolished to satisfy the need of enterprises in outward investment. In the next step, we will lift the control BIS Review 105/2007 1 
in terms of verification of sources of foreign exchange fund, examination prior to foreign exchange purchase, and repatriation of outward investment profit; we will allow enterprises to conduct outward investment with their own or purchased foreign exchange, and make it more convenient to use and transfer foreign exchange; research will be made to explore channels for domestic enterprises and financial institutions to support enterprises investing and operating abroad with foreign exchange.  Third, financial services will be improved to support eligible enterprises to invest and operate in other countries. Qualified financial institutions will be encouraged to establish overseas operations, and explore equity investment in overseas financial institutions through merger and acquisition, in order to provide enterprises with convenient financial services in their overseas investment and operation; enterprises investing and operating abroad are encouraged to take advantage of financing tools in host countries such as lending, asset securitization, stock offering, bond issue, project financing, and etc; domestic investment entities will be allowed to provide financing guarantee to their overseas subsidiaries subject to approval.  Fourth, regional financial platforms will be used to encourage enterprises to take part in international economic cooperation. China is a member of various regional development banks including Asia Development Bank, Africa Development Bank, West Africa Development Bank, PTA Bank and Caribbean Development Bank, and has applied to join the Inter-American Development Bank. Good cooperative relations have been developed with these regional development institutions. The People’s Bank has signed bilateral technical cooperation agreement or established bilateral technical cooperation fund with the Africa Development Bank, West Africa Development Bank, and Caribbean Development Bank. It is desirable to use these regional development banks as a platform for exchanges, and conduct project consulting and market research through bilateral technical cooperation fund and agreements, and better understand the business and legal environment of host countries. This will be a catalyst for the going abroad endeavor. Promoting the two-way interaction of foreign enterprises coming to China and Chinese ones going abroad is conducive to the economic complementarity and helps promote common prosperity, global harmony and progress. On this front, the financial sector definitely will do a lot more to provide support.  In conclusion, I wish the Forum a complete success.  Thank you. 2 BIS Review 105/2007 
Y V Reddy: The Reserve Bank and the State Governments – partners in progress Address by Dr Y V Reddy, Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the Madras School of Economics, Chennai, 23 September 2007. *      *      * Respected Dr. Rangarajan, Dr. Raja Chelliah, Dr. Srivastava, Professor Kumar and friends,  I am thankful to Dr. Srivastava for affording me the opportunity to participate in the annual day celebrations of the Madras School of Economics. It is an honour and privilege to be associated with the activities in a distinguished gathering such as this one. I was born in a village in Kadapa (then Cuddapah) district but went to High School in Chennai (then Madras), studying in Telugu medium. After a two-year stint in Government Arts College, Anantapur, I was back in Chennai for pursuing my university level studies in economics. My participation today in the annual day celebrations of the Madras School of Economics gives me an opportunity to express my gratitude to (Madras) Chennai which helped me in becoming and being a student of economics.  There are several reasons for selecting this subject for my address today. First, in the Indian federal polity, the States, relative to the Centre, have taken the centre-stage in the reform process since the areas of highest national priority now fall essentially within the purview of the States. For instance, agriculture, education, public health, sanitation and much of physical infrastructure belong primarily to the domain of the State Governments. Second, Dr. Rangarajan and Dr. Srivastava were Chairman and member, respectively, of the Twelfth Finance Commission, which made historic contribution to the Centre-State relations. It is also noteworthy that they addressed the Sixteenth Conference of State Finance Secretaries, held at the RBI. Third, it was Dr. Rangarajan who, in 1997, initiated the process of active interface between the Reserve Bank and the State Governments a decade ago, when he inaugurated, as the Governor of the RBI, the first Conference of State Finance Secretaries. Finally, there is very little literature available on the theory or practice of the role of the central banks at the level of sub-national governments. Hence, there may be some merit in recording our experience in this regard. I am taking this opportunity to chronicle the unique and productive partnership between the RBI and the State Governments in securing the progress of our economy, as part of economic reforms.  On November 8, 1997, Dr. Rangarajan, the then Governor of the RBI, in his inaugural address at the First Conference of the State Finance Secretaries convened by RBI, had flagged the issues that needed to be focussed upon in management of State finances. These included: alternative methods for borrowing by the States, statutory ceiling on debt, setting up of consolidated sinking fund and the issuance of State Government guarantees. I would like to report that most of his expectations have since been substantively met, as I will enumerate today, a little later. I would also like to place on record the high priority that continued to be accorded to this collaborative process by Dr. Jalan who succeeded Dr. Rangarajan as the Governor, RBI. For instance, in his inaugural address at the Tenth Conference of State Finance Secretaries, on June 7, 2002, stressing on the cooperative framework between the Centre and the States, Dr. Jalan had pointed out that there were lessons to be learnt from the coordinated approach adopted by some of the large federal governments in managing their finances successfully in contrast to some of the Latin American nations. He had noted that although the Centre’s large deficit had constrained its ability to support the States, the harmonious relations amongst the States, the Centre and the RBI, which are involved in the management of public finances in India, had enhanced the stability and integrity of India’s financial system. He had also reiterated the problems associated with the "automatic debit mechanism", stating that a BIS Review 105/2007 1 
State could not manage its finances if such a mechanism pre-empted a large portion of its available funds.  Mutual trust The “Reserve Bank of India” and “banking” find a listing in the Seventh Schedule of the Indian Constitution and hence, fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Central Government. The Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 provides that the Central Government shall entrust the RBI with all its money, remittance, exchange and banking transactions in India and the management of its public debt, and shall also deposit all its cash balances with the RBI, free of interest. On the other hand, the RBI may, by agreement with any State Government, take over similar functions on behalf of that Government. Accordingly, the RBI is the banker to both the Central Government and all the State Governments, except two, in the Indian Federation.  The RBI also manages the open market borrowings of the Central Government and all the States, with two exceptions. The market-borrowing programme of the State Governments is finalised by the Government of India and the Planning Commission, keeping in view the provisions of Article 293(3) of the Constitution of India. The Article stipulates that a State may not, without the consent of the Government of India, raise any borrowings if it has any loan outstanding, which is repayable to the Government of India. The RBI has, over the years, closely interacted with the State Governments in its developmental role – particularly in areas of development of agriculture, and small industries. The RBI was specifically entrusted with an important promotional role, since its inception, of financing agricultural operations and marketing of crops. In fact, the Agricultural Credit Department was created simultaneously with the establishment of the RBI in 1935.  The Reserve Bank prepares and publishes an annual Study on the State Government Finances. This is a unique study since it compiles, consolidates and analyses detailed data on the budgets of all the State Governments. It also documents the policy initiatives on State finances and debt management by the State Governments, the Government of India and the Reserve Bank. The study has been well received by policy makers and academicians, both in India and abroad, and is an important reference document. It is noteworthy that the interface between the RBI and the State Governments arises not only out of statutorily mandated obligations but also voluntarily, based on mutual trust. The mechanism of bi-annual conference of the State Finance Secretaries has formalised and strengthened the process of partnering for progress, based on mutual respect, through a process of continuing consultations, but with the States retaining their freedom. Apart from the State Finance Secretaries, senior functionaries of the Government of India, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, the Controller General of Accounts and the Planning Commission as also heads of select departments of the Reserve Bank are invited to the Conference. There are occasions when fiscal experts such as Mr. A. Premchand, Mr. M.S. Ahluwalia from the Planning Commission, leading commercial bankers and representatives of credit rating agencies are also invited to participate and contribute to the specific issues on the agenda. Open market borrowings The normal procedure followed for open market borrowings, until the first half of the nineties, was that the RBI would complete the combined borrowings of all States in one or two tranches at a predetermined coupon, which was common to all States and was on par with that of the Central Government. After announcement of the loan, the RBI would write to the banks indicating the contribution expected from them, mainly based on their market-share of deposits, with a request to invest in the State Government bonds. Thus, high statutory pre-2 BIS Review 105/2007 
emptions in the form of Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) in respect of the banks and the tying-up of the loans by the RBI ensured a captive market for these loans amongst the banks and the successful completion of the allocated borrowing programme. With the substantial increase in the market borrowing programme of the Central Government, progressive reduction in the SLR, increasing sophistication of the Indian debt markets offering diversified portfolio choices to banks, mark-to-market valuation norms, changes in risk weighted capital prescriptions and the deteriorating financial position of the States, it was becoming increasingly difficult to complete the market borrowings of the States, through the tranche system, at pre-announced coupon. To reflect these new realities, including the market perception of the status of the State Governments, in 1997, the coupon rate for the entire borrowing programme for all the States was fixed broadly on the basis of a mark-up (which was initially 25 basis points and later increased to 50 basis points) over the yield of ten-year stock of the Central Government. Apart from the fact that the banks displayed an increasing reluctance to voluntarily invest in the State Government paper, the market had started discriminating amongst the States based on their perceived strengths and weaknesses; thus adversely affecting completion of the approved borrowing programme for the States. The Central Government had switched over to the auction method for its open market borrowing programme since 1993 and in view of the experience described above, it was felt necessary for the State Governments to explore the possibility of adopting a flexible approach with regard to interest rate, maturity, etc., of their borrowings. It was also felt that in view of inter-State disparities, a gradual and cautious approach was necessary. Based on the consensus at the first Conference of the State Finance Secretaries, an option was made available to the State Governments to enter the market through a flexible approach, on their own, to the extent of 5 to 35 per cent of their gross market borrowings. The timing and volume of issues for auction were to be decided by the RBI, in consultation with the State Governments, taking into account the market and liquidity conditions. This dispensation enabled the well-managed States to take advantage of the market conditions and raise loans at finer rates while the smaller States were able to protect their interests by substituting a part of their borrowings under the totally pre-announced coupon approach, with the auction method. The State Governments were subsequently encouraged to progressively further increase the share of market-borrowings under the auction route initially to 50 percent and thereafter to cover the entire market-borrowings. The auction system was experimental since the year 1998-99 with one State adopting the auction route in January 1999. The number of States adopting the auction route increased gradually in subsequent years. With the implementation of the recommendations of the Twelfth Finance Commission (TFC), the year 2005-06 marked a watershed in the evolution of the finances and the (open market) debt management operations of the State Governments. Spurred by the moderation in fiscal imbalances and progressive enactment of Fiscal Responsibility Legislation by the States – induced in some measure by the incentivised Debt Relief Scheme recommended by the TFC – the market perception regarding the fiscal position of the States seemed to have improved considerably. As many as 24 States opted for the auction route during 2005-06 as compared with only three States in the previous year. The States raised 48.5 per cent of their total borrowings through the auction route during 2005-06. The cut-off yields in the auctions were, in general, lower than the tap issues.  The market borrowings of the State Governments during 2006-07 and 2007-08 so far have been raised entirely through the auction route, with a general decline in spreads. In brief, the migration from the system of administered borrowing programme to the auction method of borrowing in respect of the States was achieved gradually and through a consultative process between the States and the RBI. BIS Review 105/2007 3 
Consolidated Sinking Fund At the request of the State Governments, the Reserve Bank had prepared a model Consolidated Sinking Fund (CSF) Scheme and circulated it amongst them for adoption / consideration in 1999. By the time of the ninth Conference of the State Finance Secretaries held in November 2001, 11 States had set up the CSF, which is being administered by RBI. The Twelfth Finance Commission had recommended that the CSF may cover repayments in respect of all the loans of the State Governments (and not just open market borrowings). Furthermore, the Bezbaruah Committee on Ways and Means Advances (WMA) to States had recommended that the States would be entitled to the Special WMA to the extent of their net incremental annual investment in the CSF, subject to the prescribed ceilings. Against this backdrop, the Reserve Bank circulated a revised model scheme of CSF amongst the State Governments in May 2006. As on June 30, 2007, of the eighteen State Governments that had set up the CSF, 11 had established it as per the revised CSF scheme. Many more States have intimated their intention to adopt the revised CSF scheme, as administered by RBI. Prepayment of debt In the context of build up of cash balances, two States proposed to utilise their surplus cash to pre-pay a part of their outstanding open market debt. In this connection, the modalities of buyback auctions were finalised by the Reserve Bank in consultation with these State Governments and the Government of India. General issues relating to the pre-payment of debt were discussed at the 18th conference of the State Finance Secretaries, held in August 2006. The RBI has conducted two rounds of buyback auctions in February and March 2007. State Government guarantees Issues relating to State Government guarantees have also been discussed in almost every conference of the State Finance Secretaries. Against the imperative of infrastructural development, the States have been under pressure to provide guarantees for facilitating the flow of funds to the high-priority sectors, State public sector enterprises, developmental institutions and local bodies, for commercial as well as non-commercial activities as also for urban development. The element of risk associated with such guarantees, transparency with regard to the guarantee policies and the magnitude of guarantees extended by the State Governments have raised concerns regarding the optimal or sustainable level of such guarantees. It is well recognised that while the guarantees, being contingent liabilities, do not form part of the debt, as conventionally measured, these have, in the eventuality of default, the potential of straining an apparently sound fiscal system. At the first Conference of the State Finance Secretaries held in November 1997, the issue of government guarantees was deliberated upon at length and the view taken was that, in the interest of prudent financial management and the credibility of the guarantees issued, there was a need for a policy on guarantees for each State Government within certain national parameters. Accordingly, a Technical Committee was constituted to examine the issue of State Government guarantees, in all its aspects. The report of the Committee was discussed at the third Conference of the State Finance Secretaries, held in January 1999, and pursuant to the recommendations of the Committee, several States have since taken the initiative to fix a ceiling on guarantees to be issued by them.  The devolvement probabilities of various guarantees are not identical and consequently, all guarantees can not be treated uniformly in terms of their fiscal impact. In order, therefore, to assess the fiscal risk arising out of guarantees in a more realistic and objective manner, there was a need to evolve a methodology for classifying guarantees into appropriate categories, with each category reflecting broadly similar fiscal impact. This, in turn, was expected to facilitate the fixing of ceiling on guarantees in a non-mechanistic fashion to better 4 BIS Review 105/2007 
capture the risk inherent in guarantees, and to enable adoption of better provisioning techniques to cover these contingent liabilities. In this backdrop, it was decided to constitute a Group of State Finance Secretaries on the Fiscal Risk on State Government Guarantees to examine the fiscal risk of guarantees extended by the State Governments. The report of the Group was discussed at the tenth Conference of the State Finance Secretaries, held in June 2002. The general consensus that emerged at the Conference was to place the Report of the Group in the public domain. It was also agreed to explore the possibility of extending the scope of the relative RBI circular addressed to the banks, to the financial institutions also so that they too would undertake due diligence and proper appraisal in financing of projects rather than merely relying on the State Government guarantees in their favour. It was also proposed that States could be provided technical assistance in regard to assigning appropriate risk weights to the guarantees. The Reserve Bank organises workshops on the evaluation of fiscal risk of guarantees for the benefit of State Government officials. Representatives of credit rating agencies are also invited to give presentations at the workshops. So far, four such workshops have been organised. It was also decided that the State Governments would be encouraged to seek, for their internal use, credit ratings from a rating agency so that they could initiate appropriate measures to improve their financial performance when they approached the market to mobilise resources.  The Reserve Bank circulated a draft scheme on Guarantee Redemption Fund (GRF) amongst the State Governments for voluntary adoption. As an incentive to build up the Consolidated Sinking Fund (CSF) and GRF, the Bezbaruah Committee (2005) had recommended that net incremental (i.e., new investment less redemption/liquidation) annual investment of States in CSF/GRF would be made eligible for availing Special WMA, but up to a ceiling equivalent to the Normal WMA limit. Keeping this in view, the Reserve Bank circulated revised draft GRF scheme amongst the State Governments in May 2006. As on June 30, 2007, eight State Governments had set up the GRF, of which three had put in place the revised scheme. Ways and Means Advances, and cash management The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been extending Ways and Means Advances (WMA) to State Governments since 1937 with the objective of covering temporary mismatches in the cash flows of their receipts and payments.  The WMA Scheme has been periodically revised, right since the early 1950s, in the light of the perceived requirements of the State Governments, keeping in view the evolving fiscal, financial and institutional developments as well as the objectives of monetary and fiscal management. State-wise limits in respect of Normal and Special WMA are determined based on certain parameters and have been revised, periodically, over the years. An overdraft (OD) occurs whenever these limits are exceeded. Maximum time-period (days) and/or financial limits up to which the State Governments can remain in overdraft have been specified; these limits have also been revised periodically. Payments on behalf of the State Governments are suspended in case the OD limits are breached. Till the late 1990s, the Normal and Special WMA limits of State Governments were fixed in terms of specified multiples of their minimum balances kept with the RBI. Both the minimum balances and the “multiples” to obtain the Normal WMA limits, were revised upwards a number of times (though not necessarily at the same time) over the years.  There have been strong demands from several States, from time to time, for upward revision of the WMA limits. RBI had taken the view that WMA is meant for meeting the temporary mismatches in the cash flows and hence, any upward revision in the WMA limits to meet BIS Review 105/2007 5 
structural deficits of the States is inappropriate. The matter remained a contentious issue for some time.  The initiation of the Conference of State Finance Secretaries in 1997 induced a transformation in the approach to formulating changes in the WMA Scheme. Distinct from the past, Advisory Committees were periodically constituted by the Reserve Bank to review the prevailing WMA arrangements and recommend changes, as considered appropriate, in the light of the evolving circumstances. The involvement of experts from outside the Reserve Bank in such Advisory Committees helped to strengthen and broad-base the modalities for effecting appropriate changes in the WMA Scheme. In fact, three Advisory Committees, that have been constituted so far, have been chaired by experts from outside the Reserve Bank and have included other “external” experts apart from senior functionaries from the Reserve Bank, as members. The first informal Advisory Committee on the WMA to State Governments was constituted in 1998, under the chairmanship of Shri B.P.R. Vithal. As a major break from the past practices, the Vithal Committee recommended the de-linking of the size of the Normal WMA limit with the minimum balances held by the States on the grounds that "fixing the WMA limits as multiples of an unchanged minimum balance, as in the past, does not capture the differing needs of the States in line with the different growth in their budgetary transactions. This has resulted in wide inter-State variations in the WMA limits in relation to the size of the Budget, and this needs to be corrected." The Vithal Committee instead proposed linking the normal WMA limit to the cash flows of the State. The recommendations were implemented in the light of further consultations with the States and the Centre. Subsequently, similar committees (Ramachandran Committee, 2003 and Bezbaruah Committee, 2005) have refined and improved upon the WMA arrangements. It is noteworthy that WMA arrangements have ceased to be a contentious matter amongst the Centre, States and RBI on account of the reliance placed on the advice from the outside experts and intensive consultations amongst the stakeholders, in finalising the arrangements. The upsurge in the surplus cash balances of some of the State Governments since the middle of 2004-05, in contrast to the liquidity pressures witnessed in the earlier period, has posed newer challenges to financial and cash management of State Governments. The issues relating to investment of cash balances of the States were discussed at the 18th Conference of State Finance Secretaries held in August 2006 and also in the 20th Conference of State Finance Secretaries held in August 2007. Taking note of the discussions, the Reserve Bank is in the process of formulating the plans in this regard, in consultation with the Centre and the States.  Advice on fiscal management The importance of fiscal transparency has got reinforced in the recent years after Government of India subscribed, in 1997, to the Special Data Dissemination Standards (SDDS) promulgated by the International Monetary Fund. In the light of this development, it was decided to constitute a Group of the State Finance Secretaries to suggest various measures of disclosure, which could be introduced in the budgetary exercise of the State Governments. It was also decided that the Group could lay down a model budget for the States, which would enable the Legislature and the public to enhance their understanding of the State finances. The Group suggested, inter alia, that it would also be useful if the State Governments could publish a document akin to the Budget at a Glance of the Union Budget furnishing the estimated levels of Gross Fiscal Defiit (GFD) and Primary Deficit (PD) of the State, including their ratio to the State Development Product (SDP). The document could also incorporate time-series data on important fiscal variables of the State. The levels of outstanding debt, guarantees extended, wages and salaries, and subsidies could also be explicitly indicated. Many States have, in the light of these deliberations, modified their budget-related documents to enhance fiscal transparency. 6 BIS Review 105/2007 
A Group was constituted in February 2003 to undertake a study of the pension liabilities of the State Governments and make suitable recommendations. The Group observed that if pension payments of the States were to grow at the historical average growth rate, pension payments alone would pre-empt about 20 per cent of the total revenue receipts of the States and as much as 30 per cent of the revenue receipts in the year 2010-11. Thus, purely from the perspective of fiscal sustainability of the States and the magnitude of the problem, structural alteration in the existing pension scheme, appeared necessary. The Group recommended introduction of contributory pension scheme/s for the new employees of the State Governments in lieu of the existing non-contributory defined-benefit pension scheme. The Group also recommended three alternative pension models, which are to be acted upon by the States as they consider appropriate. As per the available information, 19 State Governments have notified a defined-contribution pension scheme for their new employees. Recognising the absence of unanimity about the exact level, composition, and methodology for compiling the liabilities of the State Governments in India, it was decided in August 2004, to constitute a working group to evolve a methodology. The Group recommended that the compilation of data on the budgetary liabilities should be consistent with those in respect of the Gross Fiscal Deficit and accordingly, specified the constituent items. The Group also recommended exclusion of the implicit/contingent liabilities from the definition of budgetary liabilities, reckoning the wide divergence in views on the various items that should be included under implicit liabilities. It, however, recommended the disclosure of information on various implicit liabilities along with the budgetary liabilities. The Group recommended specific formats for timely release of data on the liabilities in the budget documents of the State Governments. The Group also recommended that the Reserve Bank should compile and publish the data on the liabilities of the States in its annual study on the State budgets; this recommendation has already been implemented.  Fiscal responsibility legislation The RBI had provided detailed and comprehensive technical inputs to the Government of India for formulating a Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Law, which culminated in the enactment of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act by the Parliament. In view of this successful outcome, State Finance Secretaries expressed a desire for similar advice to them from the RBI. Accordingly, a group was constituted in October 2003 with select State Finance Secretaries and a representative from the Government of India, Ministry of Finance, as members, to prepare a model fiscal responsibility legislation for the States. The draft Report of the Group was discussed at the 14th Conference of the State Finance Secretaries, held in August, 2004 and the final report was submitted to the Reserve Bank in January 2005. The Group decided that the model legislation would generally follow the pattern of the Central FRBM Act, and build upon the State fiscal responsibility legislations already enacted. The Group also took into account the international best practices available in the area as well as the recommendations of the various committees on fiscal transparency and on the issues related to voluntary disclosure of information by the State Governments. Various dimensions of the fiscal legislative framework, such as, the choice of targets, the road map for achievement of the targets, need for a detailed set of illustrative rules, independent evaluation criteria, prioritisation of capital expenditure, treatment of contingent liabilities including guarantees, computation of pension liabilities, etc., were deliberated upon to arrive at a consensus. The Group felt that the model Bill would provide guidance to the States for enacting their fiscal responsibility legislations with reference to certain benchmarks.  The objective of the Group was to design a template for the fiscal responsibility legislation for the States on the basis of feasibility on pragmatic considerations and enforceability, taking into account the diverse requirements of various States. It was considered desirable to allow each State to take a view on the sequencing of adoption of various provisions of the model Bill, fixing the actual targets, time frame for implementation thereof and allocating the BIS Review 105/2007 7 
provisions between the Act and the Rules, depending on its fiscal capabilities and further refining the provisions given in the model bill within the overall framework of fiscal prudence and sustainability.  All State Governments, except two, have already enacted fiscal responsibility legislation. New arrangements for borrowings by the States  According to the TFC, it would be appropriate for the States to take advantage of the prevailing market rates and avoid the spread charged by the Centre on the assistance provided by it. The pattern of Central assistance included loan as a major element in respect of general category States, which was implicitly funded from borrowings by the Centre and hence, the terms of loans extended to the States reflected the Centre’s cost of borrowings. To the extent these arrangements prevailed, there was, in effect, intermediation by the Centre in the provision of loans to the States as part of the Central assistance. The TFC, therefore, recommended that the Central Government should not act as an intermediary for future lending and allow the States to approach the market directly. If some fiscally weak States were unable to raise funds from the market, the Centre could borrow for the purpose of on-lending to such States, but the interest rates should remain aligned to the marginal cost of borrowing for the Centre. This approach was accepted by the Central Government, in principle, to be implemented in phases, in consultation with the Reserve Bank.  The new arrangements for ensuring disintermediation of the Centre in respect of States’ borrowings were deliberated upon, at the Conferences of State Finance Secretaries and by the Monitoring Group on Cash and Debt Management of the Government of India and RBI. In the light of these discussions and in order to operationalise the new arrangements, the Government of India constituted a Technical Group, with Smt. Shyamala Gopinath, Deputy Governor, RBI as chairperson and the officials of the Government of India, select States and the Reserve Bank, as its members. The Technical Group submitted its report to the Government of India in December 2005 and made several recommendations. In tune with the recommendations of the Group, there has been noticeable progress in regard to drawing up of calendar of borrowings, re-issuance of securities and adoption of the auction method for borrowing by the States. In addition, on the lines of the recommendations of the Working Group on Liquidity of State Government Securities (Chairman – Shri. V.K.Sharma), 2005, State Development Loans (SDLs) have been made eligible for repo transactions under the liquidity adjustment facility of the RBI and it has been decided to introduce the non-competitive bidding facility in respect of the primary auctions of SDLs. As far as the arrangements for sharing the corpus of the National Small Savings Fund (NSSF) are concerned, in accordance with the decision of the National Development Council, the obligatory share of the States has been reduced to 80 per cent with effect from the year 2007-08.  Loan Council The TFC had also recommended that "…..States, like the Centre, must decide their annual borrowing programme within the framework of their respective fiscal responsibility legislations…. The overall limit to their annual borrowings from all sources should be supervised by an independent body like a Loan Council with representatives from the Ministry of Finance, Planning Commission, Reserve Bank of India and the State Governments. The Council may, at the beginning of each year, announce the annual borrowing limits for each State, taking into account the sustainability considerations….." (Para 15.7).  It was, however, felt that setting up of a new institution, like the Loan Council, would entail additional cost in terms of physical and human resources and would take time. Moreover, a 8 BIS Review 105/2007 
large majority of States are currently seized with the task of addressing structural issues in managing government finances which, if carried on to their logical conclusion, could usher in an era of debt sustainability over the medium-term of the TFC period. The Loan Council could lose its raison d’etre once the fiscal situation became tractable, as seems to have been the case with the Australian Loan Council, which provides the international best practice in respect of coordinated borrowings by the Federal and State Governments. Against this backdrop, the Technical Group felt that the objective of securing coordinated borrowings between the Centre and the States on the one hand, and between the States on the other, could be best served by the setting up a Standing Technical Committee (STC) with representation from the Central Government, State Governments and the RBI. The Terms of Reference of the STC are to make annual projections of borrowing requirements of the State Governments; build alternative scenarios and suggest alternative strategies and instruments for raising resources of the States; advise on a mechanism for annual allocation of market borrowings amongst the States; take note of actual borrowings of the State governments during the year vis-à-vis the budgeted GFD and develop an appropriate database that would facilitate the monitoring exercise; assess fiscal risks from issuances of State Government guarantees; and advise State Governments on various issues relating to their borrowings.  The first meeting of the STC was held during the 20th Conference of the State Finance Secretaries held in August 2007.  Management of foreign exchange risk  The external assistance by multilateral agencies to the States has traditionally been routed through the Central Government as part of the Central assistance, with the Centre bearing the foreign exchange risk. However, as part of the policy of disintermediation of the Centre in the borrowings by the States, it was decided by the Central Government that there should be a back-to-back transfer of external assistance to the States. At the 16th Conference of the State Finance Secretaries, some of the State Finance Secretaries suggested that the RBI could play an advisory role in assisting the States in hedging their exchange rate risks arising from the policy of back-to-back transfer of external assistance. In the context of the TFC recommendations and following the discussions at the 19th Conference of the State Finance Secretaries, held in January 2007, the first workshop on the management of foreign exchange risk by the States through the financial markets was organised by the Reserve Bank in May 2007, for the benefit of the State Government officials.  The States have also proposed alternative mechanisms for providing for foreign exchange risk by setting aside funds in their budgets, where the Reserve Bank is expected to play a role in managing these funds on the lines of the CSF. These proposals were discussed at the 20th Conference of the State Finance Secretaries, held in August 2007.  Selective broadening and deepening of relationship  There are many areas in which there has been close coordination between the RBI and the States. For some of the important areas of the RBI’s responsibilities, there are standing institutional mechanisms at the State level, with which the Regional Offices of the RBI and the concerned officials of the State Governments are associated. The more important areas of close coordination relate to the provision of overall physical security for the banking system, matters relating to coins and currency and responses to natural calamities. Considerable decentralisation of powers and responsibilities to Regional Offices of the RBI has been brought about to facilitate locally relevant solutions to the problems, as they arise. The empowerment of Regional Offices has been combined with promoting State-specific BIS Review 105/2007 9 
initiatives, both in policy and implementation. The Regional Offices play a facilitating role in bringing together the contending parties when some tensions arise, that affect the financial system. One of the examples relates to resolution of stand-off between a State Government and the microfinance institutions on the terms of loans granted and methods for recovery of dues employed by the microfinance institutions. Similarly, considerable latitude is provided, to suit the local conditions, in the deliberations of State Level Bankers’ Committees, and there are many instances of the State Finance Ministers and Chief Ministers presiding over such meetings. In the broad area of banking, an innovative mechanism has been designed to resolve the issue of dual control in regard to the urban cooperative banks. Several States, together accounting for over seventy percent of urban banking activity, have signed Memorandum of Understanding with the RBI to constitute in each State a Task Force on Urban Co-operative Banks (TAFCUB) to ensure co-ordinated actions to revive and strengthen this sector. This has been, by all accounts, an outstanding success. Similarly, Empowered Committees have been constituted in all the States to reorganise, strengthen and expand the Regional Rural Banks. In the matters relating to revival of rural cooperatives also, State-specific packages are considered. Special plans for coordinated actions for select States, where the spread and depth of banking services are poor, have been mounted, the examples being the north-eastern States, Uttarakhand and Bihar. More recently, a vigorous programme of financial inclusion has been initiated to ensure the offer of banking services to the whole population. The RBI plays the lead role in each State, while the State Government participates in the movement, for operationalising the approach. The States have particular interest in this programme to ensure efficient and inexpensive disbursal of funds under several social security related and rural employment programmes. The recent developments in technology are facilitating this process. Simultaneously, some States have shown enthusiasm for extending financial literacy and RBI is encouraging its Regional Offices to respond, preferably in the local language, and the RBI website attempts to disseminate information in several of these languages. We do recognise that while we should avoid overstretching our resources, we should be willing to interact and respond positively to the genuine demands of the State Governments that are legitimate concerns of the RBI. No doubt, the State-specific considerations would govern State-specific responses, within the overall policy framework of the RBI. There are many areas, which are perhaps of greater relevance to the Central Government than to the RBI, in which the States seek the RBI’s involvement but we are constrained to carefully distance ourselves. Some time ago, there was a strong appeal from several States that the RBI should award a rating to the quality of fiscal management of all the States, which would carry greater weight and foster better response from the political leadership of the States concerned. The RBI had to politely decline the request since, as an institution, it should not appear to be ranking the States or passing judgments on their fiscal performance.  Outcomes and challenges  Having delineated the efforts and the processes of collaboration between the States and the RBI, it is only appropriate to briefly enumerate the outcomes and to recognise the critical challenges that lie ahead for the State finances and the RBI.  First, the progressive enactment of Fiscal Responsibility Legislations (FRLs) by as many as 26 State governments has indeed strengthened the fiscal consolidation initiatives at the State level.  Second, the gross fiscal deficit of States, which had increased from an average of 2.8 per cent of GDP in the first half of the 1990s to an average of over 4 per cent of GDP in the first half of the present decade, was placed at 2.5 per cent of GDP in 2005-06 and is expected to be brought down to 2.4 per cent in the budget estimates for 2007-08. The revenue deficit, 10 BIS Review 105/2007 
which had increased to an average of 2.2 per cent of GDP in the first half of the present decade, has remained at less than 0.1 per cent since 2005-06. In fact, an aggregate revenue surplus (of 0.4 per cent of GDP) has been budgeted for 2007-08. All States, except eight, have budgeted for a revenue surplus during 2007-08. Third, open market borrowings of the State Governments have been conducted entirely through the auction route during 2006-07 and 2007-08 (so far). The spreads for almost all the States, over the yields of Central Government securities of comparable maturity during 2006-07 and 2007-08 so far, has remained well below 50 basis points (spread fixed in the case of tap issuances), reflecting favourable market perception.  Fourth, as far as the State Government guarantees are concerned, the volume is on a declining path: guarantees were placed at 6.5 per cent of GDP as of end-March 2005 as compared with 8.0 per cent as at end-March 2001. Many States have imposed administrative/ legislative ceilings on guarantees. Eight States have set up Guarantee Redemption Funds to provide for the possible invocation of guarantees.  Fifth, 18 States have set up Consolidated Sinking Funds to provide for orderly repayments of their open market borrowings. Of these, 11 States have adopted the revised CSF scheme which provides for repayments of all liabilities (and not just open market loans). Many more States have proposed to set up the revised CSF. Sixth, the cash management of the State Governments has shown a marked improvement in recent years. The daily average utilisation of Normal WMA, Special WMA and overdrafts by the State Governments declined during 2006-07. During 2006-07, eight States availed WMA as against 12 States in the previous year. Only two States resorted to overdrafts during 2006-07 as against eight States in the previous year.  Notwithstanding the positive developments and prospects, there would remain a few areas of concern.  There are certain risks to the process of fiscal consolidation such as the expected increase in expenditure from the revision of pay scales of the State Government employees, pursuant to the implementation of the ensuing recommendations of the Sixth Pay Commission. In this connection, State Governments would need to make their budgets robust enough to enable them to steadfastly adhere to the provisions of their Fiscal Responsibility Legislations. Fiscal empowerment through revenue augmentation holds the key to address such fiscal risks. Initiatives by the States would be needed to develop a calendar for open market borrowings by the States, on the lines issued by the Government of India. This would enhance transparency, reduce uncertainty for the market participants and thereby help to further smoothen market-borrowing operations. Re-issuance of State Government securities would also help to build up a critical minimum size of securities, which would, in turn, help to enhance their liquidity. The Reserve Bank continues to receive complaints from the banks and financial institutions regarding defaults in honouring of obligations under the State Government guaranteed bonds. Such issues need to be addressed by the State Governments as this would impact on their credibility and market perception of their financial position.  At the same time, issues relating to the insistence of certain (re-financing) institutions for provision of State Government guarantees, irrespective of the financial viability of projects, perhaps on account of legal requirements, also need to be addressed at an appropriate forum. The State Government expenditures on education and health remain low at around 2.5 per cent and 0.7 per cent of GDP, respectively. These expenditures may need to be enhanced to make a long-term impact on the level of human development in the country, within the framework of Fiscal Responsibility Legislation. At the same time, issues relating to the quality and timeliness of providing such social sector services need to be expeditiously addressed. BIS Review 105/2007 11 
From the Reserve Bank’s standpoint, initiatives relating to credit culture, financial literacy, financial inclusion and priority sector lending would continue to remain high on the policy agenda. Concluding remarks  RBI has considerable professional skills and the States recognise and value them better when we are willing to consider State-specific orientation to our broader analysis. The RBI, like most of the central banks, commands considerable credibility and good public image and as a public institution is considered relatively apolitical in viewing the vertical relations between the Centre and the States and horizontal ones amongst the States. The bi-annual Conference of the State Finance Secretaries sponsored by the RBI has proved to be an excellent forum for wide-ranging discussions. The Technical Committees or Groups that are formed, have membership entirely from the States, though Centre may occasionally be associated, but RBI provides secretarial and technical support. The Centre and each State concerned decides the appropriate course of actions. The fact that some of the States have adopted a few but not all the recommendations of the Committees and Groups, demonstrates the shift away from the perceived centralisation of the past towards a participative process. I am happy to submit that all the States, though with varying degrees of enthusiasm, fully endorse the immense contribution of the process of partnering between RBI and the States in the cause of better financial sector and fiscal empowerment in the States. Let me conclude with profuse thanks to the Madras School of Economics for provoking me to think aloud on this subject and share the thoughts with wider audience.  The School came into existence in 1995, but very soon, it could obtain “A” Grade from the National Assessment & Accreditation Council. The Ministry of Environment and Forests has also designated the school as a Centre of Excellence in Environmental Economics. I have no doubt that the School would emerge to be an internationally recognised Centre of Excellence in economic studies attracting the best of students and teachers from different parts of the country as well as other countries. On our part, we in the RBI are in close touch with the School with a view to obtaining their expertise in the process of monetary policy formulation. Thank you. 12 BIS Review 105/2007 
Donald L Kohn: Success and failure of monetary policy since the 1950s Remarks by Mr Donald L Kohn, Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at “Monetary Policy over Fifty Years”, a conference to mark the 50th anniversary of the Deutsche Bundesbank, Frankfurt am Main, 21 September 2007.  *      *      * I appreciate this opportunity to speak on the occasion of the Deutsche Bundesbank's fiftieth anniversary by participating on this panel on "Success and Failure of Monetary Policy since the 1950s." I was reassured in my acceptance of Axel's invitation by David Laidler's survey paper, which found more successes than not over the past two decades.1  A concise summary of this success is evident in the performance of consumer price inflation in the advanced economies. Median inflation in that group (as defined by the International Monetary Fund) has held near 2 percent for this decade. Indeed, in the IMF's latest World Economic Outlook, four out of five countries in this group are expected to post inflation rates between 1 percent and 3 percent this year. That good performance has helped to anchor inflation expectations, which, in turn, generates many benefits. Anchored inflation expectations damp the pass-through of supply-related price shocks. They also permit central banks to respond more forcefully to output fluctuations. Most significantly, the improved inflation performance has come with, not at the expense of, output stability. Although a consensus has not formed on how much of the "Great Moderation" in the growth of real output can be attributed to monetary policy, everyone agrees that at least a portion of it can. David views these macroeconomic outcomes as a triumph of monetarism, but not because the formulaic policy prescription associated with that doctrine succeeded (or, for that matter, was even tried on a sustained basis). Rather, the underlying tenets of monetarism ultimately seeped into the collective central banking unconscious and fostered better decisionmaking. The beliefs that David identifies are threefold: That market economies are inherently self-righting, that open economies perform best under flexible exchange rates, and that central bankers should focus on price stability as their long-run objective.  David suggests that monetarism failed when its proponents got too prescriptive by advocating rigid rules for money growth. Among the lessons he takes from the failed monetarist experiment are that central banking is an applied science and that our imperfect understanding of how economies and markets function implies that a good dose of humility is required – and I agree. As evidence of that humility on my part, let me also agree with David that two important questions about the conduct of monetary policy have not yet been resolved. This is unfortunate because these two questions are both longstanding sources of debate and central to current policy concerns. First, what is the best way to pursue price stability, and, second, how should asset prices be taken into account in steering policy? In many countries, though not my own, the answer to the first question has been that price stability should be pursued through the formal apparatus of an inflation target, which typically includes establishing an inflation goal by the government, setting metrics to evaluate central bank performance, and periodically communicating progress to the public. Although correlation does not convey causation, the spread of such regimes has coincided with sustained low global inflation. In addition, no adopter of an inflation target has subsequently abandoned it.                                                   1  Vincent Reinhart, of the Board's staff, contributed to the preparation of these remarks. The views expressed are my own and not necessarily shared by my colleagues on the Board or the Federal Open Market Committee. BIS Review 105/2007 1 
Before anyone jumps to the conclusion that Frankfurt is a stop on my road to Damascus, let this Saul state that for me the case remains open. Inflation has come down worldwide, in countries without, as well as with, inflation targets. Moreover, I share David's puzzlement about why an explicit inflation goal should make a substantial difference in performance given the paucity of evidence showing that choosing a target directly affects the level of the public's inflation expectations. That said, I am relatively more persuaded that inflation targeting helps reduce the variance of inflation expectations. Evidence has accumulated to suggest that stock prices, interest rates, and measures of inflation expectations seem to vary less in economies in which the central bank has an explicit long-run goal for inflation.  I suspect that this better anchoring of expectations and the success of inflation targeting in many countries is attributable in part to aspects of the political economy that David identified. A formal inflation target represents a national embrace of a goal, in which elected authorities recognize the primacy of price stability and publicly support – indeed, even require – the central bank's pursuit of that goal. To the extent that elected authorities channel the desires of the electorate, a central bank directed to adopt an inflation target is being given a strong signal as to the goal's importance to the public at large. This affirmation has often been reinforced by the granting of operational independence to the central bank to achieve that goal most effectively. An important effect of such public acceptance of price stability is that it erodes the standing of those who would direct central bank action toward other ends. In such an environment, workers, businesspeople, and investors can make plans with the expectation that nominal magnitudes will be predictable and so devote their attention to more productive matters. For the European Central Bank, this framework was established by treaty. In most other instances, the adoption of an inflation target involved laws and mutual understandings, not constitutional changes. The early adopters of inflation targets were parliamentary democracies, which is not too surprising given that in such a system a single branch of government can enact laws and put them into effect. With regard to an inflation goal, the parliament can erect the formal apparatus and the finance minister can serve as the government's point of contact with the central bank.  The system in the United States is different in that two independent branches of government are responsible for economic policy making, making agreement on a single goal problematic. Moreover, those two branches have already spoken as to the appropriate aim of the nation's central bank: The Congress, in a law the President signed, has given the Federal Reserve a dual mandate that directs us to foster maximum employment and stable prices over time. This instruction is not an accident of history, in that, in the past, the Congress has shown no appetite to amend its legislation. Nor is this instruction unreasonable, in that the dual mandate has come to be interpreted as assigning us the responsibility for attaining price stability in the long run, which will bring with it maximum employment, and of being mindful of resource utilization in the succession of short runs that make up the long run. The dual mandate seems proper and fitting, given that economic costs are incurred both by having inflation stray from its long-run goal and by having output deviate from the economy's potential to produce; and it seems to produce results not too different in practice from those associated with central banks that are flexible inflation targeters.  As I said earlier, anchoring expectations has value, in that it makes planning easier, reduces resources spent on predicting and protecting against unexpected variations in nominal magnitudes, and grants a central bank greater scope to lean against fluctuations in output while keeping inflation contained. The latter is particularly attractive given our dual mandate, in that better-anchored inflation expectations could produce the win-win outcome of improving the attainment of both goals. For that reason, in its consideration of its communications strategies, the Federal Open Market Committee has been discussing whether mechanisms could be put in place that could better anchor inflation expectations in a manner consistent with the institutional framework of our dual mandate. 2 BIS Review 105/2007 
The second of David's open issues – whether central banks should lean against possible asset price bubbles – was the key topic in my discussion here eighteen months ago, at Otmar's festschrift. My answer then is my answer now. A central bank should focus on the outlook for the macroeconomy and generally relegate asset prices to the subordinate role of inputs to the forecast process. I view this as the simple application of humility that David and I find so admirable. Although economic theory provides no settled answers to any topic, its predictions are especially imprecise with regard to asset pricing, which has two implications for central bankers. First, little confidence can be attached to the determination that an asset bubble exists except in the most extreme of circumstances. Second, even less confidence can be attached to predictions of the effects of policy on asset prices, and in particular on any speculative element in those prices. Moreover, monetary policy actions addressed at a perceived bubble in one sector may have undesirable effects on other asset prices and the economy more generally. As a result, my preferred policy framework remains three pronged: First, assign the single instrument of monetary policy to its macroeconomic objective; second, rely on regulation to erect a resilient financial structure; and, third, in the event that market judgments prove to be wrong and financial prices adjust sharply, apply the tool of monetary policy to the macroeconomic task at hand. That task is not always easily captured by simple statistical regularities. Relationships between financial markets and economic results are complex and nonlinear, especially when markets are not behaving normally. When investors are ebullient, their expectations of outsized capital gains can feed on themselves and back on the economy. On the way down, investors' loss of confidence, a reduction in credit availability, and a tightening of terms and conditions for credit have the potential to have pronounced effects on activity and inflation.  The world is, no doubt, different than when we gathered here eighteen months ago. However, it is far too soon to pass judgment on what went wrong in the U.S. housing market and why. I suspect that, when studies are done with cooler reflection, the causes of the swing in house prices will be seen as less a consequence of monetary policy and more a result of the emotions of excessive optimism followed by fear experienced every so often in the marketplace through the ages. To some extent, too, the amplitude of the housing cycle was heightened by the newness of the subprime market, the fragmentation of regulatory oversight responsibility for that market, and the complexity and opacity of the newer instruments for transforming and distributing risk. Low policy interest rates early in this decade helped feed the initial rise in house prices. However, the worst excesses in the market probably occurred when short-term rates were already well on their way to more normal levels, but longer-term rates were held down by a variety of forces. And similar, sometimes even sharper, trajectories of house prices have been witnessed in some economies in which the central banks said they were paying more attention to asset prices.  The action the Federal Open Market Committee took this Tuesday can be interpreted as the application of the third leg of my preferred policy triad, in that it was taken "to forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets and promote moderate growth over time." In the past, such efforts to cushion the restraint induced by declines in asset prices have fueled the assertion that Federal Reserve policy is asymmetrical in its response to booms and busts in asset prices. Such an asymmetry is said to have the potential to feed "moral hazard" in that investors would spend less effort evaluating underlying values as they were lulled by the protection they expected to be provided by monetary policy action.  In point of fact, Federal Reserve policy makers have not been asymmetrical in intent or in actions, in that we have always focused sharply on the macroeconomy. Asset prices have mattered in the determination of policy because they have mattered for our outlook. I am confident that the federal funds rate would not have been as high in 2000 if it had not been for the level of equity prices that year, nor would the federal funds rate have been as elevated in 2006 in the absence of the tight credit spreads, low term premiums, and the BIS Review 105/2007 3 
impetus from housing wealth. And I doubt policy would have been eased this week if housing prices had continued their upward march. In each instance, however, policy was motivated not by the desire to achieve any particular level of asset prices, but rather by the Federal Reserve's assessment of how changes in asset prices were affecting the forecast of growth and inflation. I would also caution that a symmetrical response to the macroeconomic outlook will need to reflect the inherent asymmetries in business cycles. In the typical boom-bust cycle, asset prices tend to rise relatively gradually over a protracted period but fall sharply in a shorter stretch of time, which financial economists refer to as "rising by the escalator and falling by the elevator." Perhaps because those asset prices are important to spending, key macroeconomic indicators, such as the unemployment rate, exhibit a similar pattern. It is not surprising then that a macro-focused monetary policy will leave an asymmetric footprint in the data.  In the end, my humble advice is to evaluate policymakers relative to the tasks the law has given them. In my judgment, the record over the past twenty-five years of steady growth with two mild recessions and gradually declining inflation to a reasonably low level does not betray an asymmetry in our policy responses in the metric that counts – macroeconomic performance. 4 BIS Review 105/2007 
Jean Claude Trichet: Fiftieth anniversary of the Deutsche Bundesbank Short address by Mr Jean Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, at the Gala Dinner for the 50th anniversary of the Bundesbank, Frankfurt am Main, 20 September 2007. *      *      * Sehr geehrte Frau Bundeskanzlerin, Sehr geehrter Herr Minister Präsident, Sehr geehrte Frau Oberbürgermeisterin, Sehr geehrter Bundesbank Präsident,  Sehr geehrte Kollegen der Bundesbank, dear colleagues of the Eurosystem, Dear guests, ladies and gentlemen,  It is a great pleasure for me to celebrate with you this evening the 50th anniversary of the Deutsche Bundesbank.  The year 1957 was marked by a number of events that should subsequently prove to be major milestones in the areas of technological, institutional and economic development: the launch of the first artificial satellite, the signature of the Treaty of Rome, and the foundation of the Deutsche Bundesbank. At the time, I was a teenager and I have to confess that I very closely followed only the first event. Since then I had the privilege to appreciate the immense historical importance of the Treaty of Rome for peace and prosperity on our continent. With regard to the Bundesbank, I think that it is fair to say that its foundation provided not only Europe but also the rest of the world with a very good example, and indeed a role model, of central banking.  The trademarks of this role model are monetary stability, independence and credibility. The Bundesbank has embodied them from its inception, and, today, they are recognised all over the world as essential for monetary policy to deliver price stability and, in this way, to support sustained economic growth and job creation. J’ai eu moi-même l’honneur d’être pendant dix ans le gouverneur de la Banque de France indépendante par la volonté du peuple français, depuis le 1er janvier 1994, avant de passer le témoin au gouverneur Noyer. Et je ne peux dissimuler la fierté qui a été la nôtre quand nous avons pu démontrer à nos concitoyens que le mandat premier de la stabilité des prix – que la Banque de France avait défini dès janvier 1994 comme étant moins de 2 % - associé à la pleine indépendance, nous permettaient au bout de quatre ans de supprimer toute prime de risque entre le franc francais et le deutschemark. C’était, avec les résultats également remarquables des autres banques centrales nationales, une contribution décisive à la création de la monnaie unique.  Independence from executive branches is an essential feature of the institutional framework for a successful monetary policy as it allows the central bank to pursue its primary objective and to take full responsibility for its actions. The legal and institutional framework of the Bundesbank has been decisive in this respect, but equally important has been the quality of its staff and leadership. I have had the very great privilege to know and work closely with five of the Bundesbank’s Presidents – Karl-Otto Pöhl, Helmut Schlesinger, Hans Tietmeyer, Ernst Welteke and Axel Weber – and with Board members, in particular Otmar Issing and Jürgen Stark at both the Bundesbank and the ECB, as well as with the many excellent professionals committed to fulfilling the mission of this important institution.  The clear objective of price stability and the independence from executive branches, however, only necessary conditions for the success of the Bundesbank as an institution. The additional and decisive condition has been the credibility it gained with the German people and with global financial markets. Credibility is not something that can be installed by decree, it has to be earned. The strong determination of the German people to keep the value of their money stable on a lasting basis had initially provided the Bundesbank with a broad constituency that shared this conviction about importance of price stability and its task “to BIS Review 104/2007 1 
safeguard the currency”, or “die Währung zu sichern” as it says in the Bundesbank Act. As the vivid memory of the hyperinflation faded and price stability was achieved, the Bundesbank’s credibility – fostered by a broad-based and intensive communication with all parts of society – was essential to protect its independence and rebuff any temptations to relax the notion of price stability.  Ich möchte Sie daran erinnern, dass Preisstabilität und Zentralbankunabhängigkeit tatsächlich Tag für Tag verteidigt werden müssen, da sie immer wieder auf die Probe gestellt werden: 1956, noch vor der formellen Gründung der Bundesbank, forderte Bundeskanzler Adenauer, man solle die Erhöhung der Leitzinssätze um ganze 100 Basispunkte verschieben. Die deutsche Zentralbank ließ sich jedoch nicht darauf ein und überzeugte die deutsche Bevölkerung von ihrer Politik sowie davon, dass sie dafür sorgen würde, dass der Geldwert erhalten bleibt. In den folgenden 50 Jahren gab es viele weitere Herausforderungen: das Ende des Bretton-Woods-Systems, größere Ölkrisen, die Wiedervereinigung, die Grundlagen des Europäischen Währungssystems sowie die Vorbereitungen zur Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion – um nur einige zu nennen. Allen diesen Herausforderungen begegnete die Bundesbank mit Souveränität und festen Grundsätzen. Als Präsident der erstmals unabhängigen Banque de France bin ich stolz darauf, dass ich gemeinsam mit Vertretern der Bundesbank an der Vorbereitung der Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion – auf der Grundlage des vorrangigen Auftrags der Preisstabilität und der klaren Unabhängigkeit der EZB von politischer Einflussnahme – mitwirken konnte. Die Formulierung des Vertrags und die Zusammenarbeit mit den Hauptakteuren auf deutscher Seite habe ich als besonders bereichernd empfunden. Diese Persönlichkeiten haben entscheidend zur Gestaltung und zum Funktionieren des Maastricht-Vertrags beigetragen. Hier möchte ich auf jeden Fall Horst Köhler, den jetzigen Bundespräsidenten, erwähnen, mit dem meine Kollegen und ich den Vertrag von Maastricht verhandelt haben. Heute genieße ich das Privileg, mit der Bundesbank als Mitglied des Eurosystems zusammenzuarbeiten, das in vollem Umfang zum Erfolg des europäischen Währungsteams und zur Erfüllung unseres Auftrags, die Preisstabilität zu gewährleisten, beiträgt. Fünfzig Jahre mag von einigen als fortgeschrittenes Alter empfunden werden, aber für eine erfolgreiche Institution wie die Bundesbank ist dieses Jubiläum kein Grund zur Wehmut, sondern stellt eine Auszeichnung dar. Die Werte und Beiträge, die die Bundesbank in das Eurosystem einbringt, sind jung wie eh und je.  Herzlichen Glückwunsch! Ich möchte Dir, Axel, und Deiner Institution meinen Dank und meine Freundschaft aussprechen! 2 BIS Review 104/2007 
Tarisa Watanagase: Thailand’s economic outlook and challenges under the volatile financial environment Keynote address by Dr Tarisa Watanagase, Governor of the Bank of Thailand, at the International Herald Tribune and Citigold Wealth Management Economic Forum 2007, Bangkok, 19 September 2007. *      *      * Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a pleasure to be here today to give a keynote address at the economic forum hosted by the International Herald Tribune and the CitiGold Wealth Management. I also like to thank the hosts for this important opportunity to share with you my perspectives on the Thai economy moving forward, especially in the global environment of greater financial volatility and uncertainties. I believe that the media, local and international, provides a very important two-way avenue for the central bank to communicate our views and the rationale underlying our policies to the public at large, and to receive feedbacks, positive as well as negative. The topic of my talk today is “Thailand’s Economic Outlook and Challenges under the Volatile Financial Environment.” I will divide my address into three parts. First, I would like to highlight the key risks stemming from the recent global developments and outlook. In this connection, I would briefly touch on the implications of the US sub-prime market on the Thai economy. Second, I like to focus on recent key economic developments in Thailand and the outlook for 2008. I will then discuss the risks and challenges facing the Thai economy, especially those relating to volatile international capital movements and their impact on the Thai baht in the short term and in building resiliency and enhancing productivity for the long-term. Ladies and Gentlemen, Let me start with the global picture. For a number of years now, we have witnessed strong global growth driven mainly by growth in the US economy and in emerging markets, particularly non-Japan Asia. During this same period, we have also seen growing global imbalances with the rest of the world financing the US’s growing current account deficits. There is yet no consensus on how this global financial imbalance will unwind, but everyone expects that a large dollar correction will be part of the unwinding process, which will impact on financial markets and exchange rates worldwide. My view is that we are likely to see more market jitters along the unwinding process of this global imbalance. Indeed, for the last couple years, we have already experienced large magnitude of capital fluctuations and exchange rate volatilities. This year alone, we have observed two episodes, in February and again in August, of the shift toward greater risk aversions, with sharp falls in the stock markets across the world, from New York to Shanghai, and Bangkok included.  At this juncture, there seems to be an increasing disconnect between global growth and financial stability. On the one hand, the global economy has continued and is expected to expand robustly, driven mainly by strong growth in the euro area and the emerging market economies, particularly China and India. Financial stability has, on the other hand, become more vulnerable than a few years ago. Recent developments in the US economy and sub-prime credit markets may indeed be an early wake-up call for policymakers and market players worldwide. The US sub-prime related problem has prompted a retrenchment from risky assets and de-leveraging, causing wider credit spreads for riskier assets classes and higher volatilities in bond and equity markets BIS Review 104/2007 1 
around the world. The unwinding of carry-trade and flight to quality of international capital have also been observed. Importantly, the resulting disruption has already required extraordinary liquidity injections by a number of central banks to smooth market fluctuations. Beside the financial sector, turmoil in the sub-prime markets also posed negative impact on the real sector, denting US growth prospects going forward. I would like to digress briefly to tell you that the direct exposures of Thai financial institutions in collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) are relatively minimal, in terms of shares of their total assets. I also like to reassure you that we are keeping vigilance on potential indirect repercussion that may arise further from the impacts of US sub-prime markets to the global economy and financial markets, as the adjustment process is likely to be protracted. Moreover, we will have to wait and see how the US economy responds to the latest rate cut by the Fed. In sum, the external risks facing the Thai economy have been tilted more towards financial volatility rather than growth at this point. Ladies and gentlemen, I have highlighted to you the risks that may likely emanate from the external front. But as recent developments in the Thai economy stemmed also from internal factors, this brings me to the second part of my talk, which is the recent key developments in Thailand and the outlook for 2008. This year, even though Thailand’s growth rate has underperformed those of our peers in the region, I still consider GDP growth of around 4-5 percent, which is expected for the whole of 2007, quite satisfactory. Notwithstanding the baht appreciation, Thai exports have expanded well and remained the main engine of growth this year. Our exporters have also successfully penetrated new markets to compensate the falling demand from the traditional market, namely the US. Much of the extent of growth underperformance in comparison to our regional peers has been accounted for by slower domestic demand. Over a year-long political uncertainty led to weak consumer confidence and an unfavourable investment climate. I am hopeful that once the general election date is scheduled and the cloud of political uncertainty has lifted, consumer confidence would rebound. In line with the consumption recovery, I also expect investment to pick up and play a stronger role as growth driver, to promote a more balanced economy. In this regard, greater clarity about the large public investment projects will be crucial in putting both public and private investment back on track. The continued high capacity utilization and investment promotion applications to the Board of Investment have pointed to stronger appetite for investment once the investment climate becomes more favourable. During this period of uncertainties, monetary policy has become more accommodative in line with declining inflation and low risks of picking up going forward. Latest data for August showed headline inflation at 1.1 percent and core inflation at 0.7 percent. Set in this light, the Monetary Policy Committee cut its policy interest rate in total by 175 basis points since the beginning of this year. The aim is to stimulate the domestic demand to offset the expected slower export growth in light of the slower US economy and baht appreciation, though exports still remains an important driver of growth for next year. Latest economic forecast projects the economic growth to lie between 4.5-6.0 per cent in 2008, while core inflation is expected to stay comfortably around 1.0-2.0 percent. Given the appreciation trend of the Thai baht thus far, we cannot deny that certain industries, especially those who rely more on the high local content materials, have been affected far more than those who rely more on the import-content materials. Though such deterioration in 2 BIS Review 104/2007 
price competitiveness has been expected for some times, we have not seen real sector adjustments keeping up with the pace of changes in financial environment. For those waiting to hear about the exchange rate trend, I will have to disappoint you as always. I would just like to say that, given the current inflation targeting framework, monetary policy can take care of exchange rate as long as there is no conflict with inflation. And, we have no target level for the Thai baht in mind. Foreign exchange market is intervened when there is too much volatility in the market. The objective is to smooth the country’s adjustment during the transitional period. Looking forward, the baht movement would depend largely on external developments which I have already discussed. Moreover, there are also internal drivers: large surplus in current and capital accounts. The Thai stock market remains one of the most popular destinations in emerging markets for foreign investors, given its relatively low P/E ratio. During the first 7 months of this year, foreign investors became net buy about 4 billion US dollar. Such inflows together with foreign direct investments have also added pressure on the currency. Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to turn to the third and final part of my talk today, which is Thailand’s approach in coping with the risks and challenges posed by globalization. Indeed, the challenges of globalization are constantly changing. To meet these challenges from without, it is critical that the Thai economy build strength from within: by continuously improving the flexibility and efficiency of its firms, the resiliency of its households, and the competitiveness of its business environment. But beyond getting the fundamentals right and strengthening them, the Thai economy needs a strategic policy package that builds a system that allows for constant self-correction – one that also let the economy regain its strength quickly after a severe negative shock. That system should be underpinned by a strong link to the world economy, which will encourage innovation and efficiency. Specifically, I should underscore that this approach requires policy markers to focus on achieving three key objectives, namely managing volatilities especially those emanating from volatile global capital movements; building resiliency in both real and financial sectors; and fostering long-term productivity improvement. Looking ahead, the pressing and practical challenges we face in the near term are three-fold and indeed they are also inter-related. They are “hot money” inflows and large inflows in general, pressure for rapid domestic currency appreciation, and finally, the potential loss of monetary autonomy in the sense of independent interest rate policy. Being part of the fast growing Asia, Thailand and its neighbors have become attractive destinations for international investors – although the more powerful underlying reason may ironically be a medium-term flight from US dollar assets since 2002. With large capital inflow comes pressure for these currencies to appreciate. In this experience, some currencies appreciate faster than others. In fact, those that surrender most of their monetary autonomy or maintain restrictions on cross-border capital flows need not feel immediate pressure to appreciate. But those that have come further along the liberalization road have to face a different kind of challenge. In our case, the Bank of Thailand has sought a balanced approach to managing capital flows under flexible exchange rate. We also undertake concomitant reforms in the area of financial system and market development. These initiatives are closely related and progress in one requires progress in the others. In building a resilient economy, prudent fiscal and monetary policy does help. As an automatic stabilizer, flexible exchange rate also helps. BIS Review 104/2007 3 
Ladies and Gentlemen, Hot money, or indeed large inflows in general, can fuel asset prices and encourage excessive risk-taking behavior. Central banks may wish to counter that excess in the interest of financial stability. If the central bank chooses to maintain a high interest rate stance, the pressure on the currency to appreciate will likely mount. Since these challenges require significant ability for the domestic economy to adjust flexibly, the solution package we seek must help reduce the distortions in our economies. Allowing the competitive pressure and incentive to operate is undoubtedly the best way to foster investment in physical and human capital, as well as innovation and risk-taking, all of which are crucial to long-term productivity growth. They are also crucial for a flexible and resilient economy. But policy and regulations still have a role to play. The imperative here is to improve on policy and regulation design that can help deal with market excesses. Building on the spirit of entrepreneurship, the real sector must work continuously to improve its competitiveness by strengthening productivity. A sustained rise in wages and living standards cannot take place without productivity growth. And adaptability to the shifting winds of global competition cannot happen without the ability to adopt the best technology and the ability to use that technology efficiently. To this end, the best competition policy for Thailand is policy to encourage competition. Encouraging competition means open markets. Open markets give firms the means and the incentive to invest, innovate and learn to be the best. As regards the financial sector, Thailand not only requires stronger financial intermediaries but also market players of different views and risk appetites to ensure that the markets and financial system will undergo constant self-correction. Access to deeper and more liquid capital markets is another crucial element of financial development going forward.  At this juncture, our own financial markets may not be deep enough soon enough, but some domestic players who are ready for it should not be encumbered from having access to the world financial markets. Indeed, those who can manage the risks have benefited from liberalized inflows in the past, but the Thai economy may benefit more if its citizens can unload domestic systematic risk abroad. To this end, the Bank of Thailand has progressively pursued capital account liberalization on the outflow side. Outflow for portfolio investment was first permitted in 2003. Since the beginning of this year, we have expanded the limits of Thai direct investment and portfolio investment abroad. To promote more balanced-capital movements, further liberalization measures, including the relaxation of FX holdings by juristic persons and individuals, were implemented during the last two months, and we are currently monitoring their impact on capital outflows. Indeed, the appropriate degree of financial openness through time is a controversial issue. Key is the right pacing and sequencing of capital account liberalization. It is also important to underline the fact that big market events that pose systemic risks tend to reflect collective mistakes in which most market participants are offside in the same direction. In this regard, capital control measures can be useful tools for reducing the chance of prolonged financial misalignment with economic fundamentals. Ladies and Gentlemen, The Thai financial landscape is changing. Therefore, it is our goal to ensure that our regulatory and supervisory responses keep pace with the financial intermediaries and the products they offer. In this endeavor, the Bank of Thailand has put emphasis on robust stress testing, enhanced counterparty risk management, and safe and efficient market infrastructures. Our financial and legal infrastructures will continue to be strengthened particularly through the introduction of a number of legislations and amendments. The new Deposit Insurance Act and the Financial Institutions Act are in the pipeline. Specifically, the 4 BIS Review 104/2007 
latter Act will stipulate prompt corrective action and grant the Bank of Thailand power to conduct supervision on a consolidated basis. The current Financial Sector Master Plan (FSMP) will move into its second phase, with an emphasis on increased competition and consideration on potential entry of new players to further enhance financial efficiency and resiliency. Our accession to the Basel II accord will upgrade the risk management of banks to the best standard and will further enhance financial sector stability. Ladies and Gentlemen, To end my talk today, I would like to emphasize that policymakers must avoid misplacing the focus of policies just on short-term issues. They must instead always weigh very carefully between short-term and long-term objectives toward achieving strengthened resiliency of the overall economy. Only with such resiliency, will a small open economy like Thailand be able to sail through the waves of global financial turbulence in the years ahead. BIS Review 104/2007 5 
Rakesh Mohan: Recent financial market developments and implications for monetary policy Valedictory address by Dr Rakesh Mohan, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the Institute of International Finance’s inaugural Asia Regional Economic Forum, Mumbai, 20 September 2007. Assistance of M.D. Patra and Indranil Bhattacharya in preparing the speech is gratefully acknowledged.  *      *      * Shri Bhatt, Mr Horiguchi, Ladies and Gentlemen, I am honoured to be invited to deliver the valedictory address at the Asia Regional Economic Forum. The relationship between India and the Institute of International Finance (IIF) goes back a long way to the early 1990s. Therefore, it is only befitting that the IIF has chosen to inaugurate the Asia Regional Economic Forum in Mumbai as an opportunity for the informal exchange of ideas and views on the region and the global economy, with emphasis on key issues relating to India. I observe from the proceedings of the forum that there has been a timely focus on and comprehensive coverage of developments in global and regional financial and commodity markets, the financial system at large and issues relevant for emerging Asia.  Over the last two months, a good deal of our collective attention has been focused on the turmoil in financial markets in the United States and Europe and the sudden plunge in credit market confidence triggered by emerging risks to exposures to the US sub-prime mortgage crisis. Even as every passing day unravels a little more of the underlying forces at work – the complex nature of the derivatives used; the high degree of leveraging on poor, light or even absent collateral; the underestimation of risk pervading financial markets; the surprisingly sizeable exposures of large financial institutions to some of the debt instruments and derivatives in question; and the speed of contagion – I believe that we still have to travel much further before we understand the full import of these recent events in terms of both information and analysis. Consequently, there is considerable uncertainty surrounding both debt and credit markets as of now. Quite justifiably, regulators, monetary authorities and finance ministries are all engaged in containing the risks posed by these developments. In my address, I thought I would take this opportunity to stand back from the actual play of events and try to gain an understanding of the nature of the turbulence, why it happened, where it happened, and the implications for central banks. In the rest of my address, I will reflect on some overarching forces that led up to and characterized the recent spate of events, the specific responses of central banks and some challenges that are likely to face them as the future unfolds.  I. What is going on? Perhaps the most defining feature of the global economy over the last three decades has been what has been termed as the “Great Moderation” – the sustained decline in inflation and in inflation volatility. A comparison of the period since the Asian financial crisis i.e., 1998-2007 and the 30 years preceding the crisis (1970-97) shows that in the recent period, inflation (CPI) in advanced economies has averaged 1.9 per cent, down from 5.8 per cent in the earlier period. Over the same period, inflation in developing economies declined from 31.0 per cent to 7.0 per cent. Over the same time span, inflation volatility measured in terms of coefficient of variation has fallen from 0.55 to 0.20 in advanced economies and from 0.54 to 0.32 in developing economies. Consequently, average nominal interest rates (LIBOR rates on the US dollar) have also moderated from 8.3 per cent in the previous period to 3.8 per cent in the recent period. This feature has also been reflected in some decline in real interest rates as well, from 2.5 per cent to 1.9 per cent. The secular lowering of nominal and real BIS Review 104/2007 1 
interest rates across the world has enhanced the appetite for risk even as pricing of risk has become increasingly difficult.  The second important feature of recent global developments which could have had a direct bearing on the current crisis is the role of monetary policy. Since the technology stocks meltdown in 2000, there has been significant monetary accommodation by the major economies – the US, Euro area and Japan – and it is estimated that between one-half and two-thirds of US currency supply is held outside the US. Growth in monetary aggregates has been higher than the rates of growth that would have been expected hitherto in relation to real economic growth. Yet inflation has been contained at low levels. There is evidence of abundant excess liquidity in financial markets which is also reflected in the macro imbalances between the US and Asia. Consequently, there have been sizeable currency misalignments and carry trades, compression of risk spreads, mispricing of widely diffused risks and even real sector implications for several emerging economies. The strong macroeconomic performance of Asia has also contributed to the relentless search for yields and the increasing appetite for risk. In fact, in the annual economic symposium on “Housing, Housing Finance and Monetary Policy” held by the Federal Reserve of Kansas City at Jackson Hole during August 30-September 1, 2007, Professor John Taylor (of Taylor rule fame) argued that the Fed had followed an excessively loose monetary policy between 2002-2006.  The combination of sustained low inflation accompanied by accommodative monetary policy worldwide could have generated excessive confidence in the ability of central banks and monetary policy to keep inflation rates and interest rates low indefinitely, leading to under pricing of risk and hence excessive risk taking. This result is analogous to the excessive foreign borrowing undertaken by private sector borrowers and banks in East Asian countries when exchange rates were seen as relatively fixed, and hence their risk perceptions were low. It may be ironic that the perceived success of central banks and increased credibility of monetary policy, giving rise to enhanced expectations with regard to stability in both inflation and interest rates, could have led to the mispricing of risk and hence enhanced risk taking. Yet another view is that more than success or failure of central banks, the repeated assurances of stability and guidance to markets about the future path of interest rates, coupled with the availability of ample liquidity was an invitation to markets to underprice risks. This view, consequently, puts the blame on those central banks who failed to give space to markets to assess risks by eschewing surprise elements in policy. It is possible that with increased globalisation resulting in the containment of prices of tradable goods during this period and hence of measured inflation, the excess liquidity has shown up in elevated asset prices worldwide, along with increased cross border capital flows in search of yields. Easy monetary policy itself may have generated a search for yields that resulted in a dilution of standards in assessing credit risk. The desirability of using monetary policy tools, and judgements regarding the adequacy of such tools, to meet asset price movements is yet another relevant factor in this regard, in so far as most central banks did not address this issue. As some withdrawal of monetary accommodation commenced in response to perceived or visible inflationary pressures, the sub-prime crisis revealed these vulnerabilities starkly as confidence plunged, markets froze and triggered off panic among investors and lenders regarding their inability to value complex risky assets and structured derivative products. With the deterioration in credit confidence, banks have been forced to advance loans to their off-balance sheet "special investment vehicles (SIVs)" which uses up their capital thereby rendering other borrowers credit constrained.  Thus, it can be argued that it is the combination of low real and nominal interest rates brought about by the lowering of inflation, accompanied by the abundance of liquidity induced by accommodative monetary policy which lies at the roots of the current crisis. In this sense, the sub-prime is a symptom rather than a cause. Arguably, the outcome could have been quite different if, for instance, interest rates declined on the back of ebbing inflation but there was no accommodation in monetary policy and therefore no excess liquidity.  2 BIS Review 104/2007 
Whereas this view has been put forward by many commentators and analysts, there is also a persuasive opposite view, as best articulated by Alan Greenspan in a recent interview on the occasion of the release of his book (Financial Times, September 17, 2007). He argues that the great moderation in inflation could be attributed to real economy phenomenon in addition to any monetary policy measures. First, the long run of productivity growth that has been observed in the US in the late 1990s and till recently in this decade has clearly been an important factor dampening inflation. Second, globalization and the addition of a billion new workers in China and India have dampened wage growth worldwide and hence inflation. Whereas he agrees that the fall in long term rates provided the initial gain in house prices, he does not accept that these low long term interest rates can be attributed to the extended US Fed policy of low policy interest rates. As evidence, he points to the absence of any effect on long term interest rates when short term policy interest rates were indeed raised. So the jury is out on the extent of monetary policy effects on extended long term interest rates and hence elevated housing prices. As an aside, it will be interesting to explore as to whether the low interest rate regime was fully justified. Critics argue that the Fed should have tried harder, raising rates sooner and faster. In his response, Mr. Greenspan is quoted in the Financial Times (September 17, 2007) as saying that such a policy response would not have been acceptable "to the political establishment" given the very low rate of inflation and "the presumption that we were fully independent and have full discretion was false". One issue that confronts us is why has the turmoil originated in the credit market and then spread to money markets and debt markets with such great rapidity. It is widely understood that the credit market is characterized by information asymmetry. Borrowers have much greater information on their own credit quality than do the lenders and it is this asymmetry that has traditionally meant that the creditor has to have an enduring relationship with the borrower so that his or her credit quality can be monitored on a continuous basis. Banks therefore have traditionally had to invest considerable resources in performing this function. They have had the incentive to do so since they had borne the credit risk on their books. However, in many countries, from being originators of loans and bearers of risk, banks have become mere originators of loans and distributors of risk, because the traditional view of the role of banks has changed considerably in recent years. First, the availability of information technology has reduced the cost of information collection and maintenance considerably. Thus, a widespread belief has arisen that information on credit quality of small borrowers who may be widely dispersed across jurisdictions can be made impersonal, packaged, processed, and sold. Second, with the availability of such technology, and the belief that such information was available on a structured basis, a great deal of financial innovation could take place which essentially enabled the investor or risk taker to become progressively remote from the ultimate borrowers where the actual risks lay. A whole host of intermediaries in the form of mortgage brokers, mortgage companies, societies and the like were then able to package their mortgage assets including non conforming loans and sell down to different categories of investors, including Special Investment Vehicles (SIVs), hedge funds and the like, most of whom were not regulated. The guiding principle behind this activity was that it is feasible for credit rating agencies to have enough information on a continuous basis to rate the instruments that had been packaged. It can certainly be argued that this is not a new development since mortgage backed securities (MBS) and asset backed securities (ABS) have been with us for some time and have been successful in providing liquidity to credit markets on a continuous basis without any accidents. The difference perhaps is that MBS packaged by the government sponsored entities (GSEs) were subject to certain relatively well enforced norms that presumably reduced the potential risk embedded in these instruments. These considerations lead to the third set of issues that relate to the role of effective financial regulation and supervision. Has the recent crisis underscored the need for strengthening of oversight of advanced financial markets? Traditionally, financial surveillance has placed relatively more emphasis on banking regulation. Banks are highly leveraged financial entities who are also effective trustees of public money by virtue of holding deposits. Hence, they BIS Review 104/2007 3 
have to be effectively regulated and supervised in order to maintain public confidence in the banking system and depositors have to be protected from excessive risk-taking by banks. On the other hand, investors in hedge funds are high net worth individuals who do not need such protection. They are informed investors who are able to exploit the information efficiency of markets and, therefore, should be able to understand the risks implied by information asymmetry. The current crisis was, however, triggered by the difficulties encountered by these investors who had taken large exposures to sub-prime related investments without having accounted for the potential risks embedded in these instruments. There have been a host of ills underlying these transactions, which are now coming to light. We need, however, to abstract from the details of all the malpractices that have led to the current situation and reflect on the incentive structure that led to these malpractices. In the event, even bank depositors have got exposed and as soon as information asymmetries became evident and credit ratings came to be regarded as inadequate, markets got frozen resulting in illiquidity for banks and erosion in depositor confidence with its consequential impact on financial markets, and monetary policy. The links between banks and non bank financial intermediaries, and other off balance sheet exposures were not adequately recognised or recorded by banking supervisors. In the context of recent events, it is important to recognise that there is a need to understand better the process of transmission of risk information through various segments of the financial markets in order to address the crisis of collateral in the credit market. How much of the specialized information that rests with lenders can be systematized, packaged and transmitted to markets as credit ratings. The principle underlying securitisation is based on the lender having this specialized information which can be unbundled and sold in the market separately in tradable sizes. A large part of the market for structured finance products is over the counter. Can these products be further standardized so that they can be traded on an exchange which enables greater transparency from the point of view of the investor? Are there better ways of generating more objective information on the market value of collaterals, especially in situations where collaterals are not fully marked to market since such information may not be available on ongoing basis? Are there limits to marking to market certain kinds of assets whose values are not available on a high frequency basis?  Changes in housing prices are dependent on a whole vector of factors, ranging from changes in local zoning and land laws, demand and supply balances in local areas, to changes in monetary policy. It is difficult to devise land price or housing price systems that are high frequency enough to transmit quickly through credit ratings and the like. However, improvements could be envisaged in terms of reforms in the land pricing systems, improvements in the functioning of laws and procedures for foreclosure, bankruptcy and rehabilitation. Efficient functioning of such processes and functioning of legal systems is essential if collateral is to have a marketable value that is observable and hence susceptible to systemization in terms of information that can then become transparent. When the presumed value behind collateral is not either observable or realizable, securitization markets break down. And this is what seems to have happened in financial markets today.  The lesson of the current financial market crisis goes both ways. On the one hand, market innovation has indeed helped in bringing financial markets closer to those who need credit and did not have access to it earlier. Despite all the problems associated with sub-prime borrowers, it must be recognized that almost 10 million borrowers benefited from this market and were enabled access to housing finance, which had not been deemed possible earlier. With about 20 per cent of these borrowers reported to be delinquent, and in difficulty, it still means that about 8 million people clearly benefited from this market. On the other hand, the difficulties encountered draw attention to the kind of issues that can arise when the speed of innovation and incentive structures are flawed such that malpractices occur, and intrinsic difficulties arise in capturing and commoditizing information that is perhaps not yet susceptible to such commoditization.  4 BIS Review 104/2007 
From our point of view, we need to recognise the positive contributions that financial innovations make to enhance the efficiency of financial intermediation. At the same time, the Reserve Bank considers, in a dynamic setting, appropriate safeguards to ensure stability, taking account of the prevailing governance standards, risk management systems and incentive frameworks in the foreign, public, private and cooperative banks as also related non-banks. Overall, these progressive but cautious policies have contributed to both efficiency and stability of the financial system and enables current growth momentum in an environment of macro stability. II.  Response of the monetary authorities A key question that has emerged from the current developments in financial markets relates to the role of monetary authorities in the context of such a crisis. This issue is of concern to all of us in central banking. Over the last decade or two, it would appear that the focus of central banks has been narrowing relative to the more complex responsibilities that they have traditionally shouldered. A great deal has been written on this issue, a great deal has changed in terms of practices and, in some countries, the regulatory structure itself has been altered to move central banks to being relatively pure monetary authorities. According to this view, central banks should focus largely on keeping inflation low and stable, and in doing this also contribute to financial stability. To quote Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff: “Indeed many economists believe that central bankers could perfectly well be replaced with a computer programmed to implement a simple rule that adjusts interest rates in response to output and inflation. But while [this] view is theoretically rigorous, reality is not” (Businessworld, September 17, 2007) Although some central banks, such as the US Federal Reserve, have an explicit mandate to also promote growth, a good deal of thinking in recent times tends to argue that inflation control by itself would promote growth and that central banks would be better off to concentrate on this objective alone.  It is instructive to examine what central banks have done in the current context. The responses of the central banks to the recent events in financial markets have shown that concerns for financial stability can assume overriding importance, irrespective of the legislative mandate handed down to central banks as part of ongoing reforms. This is evident in the fact that central banks initially reacted by the injection of liquidity, including through special facilities and the expansion of eligible securities for collateral, rather than through interest rate cuts. Discussions involving central bankers in various fora indicate their willingness to consider other courses of action in favour of protecting growth. As we all know, the US Federal Reserve has gone further this week in cutting interest rates to promote both growth and in the interest of financial stability. And the U.K. authorities have had to provide liquidity to a specific institution, while giving a blanket guarantee to depositors on the safety of their deposits. Accordingly, it is becoming evident that central banks do have a role beyond inflation targeting. Evidently, both growth and financial stability matter for central banks.  When it comes to the crunch, in their roles as lenders of last resort (LOLR), and in discharging their responsibilities as the guardians of financial stability, they do need to perform functions that are more complex. Should central banks be lenders of last resort to the system as a whole by injecting systemic liquidity through open market operations only, or should they also provide liquidity to individual financial institutions that are judged to be solvent but illiquid? How do they arrive at such judgments if they do not have adequate information on individual institutions? Can they have such detailed information without ongoing responsibilities for regulation and supervision? This issue is not dissimilar, in terms of the existence of asymmetric information to that of the problem of adequate transparency of information related to the value of collateral underlying asset backed securities.  Banks and financial institutions are typically highly leveraged institutions: thus judgements related to their solvency depend on the valuation of their assets at the time when difficulties BIS Review 104/2007 5 
arise. In the current case, banks have invested through a chain of vehicles in securities whose values are in doubt. When providing LOLR liquidity support, how is the central bank to make a judgement on the solvency of institutions to whom it is providing liquidity? As a greater recognition and appreciation of the appropriate role of central banks gains ground, it is possible that this will result in further rethinking on the functioning of central banks. A case in point is the separation of financial regulation and supervision from monetary policy which could have resulted in ineffective and inadequate surveillance in the context of the current crisis. There is a view that problems of information asymmetry might have got further aggravated with banks reporting both to the monetary authority and the regulatory body in charge of banking supervision.  In reviewing the evolution of central banks, one is struck by the constant evolutionary change that they have undergone over time, and the differences in their functions across different countries. Their functions have changed almost continuously in response to evolving circumstances. In fact, it is the occurrence of financial instability that led to the formation of some central banks, most notably, the founding of the US Federal Reserve after the 1907 financial crisis in the United States. Thus, it will be interesting to see how thinking evolves as a result of the current crisis. Reams are already being written in the thoughtful financial press and much more is to come. We had begun to forget the danger of contagion and the speed with which it takes place when it does occur. The current developments which began in a relatively minor segment of the financial market, viz., the sub-prime mortgage segment, have spread far and wide across continents. Similarly, problems arising in one financial institution have led to the suspicion of similar problems in other institutions leading to conditions similar to bank runs. The smooth running of banks, financial institutions and financial markets depends crucially on trust and credibility along with the availability of transparent information. Hence the legitimate role of central banks in maintaining financial stability can inevitably lead to unconventional actions that do indeed restore financial stability when there is a probability of the opposite taking place. What is most instructive in the current crisis is that small problems or problems in small institutions can cause financial instability through contagion. In this context, things do not appear to have changed much for a century. The 1907 financial panic that also travelled across continents started with difficulties in a relatively small New York financial institution, the Knickerbocker Trust Company! Systemic risks do not necessarily originate in institutions judged to be too big to fail. III.  Assessment of the future At the current juncture, the likely evolution of the current financial market turmoil and its implications for the future has evoked mixed assessments. On one plane, the spread of contagion is drawing considerable concern, first, in view of the level of leverage; and second, on account of the nature of the vehicles that have created the leverage. On another plane, there is a view that turbulence would be restricted to the credit market and its impact on consumer spending and overall economic growth may be muted as credit worthiness would remain intact if, for instance, leveraged mortgage backed securities are held to maturity and not sold in distress.  First, according to the IMF’s assessment, the systemic consequences of the turmoil are likely to be manageable with the fundamentals supporting strong global growth. The repricing of credit risks that is underway is a healthy correction and should not lead to a more serious market crash. The IMF expects that the reestablishment of credit discipline due to the recent prompt action by a number of central banks should help to ensure that the adjustment process occurs in an orderly manner. Long term investors tend to support this view. The ongoing flight to quality (US Treasuries) and into global equity funds suggests a continuing faith in strong fundamentals of the global economy.  6 BIS Review 104/2007 
Second, recent developments carry implications in the form of heightened market discipline and a stricter regulation of financial markets. Investors who relied on credit ratings of Collateralised Debt Obligations (CDOs) and Collateralised Loans Obligations (CLOs) are likely to question the value of ratings in other markets. Moreover, leveraged buy-out activity is likely to wind down. While this could cause worries about equity valuations, it is expected that such concerns would eventually recede so long as corporate profitability remains strong. Furthermore, it is argued that carry trade, which has been a source of financial flows, may moderate and may even go through an abrupt unwinding and this would help in maintaining global financial stability.  In this vein, it is also argued that the recent developments will have a positive impact on the outlook for EMEs as a consequence of the diversification of portfolios of international investors and would further incentivise the maintenance of good macroeconomic policies in these countries. At the current juncture, it is expected that the fall out from the US sub prime crisis is likely to be limited for Asian banks and can easily be accommodated within their current rating positions. According to Moody’s, exposures of Asian banks have book values that do not exceed 10-35 per cent of annual pre-tax pre-provision profits. The mortgage backed securities and CDO tranches held by these banks are usually senior and therefore losses, if at all, would be substantially below 100 per cent. The bulk of foreign currency investments by Asian banks (barring those in Japan, China, Korea and Singapore) continue to be in highly rated government and corporate bonds. Policy makers need to work with rather than against the grain of markets by continuing to enable financial innovations. They should, however, be vigilant for any signs of disorderly global rebalancing. Looking ahead, entrenching financial stability into the future would depend upon bolstering market confidence.  In the overall assessment, the adverse consequences of the US sub prime turmoil could weigh heavily on the future stability of financial markets and have the potential to have a wider impact on global growth with particular concerns centred on the prospects for EMEs. If credit conditions tighten, EMEs could become particularly vulnerable to reversals of capital flows with serious implications for their future prospects. A slowing down of the US economy, in combination with capital reversals, could also have adverse consequences for growth on a prolonged basis by affecting exports of manufactures and services, depending on the extent of linkage with the US economy. On the other hand, the flight of capital to safety through diversification could even enhance capital flows to these countries. This could further complicate the conduct of monetary policy. We will have to wait and watch. In general, recent financial markets developments are indicative of evolving uncertainties for EMEs with significant challenges for the conduct of monetary policy and for ensuring financial stability in their economies. As central bankers, we will have to enhance our vigilance. IV.  Challenges for monetary policy Recent financial developments have drawn attention to the trying challenges facing central banks in the conduct of monetary policy, in particular, the limitations imposed by financial markets. These developments highlight the dynamic and complex links between central banks and financial markets. While the dynamics of financial markets are being driven by a combination of a global search for yields, complacency about risks, financial innovations and unprecedented liquidity, the spread of more independent, rule-based central banks has facilitated risk taking through perception of a low probability of short term management or “intervention risk”. This is set against the background of a shift in the balance of economic power within the global system, in particular, in favour of emerging Asia.  While taking a view on the debate, it is important to recognise the changes in the landscape of financial markets – transformation in structure, process and products of financial markets, consolidation in banking, increased electronic data flow and dramatic rise in volumes and volatility. The key issue for central banks is to differentiate between providing short term BIS Review 104/2007 7 
liquidity and operating medium term monetary policy and communicate the difference credibly.  The conduct of monetary policy is also complicated by a host of factors which seem to be simultaneously at work: risk of sustained contagion; global capacity constraints; rising food prices; record high international crude oil prices; tensions in inflation expectations; evolution of sovereign pools of foreign exchange reserves; extent of effectiveness of monetary policy; surveillance and risk monitoring systems; and downgrade risks. In this evolving scenario, central banks may find it necessary to blend the traditional setting of monetary policy with some rethinking and non-traditional policy options which could include coordinated interventions, assurances of liquidity, backed by timely and credible action; emergency liquidity plans, business continuity plans and disaster management strategies. Admittedly, heightened uncertainties continue, even after taking into account the recent central bank activities in key jurisdictions. It is not even clear whether all the related issues have come to the surface for us to make meaningful assessment.  I expect that I can't conclude this address without saying a few words on the domestic situation in India. The best way of doing this is to quote the Governor from his recent speech in Mexico city.  "Available information indicates continuation of the growth momentum during 2007-08 so far at a strong pace with the impulses of growth getting more broad-based. Steady increases in the rate of gross domestic saving and investment, consumption demand, addition of new capacity as well as more intensive and efficient utilisation/capitalisation of existing capacity are expected to provide support to growth during 2007-08. The recent gains in bringing down inflation and in stabilizing inflation expectations should support the current expansionary phase of growth cycle. It is, however, necessary to continuously assess the risks to the inflation outlook emanating from high and volatile international crude prices, the continuing firmness in key food prices and uncertainties surrounding the evolution of demand-supply gaps globally, as well as in India. Risks from global developments continue to persist, especially in the form of inflationary pressures, re-pricing of risks by financial markets and danger of downturn in some asset classes. Excessive leveraging has enhanced the vulnerability of the global financial system. Large changes in liquidity conditions are obscuring assessment of risks, with attendant uncertainty. Given the flux associated with both financial markets and monetary policy settings globally, India cannot be immune to these developments. The policy challenge for Reserve Bank, now, is to manage the current transition to a higher growth path while containing inflationary pressures and focusing on financial stability. Contextually, we in the Reserve Bank are, therefore, maintaining enhanced vigilance to be able to respond appropriately to the prevailing heightened uncertainties in global financial, as well as, monetary conditions". 8 BIS Review 104/2007 
Jean-Pierre Roth: The euro – a stabilising factor in the international currency system Summary of a speech by Mr Jean-Pierre Roth, Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank for International Settlements, at the Fondation Jean Monnet pour l'Europe, Lausanne, 21 September 2007. The complete speech can be found in French on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). *      *      * The euro is undoubtedly a success story. It has contributed to stabilising the international currency system. In Europe, the former monetary disorder has been replaced by a new monetary order. The European payment system has become more transparent and price stability is guaranteed. Switzerland, too, is benefiting from European currency stability. The Swiss franc is taking advantage of a monetary environment that is considerably calmer than previously. The euro and the franc are coexisting very successfully. Nevertheless, it would be wrong to claim that all the effects of European currency integration have already worked their way through to the real economy. In spurring on competition and promoting transparency, the euro is having an integrating effect. However, there are still considerable obstacles standing in the way of this integration process.

T T Mboweni: Overview of the South African economy Address by Mr T T Mboweni, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, at the 87th ordinary general meeting of shareholders, Pretoria, 20 September 2007. *      *      * Introduction The primary goal of the South African Reserve Bank (the Bank) is the achievement and maintenance of price stability. However, the role of the Bank in the economy goes beyond a narrow monetary policy focus. Low and stable inflation provides an important framework for economic growth, but regulation and supervision of parts of the financial sector, as well as the oversight of the payment system ensure that the wheels of the economy continue to turn efficiently. In the past year we have had to execute our mandate in an increasingly difficult and uncertain environment. The South African financial markets have not been spared the effects of the recent volatility in the financial markets and we have to be increasingly vigilant of the risks posed to the domestic economic landscape. At the same time we have to ensure good governance with respect to the internal workings of the Bank. It is against the backdrop of this volatile economic environment that I report to you today. Today we also release our Annual Economic Report which covers developments in the domestic and international economy over the past year. In particular, we highlight the main economic developments which have affected our operations and policy implementation. The focus of this address is on the main operational areas of the Bank including monetary policy and its implementation, gold and foreign-exchange reserves management, financial stability issues, the national payment system, banking regulation and supervision, international co-operation and internal administration. Monetary policy This past year has been a challenging one for monetary policy. As I reported in August last year, from the middle of 2006 pressures on inflation emerged, and have since intensified. By December 2006, year-on-year CPIX inflation measured 5,0 per cent compared to 3,7 per cent in April of that year. Inflation remained within the target range until April 2007 when it increased to 6,3 per cent from 5,5 per cent in the previous month. Since then it has remained outside the target range. Initially the main drivers of this adverse trend were food and petrol, but more recently there has been evidence of a more generalised upward trend in inflation, including that of services prices. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) responded to these developments by raising the repurchase rate by 50 basis points in June 2006, the first increase since 2002. This was followed by successive increases of 50 basis points at each of the subsequent three meetings of the MPC in 2006. By December the repurchase rate had increased to 9,0 per cent per annum. The pressures on inflation emanated from both international and domestic sources. At the global level, the world economy continued its strong performance which contributed to sustained upward pressure on oil and food prices which, in turn, had a direct impact on domestic food and petrol prices. These items were the major contributors to the upward inflation trends during 2006. In August last year international oil prices peaked at levels just below US$80 per barrel. Prices were influenced by strong global demand, supply disruptions in a number of countries and geopolitical uncertainties. Food price pressures have also had a global dimension. Drought conditions in a number of countries as well as the increased diversion of agricultural products, particularly wheat, maize and sugar, to bio-fuels production have contributed to this BIS Review 103/2007 1 
trend. South Africa was not immune to these developments which, in conjunction with the impact of drought conditions in a number of regions, resulted in an acceleration of food price inflation, in particular meat prices and to a lesser extent maize prices. In October and November 2006 meat prices increased at year-on-year rates of almost 20 per cent, while grain product prices increased by around 6 per cent. Although world inflation remained under control, the pressures emanating from these developments have dictated that monetary policy remains restrictive in many countries. Domestically, the MPC had to contend with the combined threats of high rates of growth of consumption expenditure and credit extension. In the second half of 2006, domestic household consumption demand growth also continued at a robust pace of around 7 per cent per annum, while the various consumer confidence indices indicated sustained optimism on the part of consumers despite the tightening stance of monetary policy. Towards the end of the year, motor vehicle sales, particularly passenger vehicles, showed some signs of moderation. Underpinning this consumer exuberance were strong rates of growth of credit extension, despite an increase in securitisation transactions. Following the 15-per-cent depreciation of the effective exchange rate from May to July 2006, the exchange rate of the rand had an impact on the inflation outlook. However, it then remained in a fairly tight trading range, despite the continued widening of the deficit on the current account of the balance of payments, which continued to be adequately financed by capital inflows. Not all the determinants of the inflation rate posed a threat to the outlook. Nominal unit labour costs were well contained, fiscal policy continued to be supportive of monetary policy and although the economy was growing at a robust pace, it was not deemed to be growing at a rate significantly above potential. Inflation expectations were also anchored within the inflation target range. In the first two months of 2007 international oil prices declined significantly, with the price of North Sea Brent crude oil reaching a low of US$51 per barrel in January. These developments contributed to a general downward revision of oil price and inflation forecasts. At the same time, there were tentative signs of some moderation in household consumption expenditure, particularly with respect to passenger vehicle sales. The MPC was also mindful of the fact that interest rate adjustments take time to impact fully on demand. Although the inflation risks were still perceived to be on the upside, the continued stability of the exchange rate, sustained fiscal restraint and the improved inflation expectations resulted in the committee keeping interest rates on hold at the February and April meetings of the MPC. By the June 2007 meeting of the MPC, the outlook had deteriorated further. Despite the previous adjustments to the monetary policy stance, available data at the time suggested that real household consumption expenditure and credit extension remained strong, growing at year-on-year rates of around 7 per cent and 26 per cent, respectively. International oil prices resumed their upward trend, eventually peaking at around US$78 per barrel in July. The overall impact of the adverse oil-price trend on domestic inflation was moderated somewhat by the relative stability of the rand exchange rate. However, following the breach of the upper end of the inflation target, there were some worrying signs of a deterioration in inflation expectations. Furthermore, partly in response to the higher inflation outcomes, nominal wage settlements began to trend higher, posing a further risk to the inflation outlook. In response to these pressures and the less favourable outlook, the repurchase rate was increased at both the June and August 2007 meetings of the MPC. At the time of the August meeting, the turmoil in the world financial markets had begun. At that stage it was unclear to the MPC whether these developments would be confined to the financial markets, or if they would impact significantly on the growth prospects domestically and abroad. The committee decided that it was appropriate to remain focused on the inflation target, and react to financial market developments insofar as they affected the inflation outlook. 2 BIS Review 103/2007 
The breach of the target can be seen as a setback for monetary policy. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the main cause of inflation exceeding the upper end of the inflation target range was factors beyond the direct influence of monetary policy. We are mindful, however, of the impact of these developments on inflation expectations and the need to act against the emerging broader inflation pressures. The most recent inflation forecasts of the Bank suggest that inflation may return to within the inflation target range during the second half of next year, and the MPC will continue to act accordingly to ensure that this outcome is achieved. Money-market operations To ensure that the implementation of monetary policy was in line with the stance determined by the MPC, the Bank managed the daily liquidity requirement in the money market in a range roughly between R10 billion and R15 billion. The Bank also broadened the list of securities that qualify as eligible collateral in its refinancing operations. With effect from 23 May 2007, two categories of collateral are now accepted. Category 1 securities comprise Government bonds, Land Bank bills, STRIPS, SARB debentures and Treasury bills. The new Category 2 securities comprise all non-bank, non-government securities that are included in the All Bond Index of the Bond Exchange of South Africa. Borrowers using this category have to provide more collateral. In co-operation with various market participants the Bank addressed shortcomings that had been identified in the South African Overnight Interbank Average (Saonia) rate. The Saonia rate was replaced by the South African Benchmark Overnight Rate on deposits (Sabor), which is a more representative and reliable pricing benchmark than its predecessor. Reserves accumulation and management The Bank has continued to increase its level of official reserves. Gross gold and foreign exchange reserves increased from US$23 billion at the end of March 2006 to US$29,8 billion at the end of August 2007. The international liquidity position, which was positively affected by the prepayment by the Bank of the US$1 billion syndicated loan that was raised in 2004, increased from US$19,5 billion to US$27,4 billion over the same period. The prepayment resulted in some cost savings for the Bank, and conveyed a positive signal to counterparties of the Bank and the market. With the recent buy-back of foreign currency-denominated debt by the National Treasury, the prepayment also contributed to the effort to reduce the external vulnerability of the country. A key focus area remained the refinement of the reserves management capabilities of the Bank. In this regard, the Bank worked closely with the World Bank under the auspices of the latter’s Reserves Asset Management Programme for central banks. Capacity building is central to these efforts, and the Bank continued to invest in training and systems for staff involved in the areas of reserves and risk management. In addition, the investment policy of the Bank was reviewed and the governance structure was enhanced by the establishment of a Reserves Management Committee. The Bank and the National Treasury further strengthened their co-operation in the areas of reserves accumulation and liquidity management. The National Treasury assisted in draining a large portion of the liquidity created by the foreign-exchange purchases of the Bank. At the end of July 2007, the special deposit account of the National Treasury with the Bank, which was created for this purpose, totalled R54,5 billion including accrued interest. Agreement has been reached on the settlement of outstanding balances on the Gold and Foreign Exchange Contingency Reserve Account (GFECRA). The Bank and the National Treasury have agreed that, in future, only realised profit or loss positions that have an influence on money-market liquidity would be settled on a regular basis. This arrangement should reduce the amount of funds flowing between the Bank and the National Treasury and moderate the impact on BIS Review 103/2007 3 
money-market liquidity. Under this new arrangement, the Bank transferred an amount of R319,3 million (including interest) to the National Treasury for settling the outstanding GFECRA balance as at 31 March 2006. Currency distribution Efforts are continuing to combat the counterfeiting of banknotes and to ensure that only banknotes and coin of acceptable quality are in circulation. Minimum standards for the reissue of banknotes have been prescribed. In collaboration with the commercial banks the primary phase of the implementation of the Integrated Cash Management System has been completed. This system has the potential to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the National Cash Management System in the cash value chain, thereby reducing the cost of cash to the public. The developmental phase of the interactive Cash Risk Identification and Mitigation programme developed by the Bank and the South African Banking Risk Information Centre with the participation of the commercial banks, the cash-in-transit industry and the South African Police Service has been completed. This programme defines the minimum security standards for the cash management industry to reduce incidents of cash-in-transit heists and banking crimes, and is now being consulted on with unions and employee representatives. The minimum standards will also be promulgated into regulations by the Minister of Safety and Security. The national payment system The value of total settlement in the South African Multiple Option Settlement (SAMOS) system amounted to an all-time high of R5,6 trillion in July 2007, which is approximately R280 billion per day. This settlement figure also includes transactions stemming from the equity and bond markets. In 2006 and 2007, approximately 90 per cent of settlement through the SAMOS system was effected on a real-time basis during the day. The remainder, which emanated from the retail environment, was settled in the evening. Directives for conduct in the payment system for system operators and third-party service providers will become effective during 2007. In May 2007 the Bank also commenced with the detailed oversight of non-bank participants in the national payment system. Specific focus is being placed on the operational soundness of payment clearing house operators. Following the promulgation of the National Credit Act, 2007, amendments were made to the National Payment System Act, 1998. These amendments outlawed any non-statutory preferential treatment of a payment instruction in any given payment system and paved the way for the implementation of a specific payment stream to process payment instructions randomly. Financial stability In support of its objective to achieve and maintain price stability, the Bank also seeks to identify inherent weaknesses in the financial system and monitor risks that may result in financial system disturbances. On the basis of an analysis of various financial soundness indicators the financial system was appraised as sound. The Bank also assessed the financial regulatory system in South Africa to be inherently robust in terms of the twelve key financial soundness standards identified by the Financial Stability Forum of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). Some financial regulatory challenges remain. These include the implications of the recently introduced National Credit Act, the possible introduction of an explicit deposit insurance scheme, the review of South 4 BIS Review 103/2007 
Africa’s membership of the Financial Action Task Force, initiatives to bring the hedge fund industry within the scope of current regulation, and the implementation of a new capital framework (Basel II) for banks on 1 January 2008. In co-operation with other stakeholders in financial stability, the Bank furthered its efforts to prepare and maintain suitable contingency plans and crisis management strategies to respond to systemic distress. In the year under review, a programme of financial sector continuity testing was initiated to help hone the responses of financial sector authorities to systemic threats. The Bank also participated in the Coordinated Compilation Exercise of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), aimed at developing capacities of countries to compile financial soundness indicators for the surveillance of financial systems. Banking regulation and supervision The Bank has the responsibility to ensure that the domestic banking regulatory environment stays abreast of international best practice. A key focus area remains the preparation for the implementation of Basel II. The implementation programme aims to effect the requisite amendments to the legal framework and ensures the successful implementation of Basel II on 1 January 2008. The migration to Basel II has necessitated intensified interaction with the banks. Interaction has included on-site visits by staff of the Bank, requests for and the processing of specific information to assess the impact of Basel II on the capital adequacy of banks, as well as readiness assessment meetings with banks. In accordance with the latest industry requirements and market developments, and with the prescriptions of Basel II in mind, a finalised draft Banks Amendment Bill was approved by the Standing Committee for the Revision of the Banks Act in November 2006. Parliamentary hearings on the draft Bill were held in mid-June 2007. The Bill is expected to be promulgated later this year, with implementation effective from 1 January 2008. The Regulations relating to banks (the Regulations) have been reviewed in totality to comply with the prescriptions of Basel II and to provide banks in South Africa with all the options and approaches offered under Basel II. A compliance assessment with the revised 25 Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision was completed in October 2006. Based on this assessment, a gap analysis was completed and supervisors are implementing plans to improve the supervisory process with immediate effect where possible. Where necessary, amendments will be made to the Banks Act, 1990, and Regulations to ensure effective supervision. During the review period the level of compliance of the banking industry with the application of anti-money laundering and the combating of terrorist-financing legislation remained a focus area. About 40 suspect business or investment schemes, which gave the impression of being engaged in banking activity, are under investigation. International co-operation South Africa assumed the chair of the G-20 for 2007 and the Bank and the National Treasury have been jointly co-ordinating activities. The G-20 comprises systemically important developed and emerging-market economies. Two G-20 Deputies meetings, one in Pretoria and the other in Durban, and two African Policy Seminars, which were held on the fringes of the G-20 Deputies meetings, were hosted. Our term as host will culminate in the G-20 Summit of Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors, which will be held in the Western Cape on 17 and 18 November 2007. Policy topics that will be considered include the reform of the Bretton Woods Institutions, commodity BIS Review 103/2007 5 
cycles and financial stability, and fiscal elements of growth and development. These topics were also the focus of G-20 seminars hosted in Brazil, the United States and Turkey earlier this year. The international relations of the Bank remain focused on strengthening co-operation with central banks and multilateral organisations. Special attention has been given to the African continent and the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region in particular, where efforts are geared towards the achievement of regional integration. The Bank continues to take a strong leadership role in the Committee of Central Bank Governors (CCBG) in SADC. In its role as leader of the SADC Payment System Project and under the auspices of the CCBG, the Bank has continued to facilitate the modernisation and harmonisation of the SADC regional payment, clearing and settlement systems. To date, the project has focused on the implementation of Real Time Gross Settlement systems, automated clearing and payment system oversight. Significant progress has been achieved in this regard and the current focus of the project is on areas such as remittances, retail payment system risk reduction, the securities settlement project and capacity building for payment system oversight. Further assistance will be provided to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Madagascar in terms of the planning of their payment system development. The Bank continues to be an active participant in the activities of the BIS. The participation of the Bank in and its contribution to the Foreign Exchange Settlement Risk Subgroup of the BIS Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems ensured that the Bank keeps abreast of international developments in this area and promotes best practice. Closer bilateral relations with other central banks have resulted in the signing of Memoranda of Understanding with the central banks of China and Peru in the past year. In addition, the Bank has received numerous visits from other central banks which have allowed for more exchange of information. The Bank has maintained close relations with multilateral organisations. Our collaboration with the IMF and the World Bank has resulted in a number of joint seminars and courses being presented by the South African Reserve Bank College (College) in 2007. These are open to participants from central banks and finance ministries from the African continent. Internal administration The Annual Report of the Bank was distributed to shareholders before this meeting. The total balance sheet of the Bank shows an increase from R168 billion at the end of March 2006 to R220 billion at the end of March 2007. The increase was mainly the result of the accumulation of official gold and foreign-exchange reserves and was financed in the main by an increase in government deposits, an increase in currency in circulation and the effect of valuation adjustments to the net reserves as a result of exchange rate movements. These adjustments are reflected in the increase in the GFECRA. The profit before taxation of the Bank increased from R1 038 million for the previous financial year to R2 907 million for the financial year ending 31 March 2007. Budgeted expenditure of the Bank for the current financial year amounts to R1 879 million, compared to actual expenditure of R1 658 million in the financial year to 31 March 2007. This represents an increase of 13,3 per cent in budgeted expenditure compared to actual expenditure for the previous financial year. This increase is largely a result of the increased volume and cost of producing new currency. The four subsidiary companies of the Bank achieved their objectives during the financial year. After a review of reports by their Boards of Directors and internal and external auditors, the Bank is satisfied that these companies are managed in accordance with their objectives and best corporate governance practice. The results of the subsidiaries are reported on a 6 BIS Review 103/2007 
consolidated basis with those of the Bank in the financial statements. The Bank continued to operate an over-the-counter market for the trading of its shares. During the financial year ending 31 March 2007, 24 transactions in respect of 94 700 shares of the Bank were concluded at an average price of R1,60 per share. On 31 March 2007, the Bank had 612 registered shareholders and by 31 August this number had increased to 630. The Bank views risk management as an essential element of good corporate governance and has therefore established a Risk Management Committee (RMC) to oversee the risk management process in the Bank. The RMC is chaired by a Deputy Governor and the four executive general managers of the Bank also serve as members. Business continuity planning for the Bank has been completed and extensive adequacy testing is currently being conducted. A consolidated information and communication technology disaster recovery facility was established to enable the successful recovery and continuation of critical business processes in the event of a disaster or serious disruption at the Head Office building. The sourcing of an enterprise resource planning solution for the Bank was approved and a suitable solution selected. This system will replace many of the old and ageing central services software systems in the Bank and also integrate data from disparate information systems into one unified system. The Bank continues to maintain and improve existing buildings and additions not only to enhance the value of its properties, but also to preserve the cultural heritage of the country and support country-wide inner-city development initiatives where possible. Major renovations and refurbishment are being undertaken at Head Office and the branches in Pretoria North, Johannesburg and Cape Town. A new branch is being planned for Bloemfontein and plans are under way to renovate the branches in East London and Port Elizabeth, while preserving the historical character of these buildings. Corporate art collections play a critical role in nurturing artistic talent. In the more than 53 years that the Bank’s art collection has existed, it has supported a wide range of emerging and established artists. A book depicting a selection of the more than 600 works of art, dispersed throughout Head Office, the seven branches and the College was published earlier this month and it is believed that this book will make a valuable contribution to the appreciation of art. The Bank continues to pay close attention to its human resources. The staff complement decreased to 1 934 at the end of March 2007, compared to 1 956 a year earlier. The overall staff turnover for the period was 6,8 per cent. The profile of new appointees was 84 per cent black, with 77 per cent of the management appointees black, and 45 per cent female. The profile of new appointees since 1 April 2007 until the end of July 2007 is 88 per cent black and 40 per cent female, with 80 per cent of the management appointees black, and 60 per cent female. The modernisation process pertaining to the revised Staff Policies was concluded and the policies implemented. The outstanding policies pertaining to outside occupations and directorships, as well as to ethics are being consulted with staff. An emphasis on wellness management continues, with the focus on physical and mental health. Disability management and HIV and Aids prevention continue to receive attention. Other measures taken include the provision of medical and psychological wellness services. The Bank continues to place an emphasis on developing its staff. In addition to students who have recently completed their degrees, the Cadet Graduate Programme will be expanded to also cater for staff members of the Bank. This will double the number of cadets to twenty in 2008. In an effort to guarantee future accreditation for its learnerships, the College has completed a process to ensure that all its learning programmes adhere to the principles of outcomes-based education. BIS Review 103/2007 7 
To stimulate research in the Bank, a research fellows programme has been introduced in terms of which senior researchers from other central banks and academia are invited to spend time at the Bank and engage in collaborative research. Three research fellows, two of whom are from abroad, have already spent time at the Bank in 2007, and a fourth is expected later in the year. Applications have been invited for the 2008 programme. To contribute further to the economic research effort in the country, a conference on macroeconomic policy challenges for South Africa was organised by the College in 2006. It included papers presented by leading academics from local and international universities, as well as other local economists. Conclusion From a monetary policy perspective this past year has been particularly challenging for the Bank. The international environment has been uncertain, and the recent turmoil in international markets means that further challenges and uncertainties lie ahead. Nevertheless, the Bank will continue to focus on achieving its mandate and will strive to bring inflation to within the target range. Low and stable inflation remains the best contribution the Bank can make to economic growth and development in South Africa. The Bank will continue to make a contribution to financial stability in the country. Apart from oversight and regulation of the national payment system, future challenges are likely to come from the introduction of Basel II at the beginning of next year, the possible implications of the National Credit Act, and the impact of higher interest rates on a highly indebted population. We will not lose sight of the need to give attention to the internal management of the Bank. The Bank remains committed to the training and development of staff in the broader context of its Employment Equity Plan. Acknowledgements I want to thank the Presidency, the Government and Parliament for their continued support. Through the system of bilateral committees, the Bank has maintained a good working relationship with the National Treasury. I wish to thank the Minister and Deputy Minister of Finance, and the Director-General of the National Treasury and his staff for their ongoing support and co-operation. I also wish to express my thanks to the members of the Board for their commitment to the Bank. Their efforts are important in ensuring effective corporate governance and strategic direction for the Bank. Last but by no means least, I wish to thank the deputy governors, management and staff of the Bank for their support and contributions to the successful running of the Bank. An organisation such as ours is only as good as the quality and commitment of its personnel. We are indeed fortunate to be able to attract an excellent group of employees. 8 BIS Review 103/2007 
Ric Battellino: The strength of the Australian economy and financial markets Remarks by Mr Ric Battellino, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, at the Launch of the 2007 Australian Financial Markets Report and the Invest Australia Gold Book, Sydney, 19 September 2007. *      *      * It’s a pleasure to take part in the launch of these two reports that highlight the strength of the Australian economy and financial markets.  I would like to congratulate Invest Australia, the ASX and AFMA for putting together such comprehensive and informative documents. They are of immense benefit not only to market participants and foreign firms looking to enter the Australian market, but also to regulators, academics and students.  I would also like to congratulate the three organisations more generally for the excellent job they do in supporting, promoting and helping to regulate Australian financial markets. This is important work because finance makes such a vital contribution to the Australian economy, not only directly, but also through its role in supporting other sectors of the economy.  As noted in the Invest Australia report, Australia has had an extended period of strong economic growth, which is about to head into its seventeenth year. Even if we take just the past decade, real GDP has grown by a cumulative 40 per cent and nominal GDP has grown by 90 per cent.  Financial markets have exhibited even faster growth over this period. The value of companies listed on the ASX has grown by 275 per cent, and the value of debt securities on issue in Australia has increased by 170 per cent.  The growth of turnover in financial markets has been even more dramatic, increasing by 290 per cent over the decade. So while the nominal economy has almost doubled in size over the past ten years, turnover in financial markets has almost quadrupled.  The remarkable thing is that the pace of growth shows no sign of slowing.  The members of the Campbell Inquiry, who helped set Australia on the path of financial deregulation and market development, would I think be very pleased at the way the financial system has evolved over the ensuing 25 years or so.  The previous speakers have outlined the highlights of the reports being launched today, so I won’t repeat them. Rather, what I would like to do is take a step back from the impressive figures contained in those reports, and consider two questions:  • why do financial markets and market turnover consistently grow faster than the economy as whole? and  • what does all this increase in financial activity mean for the real economy?  Turnover and GDP  Let me start with the first question.  Financial markets play an important role in mobilising savings and allocating them to the most productive investment opportunities. There are therefore strong links from financial markets to the economy. The Australian economy would not have been able to record the strong growth that it has if there had not been such a strong expansion in financial markets. Of course, the links between markets and the economy also run strongly in the other BIS Review 103/2007 1 
direction: without strong economic growth, we would not have seen financial markets develop as they have.  Even acknowledging these strong two-way links, however, we are still left with the question of why financial activity consistently rises faster than economic activity.  Part of the answer is that the rapid growth in financial activity is due to rising private sector wealth, as this also has been rising faster than GDP. Over the past decade, for example, household financial wealth has risen by about 170 per cent, compared with the 90 per cent increase in nominal GDP noted earlier. A lot of this increase in wealth has found its way into the superannuation industry, where it is professionally managed across a wide range of markets, and this no doubt has contributed to financial market activity.  But even this rapid growth in wealth still falls short of growth in financial activity. So I don’t think this is the complete answer.  The other part of the answer, I think, is innovation.  Innovation has been a key feature of financial markets throughout the past 25 years. This has increased the range of financial products available to savers and investors, providing them with more opportunities to adjust their assets and liabilities to fit in with their risk/return preferences. Often this has been done by breaking down financial products into their component parts. A good example is the way in which derivative products have allowed the various risks that are inherent in financial products to be separated, so that investors need only take on those risks with which they are comfortable.  One only has to look at how the variety of financial products has expanded over the years, and the broad range of markets that are now listed in the AFMA report, to get a feel for how innovative and dynamic the finance industry has been.  This innovation has encouraged market turnover in several ways:  • First, there is the new product effect. Like all new products, new financial products typically experience very rapid growth in their early years, as users discover their advantages.  • Second, innovation has provided savers and investors with more variety, giving them greater scope to adjust their portfolios.  • And lastly, and perhaps more importantly, innovation has reduced costs, so the barriers to saving and investment, and to changing portfolio structures, have diminished.  What does the increase in financial activity mean?  Let me now move to the second question.  Financial market activity is, of course, not an end in itself – at least for those people not employed in the finance sector – so the important question most people want to know is what this increase in financial activity means for the real economy.  Here, I think, the answer is a very positive one.  Vibrant, competitive and innovative financial markets work to increase the availability, and reduce the cost, of finance.  There are some obvious examples of how this affects our day-to-day lives.  Take the housing market. The development of wholesale capital markets provided funding for non-bank lenders and allowed them to compete with deposit-taking institutions in housing lending. This led to a substantial reduction in interest margins on housing lending, from about 2 BIS Review 103/2007 
400 basis points 15 years ago to a little over 100 basis points today. This has been a very material benefit to Australian households.  The benefits of financial market development have not been restricted to households. Interest margins and the cost of borrowing have also come down for businesses, as financial intermediaries have competed with capital markets in meeting businesses’ funding needs. Fifteen years ago, the average interest margin on business loans was 570 basis points; today it is only 135 points.  In short, the trading and innovation that we see in financial markets eventually flows through to reduced costs for the users of financial services. This has meant that the amount spent by households and businesses on financial services has grown much less than financial activity. For example, even though financial activity has risen by a factor of several times GDP over the past decade, the finance and insurance sector’s share of national income has risen only slightly, from around 5½ per cent to around 7 per cent.  Financial innovation has also allowed households and businesses to reduce risks. Firms have been better able to structure their financing to suit the characteristics of their businesses and to manage the risks associated with their revenue flows. Foreign exchange and commodity derivatives are good examples of innovations that have helped many Australian companies in this regard.  The overall effect of all this has been to make the economy more resilient and stable. The ability of the Australian economy to come through the Asian financial crisis largely unscathed owed importantly to the fact that Australian firms and financial institutions had been able to hedge a lot of the risks that caused so much damage elsewhere in Asia.  The diversity and depth of Australian markets, by ensuring that avenues of financing are always available, also add to the resilience of the economy.  I would also give some credit to the financial sector for contributing to the reduction in inflation volatility we have seen over the past 15 years. Part of this can be traced to the reduced pass-through to inflation of changes in the exchange rate, which, in turn, has been partly attributable to the increased use of exchange rate hedging by firms.  Conclusion  So let me end by saying that it is clear that the growth of financial markets and the growth of the economy are closely intertwined. Financial markets need a strong economy to thrive, and the economy needs strong, vibrant and well-regulated markets if it is to continue to expand.  I think that it is fair to conclude that Australia to date has been well served by its financial markets, and I would encourage you to continue to work to maintain these high standards.

BIS Review 102/2007 1 Svein Gjedrem: Uncertainty, economic models and monetary policy  Address by Mr Svein Gjedrem, Governor of Norges Bank (Central Bank of Norway), at the Centre for Monetary Economics/Norwegian School of Management, Oslo, 17 September 2007. Please note that the text below may differ slightly from the actual presentation. The address is based on the assessments presented at Norges Bank’s press conference following the Executive Board’s monetary policy meeting on 15 August, Monetary Policy Report 2/07 and on previous speeches. *      *      * I welcome the opportunity this time to discuss with you at the Centre for Monetary Economics certain themes that are not related to the most newsworthy economic policy issues. I will discuss the following three themes:  • the role of monetary policy  • our view of economic models as a basis for interest rate setting  • and finally, measuring inflation and uncertainty linked to the rate of inflation at a given point in time  Let me start by discussing the role of monetary policy. The primary objective of monetary policy is to ensure that inflation expectations are low and stable. Expectations of low and stable inflation provide a nominal anchor. Economic agents’ inflation expectations influence the decisions they make today. Our experience – and the experience of other countries – shows that without a nominal anchor we cannot achieve stability in employment and output.  The aim of preventing inflation expectations from becoming entrenched below the operational target of 2.5 per cent was one of the main reasons that the interest rate was lowered to a very low level in 2003 and 2004, when inflation receded and approached zero. Low interest rates stimulated demand and output and have gradually led to prospects for higher inflation, to which we have responded by increasing the interest rate. Consumer price inflation is still fairly low, but capacity utilisation is now at such a high level that inflation is projected to move up gradually to 2.5 per cent. Higher interest rates will contribute to a gradual decline in capacity utilisation so that inflation will not become too high.  In spite of several years of fairly low inflation, inflation expectations, as for example these – and not necessarily precisely – are measured by TNS Gallup’s expectations survey, have held up around the inflation target. Even if there has been a longer period of low and relatively stable inflation expectations, we must be alert to developments that may change this.  Norway’s and other countries’ economic history show that inflation and inflation expectations can become unhinged. There are many self-regulating mechanisms in the economy, but inflation does not regulate itself.  Through history, monetary policy has in various ways been geared towards providing the economy with a nominal anchor. From the mid-1800s, many countries decided to peg the value of money to gold. Norway switched from the silver standard to the gold standard in 1874. The latter system provided the economy and prices with a fixed nominal anchor. Inflation was determined by growth in output on the one hand the supply of gold on the other. This was a system we had in common with our trading partners. Furthermore, we participated in the Scandinavian currency union as from 1875.  The gold standard was suspended during World War I when the British government largely financed the war by printing money. Parity policy in the interwar years was unsuccessful in many countries. After World War II, countries made a joint effort to stabilise price 
2 BIS Review 102/2007 developments by establishing the Bretton Woods system. The US dollar was pegged to gold and the other currencies to the dollar. In this way, we chose – with the value of gold as the basis – a fixed exchange rate and indirect inflation in other countries as our nominal anchor. The Bretton Woods system collapsed in 1971. In the absence of gold as an anchor, the real value of banknotes and coins and bank deposits was now dependent on confidence that the central banks would not inject so much cash into the economic system that the value of money declined. The various countries chose different solutions. In Norway, we looked to other countries for both confidence and our inflation level, by tying our exchange rate in various ways to other countries’ currencies. In the ten years from 1976 to 1986, confidence in this policy was severely eroded. In this period, there were a total of ten devaluations or "technical adjustments" that entailed devaluation, often with the aim of bringing costs back under control. The objective of keeping inflation stable was set aside. Repeated devaluations eventually led to expectations that the authorities would not in the future stand by their promise of a fixed exchange rate, and that if price and cost inflation became too high, it was expected that the krone would be devalued again. The social partners began to take higher inflation into account in wage demands and price setting.  The last devaluation came in 1986. Subsequently, the interest rate was used to maintain a fixed krone exchange rate in order to bring price and cost inflation under control. We again chose a fixed exchange rate and other countries' inflation as a nominal anchor. Economic policy was influenced by the experiences of other countries that had dealt with the problem of inflation earlier, such as the US and Germany. The decline in inflation in Norway thus came in the wake of the fall in inflation abroad. Historical data seem to suggest that after turbulent periods, inflation gradually reverts to a low and stable level and that over time domestic inflation is determined by external inflation. However, inflation in a country with its own national currency is not something that just drifts in with the wind from abroad. It is the monetary policy choices we make in Norway that determine price developments here.  We had to abandon our fixed exchange rate policy in December 1992. One important reason for this was the inherent weaknesses in the fixed exchange rate system in an environment of free capital flows and deep financial markets. When the fixed exchange rate policy was formally abandoned, there was a risk that the Norwegian economy could again lose its nominal anchor. However, the krone exchange rate showed little movement and soon found a new range. Fiscal policy had a stabilising effect. The exchange rate remained stable until autumn 1996. This was partly due to low wage growth and a level of total demand that did not generate pressures in the economy. After a period, the krone began to show wider fluctuations. The experience of the latter half of the 1990s demonstrated that monetary policy cannot fine-tune the exchange rate. Developments in the international financial markets led to greater fluctuations. And more fundamentally – exchange rate developments no longer sent signals back to wage formation and fiscal policy when labour market pressures mounted and incomes policy failed. High petroleum revenues, fiscal slippage and expectations of increased use of petroleum revenues contributed to this. The exchange rate was therefore no longer suitable as a nominal anchor. As a result, Norges Bank gradually placed increasing emphasis on low and stable inflation. In 2001, the Norwegian authorities decided that monetary policy in Norway was to be oriented towards low and stable inflation through a numerical target for inflation, as was the case in many other countries later in the 1990s. As under the gold standard or the fixed exchange rate regimes, it is again our own choice of nominal anchor that determines the rate of inflation in Norway over time.  
BIS Review 102/2007 3 Future studies will probably find that inflation reverts to the inflation target over time. This is an indication that monetary policy is working and not that there is a natural inflation rate or a natural, self-regulating mechanism.  Inflation is still influenced by exogenous conditions. Increased globalisation, particularly China’s growing importance in world trade, has in the past ten years for example resulted in low imported inflation measured in a foreign currency. At the same time, productivity growth has been high in many countries. These positive supply-side features have for a period contributed to a favourable development in the short-term trade-off between economic growth and inflation. As a result, many countries where inflation was a little too high at the outset have been able to bring down inflation at virtually no cost. In this respect, we can probably talk about some degree of endogeneity in inflation.1 However, it is still up to the authorities through the orientation of monetary policy to choose whether inflation is to remain low and stable on a more permanent basis.  Over time, interest rate setting is aimed at keeping inflation close to target. In the process, interest rates will have short-term direct or indirect effects on a number of other economic variables. In the short to medium term, we weigh the aim of stability in output and employment on the one hand against stability in inflation on the other hand. This does not mean that this is one instrument and two separate objectives, but that we weigh the two objectives against each other.  It might be tempting to give weight to other objectives beyond the effects they might have on inflation. This would entail taking risks and making compromises with regard to the inflation target. There are in particular two other such objectives that have been singled out:  • sustaining employment at a high level,  • stabilise property prices and credit. High demand for labour can encourage more people, who would otherwise have remained stuck in the welfare system, to enter the labour market. A period of high demand for labour may thus increase the effective labour force on a more permanent basis. Conversely, a period of low demand for labour can increase flows into benefit schemes and lead to a permanent reduction in the labour force. If the central bank were to attempt to use such labour market mechanisms, it would have contributed to amplifying demand for labour in an upturn through lower interest rates, while countering a fall in demand in a downturn by keeping interest rates low. Such a policy can be reminiscent of the low interest rate policy of the 1970s and the 1980s and will fairly rapidly be factored into economic agents’ inflation expectations. Over time, such a monetary policy will lead to higher inflation, not higher employment.  Unemployment has declined markedly and is now very low. At the same time, wage earners’ share of corporate earnings has declined. Historically, there has been a clearly negative relationship between unemployment and wage shares. Developments in recent years have paved the way for strong growth in employment, also today when the cyclical upturn is in a mature phase.  Developments in the past years must be seen against the background of the effects of a number of positive supply-side conditions on the Norwegian economy. High export prices and low import prices have led to a low rate of increase in consumer prices and an increase in household real wage income, but also to high corporate earnings and solid growth in employment.                                                   1  See, inter alia, Rogoff, K. (2003), “Globalization and Global Disinflation,” Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Economic Review, Fourth Quarter, 45-78. 
4 BIS Review 102/2007 At the same time, productivity growth has been unusually high. The effects of this are more complex. In the early phase of the recovery, this delayed a pick-up in employment growth, but also contributed to low inflation. Increased productivity means that demand can remain high without rising inflation. The interest rate was set at a low level to bring inflation back to target. At the same time, this also enabled enterprises to make use of a higher growth potential. Eventually this also resulted in higher demand for labour.  Improved efficiency is another factor that explains the high level of profitability in the Norwegian business sector. At the same time, there has been an ample supply of foreign labour, which has probably had a dampening impact on wage growth. In addition, increased globalisation in general may have broadened the scope for Norwegian enterprises to relocate production to other countries if labour costs become too high. Such a development probably places some restraint on wage demands among workers in sectors where enterprises have such opportunities.  Is it possible to sustain the combination of low employment and low wage shares? First, it partly depends on whether the positive supply-side conditions are sustained. There is probably symmetry here. Should the terms of trade deteriorate, productivity growth slacken and foreign workers return to their home country, the wage share will increase, profits fall and unemployment increase.  Second, even without a reversal profits may fall and unemployment rise. The implications of this will depend on how far businesses, in their search for qualified labour, will stretch themselves in bidding up wages. This will also depend on how employees react and their adaptability as well as developments in benefit schemes and other social schemes.  Long periods of rapidly rising property prices and debt can be a source of future instability in the real economy. Should monetary policy give weight to developments in property and credit markets beyond their impact on inflation? Low interest rates have fuelled the rise in property prices and debt accumulation. Large volumes of lending are being used to finance consumption and investment, among other things in housing. At the same time, the many positive supply-side conditions – with strong growth in real income in the household sector and in private and public enterprises – have probably made a more direct contribution to the sharp rise in house prices and debt accumulation. When capital – and increasingly labour as well – flows more freely across borders, prices for these factors of production will to a greater extent reflect global growth and competitive conditions. On the other hand, the price of fixed capital, such as property, will be influenced by expected future income in different countries.  Even if construction costs have increased somewhat – and accelerated to some extent this year – it is primarily the price of land that has increased in Norway. Land is valued at a considerably higher level, while the price of the dwelling itself has not increased to the same extent.  Norway is now reaping the gains of the strong expansion of Asian countries and changes in the division of labour between countries. The improvement in Norway’s term of trade, coupled with high growth in productivity, has delivered very strong, positive income shocks to the Norwegian economy. It follows that land prices will rise at a faster pace than other prices. This is a real economic effect, which monetary policy cannot eliminate. In addition, both house prices and debt accumulation are affected by structural changes in capital and credit markets and by changes in lending willingness, demographic trends and migration patterns.  It is difficult to determine to what extent house prices have risen as a result of structural changes and wealth gains and to what extent house prices have been pushed up by expectations of a continued high rise in house prices. Developments since the beginning of the 1990s may have engendered expectations that house prices will only continue to rise. This may have increased house purchases for pure investment purposes and induced younger buyers to enter the housing market earlier than otherwise. The pronounced fall in 
BIS Review 102/2007 5 saving over the past few years indicates that households take greater chances. The housing market may have been in a state of euphoria.  We can influence house prices through the interest rate, but if the interest rate had been increased to a markedly higher level in order to curb house price inflation, the krone would have been significantly stronger and CPI inflation significantly lower. Yet it is low and stable inflation that is the operational target of monetary policy.  There is symmetry here as well. Should house prices fall sharply, we will in interest rate setting concentrate on dampening the effects on inflation and overall activity in the economy.  Nevertheless, through our communication, we have sought to take account of the possibility that debt and asset price developments may be a potential source of subsequent instability, but it is neither our ambition nor our conviction that monetary policy can control developments in these variables. Moreover, we have stated in clear terms that the interest rate has been unusually low and that it would have to increase gradually to a more normal level. Since 2005, this has been reflected in our own interest rate forecast. Since inflation expectations have been firmly anchored, we have also been able to increase the interest rate gradually even though actual inflation has been below target. The time horizon for reaching the target in our forecasts has been stretched. Let me now turn to economic models and their use.  Even though monetary policy cannot operate with objectives for developments in the labour market, asset prices or debt accumulation, these and other economic variables can provide information about future price developments, which is included in the basis for interest rate setting. In order to glean as much information as possible about future inflation and to gain insight into how the interest rate is affecting the economy, Norges Bank – like other central banks – uses economic models as an analytical tool. What makes a good model depends on the intended purpose of the model. The models' purpose must thus be given decisive weight in the choice and design of modelling tools.  The model must provide some indication of how the interest rate is working. We assume that Norway with its own national currency can determine inflation over time. One of our model requirements is therefore that monetary policy anchors inflation expectations. We must also take into account that economic agents look ahead when they make decisions concerning consumption, investment, wages and prices and base these decisions not only on today's economic policy, but also their expectations as to future policy. In addition, we build on theory and experience of the 1970s and 1980s indicating that in the medium and long term unemployment could not be reduced if we were only willing to accept somewhat higher inflation.  At a given point in time, we can on the basis of current statistics and anecdotal information provide some indication of how the economy has evolved up to a few months ago. But even this basis is uncertain. Statistics are prone to substantial revisions and data from different sources can provide different profiles for the same variable. For example, financial market statistics and national accounts statistics now show, as on many previous occasions, different profiles for household net lending.  In order to obtain a more accurate picture of today’s situation and developments over the next few quarters, we rely to a large extent on various statistical forecasting techniques. Such techniques and models can capture time series properties in data and correlations that in many cases feature a fairly high degree of accuracy without the model relationships following from economic theory. Norges Bank now devotes considerable resources to improving and developing our model apparatus for such “nowcasting”. We engage in extensive cooperation with researchers in Norway and abroad and with other central banks. Results and documentation of this work will be published in coming monetary policy reports and articles by researchers at Norges Bank.  
6 BIS Review 102/2007 In order to forecast somewhat further ahead, we must gain more insight into the forces at work and how they are affecting the economy. Statistical forecasting models, or models largely based on previous experiences, will be of limited help. For example, previous experience provides limited guidance in explaining the driving forces behind this cyclical upturn because of the many differences in relation to earlier periods.  A solid basis in economic theory is required to shed light on causal relationships. Norges Bank's work on models in recent years has aimed at constructing a theoretical macro model that can enhance our understanding of economic developments. By looking at households' and firms' behaviour, we can analyse the effect of changes of a more structural nature on the economy. In the model that has been given the name NEMO (Norwegian Economy Model), developments in the Norwegian economy can be explained among other things by changes in business technology, market structure in the product and labour market, household preferences with regard to work and leisure and monetary policy. A model will never be able to provide an exhaustive description of reality, but a good macro model can and should be a framework for ratiocination. In this way, the model plays an important role in the analytical basis for interest rate setting. At the same time, there are many questions and conditions about which we are uncertain and where models cannot help us. For example, we do not know whether the high rate of growth in productivity is a permanent phenomenon or whether it will gradually fall back. We have little precise knowledge about what is driving productivity growth. It may be that we are seeing a period of equilibrium with higher employment, lower unemployment and lower wage shares than earlier. But we are uncertain how long this period will last.  Even if we use different models and anecdotal information, we cannot escape the need for a healthy portion of qualified judgement when making forecasts and setting the interest rate. My experience from as far back as the 1970s is that in the event of major disturbances and structural changes in the economy, one essentially has to rely on general insights about the functioning of the economy. Models that rely heavily on regressions easily break down. As Mervyn King, the Governor of the Bank of England, stated explicitly to the point2: “..that’s what we have to do with every variable that we look at, work out why it’s growing faster or slower than it was before and not to use some rather mindless regression.…The secret of good policy is to try and think trough what are the economics of the shocks hitting the economy at present. That in a nutshell is my philosophy of how you should do policy. Don’t rely on regressions from the past.”  Having discussed the role of monetary policy and rather complex economic models, I will move on to the final theme which may seem more prosaic, notably measuring current inflation. In general, the production level of economic statistics is probably very high in Norway, as shown in international comparisons by the IMF among others. It would also seem that it is very cost-effective.  Improvements are frequently made to the methodology and the compilation of CPI statistics. In August this year, the indices for electricity, books and air travel were revised. Last year, Statistics Norway changed the method for the treatment of rents in the housing market, and the previous year the food index was revised.  A general view is that changes in statistics production should be well documented and should place particular emphasis on identifying the effects such changes might have on measured inflation. Furthermore, the statistics should be comparable, but not necessarily                                                  2  See Mervyn King, Governor, Bank of England on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the central bank's independence: (see Financial Times, Thursday, 3 May). 
BIS Review 102/2007 7 identical, across countries. It is positive that others are interested in and debate statistics production.3  With an inflation target for monetary policy, measuring inflation is of particular importance. CPI inflation is used as a reference in the wage negotiations each spring. Many financial contracts are linked to CPI inflation. A number of international studies have concluded that there are considerable measurement errors in official consumer price indices.4 The main criticism is that official indices are not sufficiently adjusted for changes in quality and that they do not capture consumers’ possibilities for shifting consumption away from the goods that show the fastest rise in prices. Many of the studies have concluded that consumer price indices overestimate the actual rise in prices. That is one reason why inflation-targeting countries set the target higher than zero. But there are also studies that point out that consumer price indices can underestimate the rate of increase for some components.  Against this backdrop, I will now discuss two particular notional concepts used in estimating the consumer price index in Norway to illustrate the uncertainty; how to impute rent for owner-occupied dwellings and how to measure clothing prices. A common method for imputing rent for owner-occupied housing is to apply the rent for a dwelling of an equivalent type, which is often referred to as rental equivalence. In addition to Norway, statistical agencies in Denmark, the US and Germany, among others, use imputed rent to calculate owner occupants’ housing costs in the consumer price index.  The consumer price index is designed to measure price developments for a stream of goods and services. It is the service the dwelling provides that the consumer price index is to capture. House prices are more like asset prices, such as share prices or bond prices. It may nevertheless be interesting to look at the relationship between house price and rents, at least in theory.  Let us assume that the rental market and home ownership market are in equilibrium. In this case, home rental prices will reflect the cost of owning a home.  What is included in the cost of owning a dwelling? The cost of acquiring a home must obviously be included and the financing cost is determined by the interest rate. Norwegian households primarily finance home purchases with floating-rate mortgages. Long-term interest rates are still important because they provide information about developments in short-term interest rates over time. The long-term interest rate is therefore the most relevant rate. Housing depreciation also has a bearing on user costs. Moreover, the expected increase in the price of a dwelling represents a gain that must be deducted from costs. If we now add and subtract expectations about the general rise in prices in the economy, we are left with the following four variables that have a bearing on user costs: house prices, long-term real interest rates, capital depreciation and expected real rise in house prices.5                                                   3  As did, for example, Knut Anton Mork, chief economist in Handelsbanken Norge, in the Norwegian financial daily Finansavisen on 25 August. 4  See for example Lebow, David E. and Jeremy B. Rudd (2003): “Measurement Error in the Consumer Price Index: Where Do We Stand?” Journal of Economic Literature, vol. XLI, pages 159-201, or Boskin, Michael J., Ellen R. Dulberger, Robert J. Gordon, Zvi Griliches og Dale Jorgenson (1996): “Toward A More Accurate Measure Of The Cost Of Living.” Final report to the Senate Finance Committee, Advisory Commission to Study the Consumer Price Index, 4 December 1996 or Gordon, R. J. (2005): Apparel price 1914-93 and the Hulten/Brueghel paradox, NBER Working Paper 11548. 5  For purposes of simplification, capital gains tax of 28 per cent is disregarded. Interest rate expenses are tax deductible, while capital gains on the sale of a dwelling are not liable to tax if the dwelling has been owned for more than 12 months and the dwelling has been occupied by the owner for at least 12 of the 24 months prior to sale. Any losses are tax deductible only if any capital gains are liable to tax. 
8 BIS Review 102/2007 Let us assume that capital depreciation is fairly constant. We can then expect parallel movements in house prices and rents and in user costs, if expectations concerning long-term interest rates and real house price inflation are stable.  But actual house prices have doubled since the latter half of the 1990s in relation to the rise in house rents in the consumer price index. Between 50 and 70 per cent of this change is probably ascribable to a fall in the expected level of real interest rates. Viewed over the past 5-10 years, the expectation as to what a neutral real interest rate is may have fallen by close to 2 percentage points. This may be because expectations concerning future inflation in our economy and the world economy have become far more stable, with a smaller inflation premium on the real interest rate, and because we are in a period with unusually ample flows of savings from Asian and oil-producing countries, which have driven down interest rates.  At the same time, house price inflation expectations have been high in recent years. Such expectations will push down user costs, and hence rents. As a result, we must expect some difference between developments in house rents and house prices in periods. Rents can lag behind to a fairly large extent during an upturn, and only pick up when house price inflation expectations stagnate or fall.  In Norway, the number of rental properties is small in relation to the total stock of housing. The rental market in outlying areas, which now indirectly has a larger weight in the CPI, is thin. Hence, the rental market does not necessarily provide a representative expression of owner-occupants’ housing costs.  It is difficult to estimate the cost of owner-occupied housing. The harmonised index of consumer prices for the euro area, which the ECB uses as its measure of inflation, has not included owner-occupied housing so far. Nor do many of the national consumer price indices in the EU include this component.  This is clearly not a good solution because housing costs normally account for a large portion of households' total cost of living. Eurostat, the European statistical agency, has therefore initiated a pilot study where they use the net acquisition approach.6 This approach is different from our method in that the treatment of purchasing a house for owner occupation is the same as for all other goods in the consumer price index. Only the household sector’s net acquisition of dwellings is included. In other words, purchases of dwellings bought from other private households are excluded. In addition, expenditures related to major repairs and conversions of a dwelling, and other expenditures such as estate agent fees, indirect taxes and insurance are also included in the acquisition approach. Land is treated as an asset and excluded.  If European countries switch to including housing costs estimated using the acquisition approach, it will be natural for Norway to publish a comparable index for consumer prices, cf. figures based on Eurostat’s current method are also presented in Norway. In practice, housing costs for owner occupants based on the acquisition approach will move closely in line with construction and maintenance costs. They would probably be given a somewhat lower weight in an overall index over time than imputed rent in the CPI in Norway today. The chart shows developments in the construction cost index and developments in imputed rent in the CPI, which is based on developments in the rental market. The two indices have risen at about the same rate in recent years, but have diverged since summer 2006. Higher prices for both labour and building materials have pushed up the rise in construction costs. In August 2007, the 12-month rate of increase in construction costs was 7.9 per cent, while the 12-month rate of increase in imputed rent was 1.5 per cent.                                                   6  See Eiglsperger, M. (2006) The treatment of owner-occupied housing in the harmonised index of consumer prices. IFC Bulletin 24, 68-79. 
BIS Review 102/2007 9 A change from imputed rent to the acquisition approach may change the path for the CPI over the business cycle. While rents probably react with a lag, movements in the rate of increase in construction costs will be more coincident with cyclical developments.  Prices for clothing can also be difficult to calculate. As measured by the CPI, clothing prices in Norway have fallen markedly over the past few years. This may reflect the removal of import quotas, reduced tariff rates, a shift in imports towards Chinese goods and improved efficiency in retail industry. These changes have also had an impact in other countries. Clothing price developments in Norway have nonetheless followed a different path compared with Sweden and other European countries, with the exception of the UK.  Trade in clothing in Sweden and Norway has many features in common. We have many of the same shop chains, and trade in both countries is increasingly concentrated on chain stores. Even though Norway has gone somewhat further in removing trade barriers, and even though the price level in Norway was initially relatively high, the question may still be raised as to whether there is reason to expect such wide differences in clothing prices in the two countries year after year.  It is difficult to measure changes in clothing price. Although a clothing article often has a high introductory price, the price falls after a relatively short period. Sales activity is high. The range of goods changes frequently. A large share of the assortment in a shop is typically replaced in the course of 3-4 months. Changes in quality are difficult to define and identify.  In Norway, it is the shops themselves that report clothing prices and changes in quality, which are used as a basis for the clothing price index in the CPI. In Sweden and many other countries (Denmark, Ireland, the UK), price inspectors perform this task. In Sweden, statistical methods are also used to calculate changes in quality.  It may be that some of the difference in the rise in clothing prices in the two countries is due to the way prices are measured and interpreted rather than to actual price developments. This is also supported by Eurostat’s price level survey.  Eurostat compares different countries’ prices for identical goods and finds that the level of clothing prices in Norway has in fact risen somewhat compared with clothing prices in Sweden in recent years. According to the CPI in the two countries, clothing prices in Norway have fallen by 30 per cent relative to clothing prices in Sweden in the period 1999-2005. The goods measured in Eurostat’s survey are probably not representative of the basket of consumer goods in Norway. The survey nonetheless illustrates the uncertainty surrounding actual developments in clothing prices.  Allow me to conclude. Inflation in a country with its own national currency is not something that just drifts in with the wind from abroad. It is monetary policy that over time determines the nominal path. In the short and medium term, we can weigh the variability in inflation against the variability in output and employment. Nevertheless, the overriding objective is to anchor expectations of low and stable inflation. We must never lose sight of this. There is considerable uncertainty surrounding the economic situation and economic developments ahead. Statistical forecasting techniques and macroeconomic models can help us gain further insights into and a better understanding of the driving forces, but can obviously not eliminate risk and uncertainty. Measuring inflation is no trivial matter and should, like monetary policy, be reviewed and discussed and be open and transparent. Measured as a ten-year average, inflation is now 2.0 per cent. Given the uncertainty surrounding the economic situation, the projections and the measurement of inflation, this is quite close to the target of 2.5 per cent.  Thank you for your attention.

V Leeladhar: India’s preparedness for Basel II implementation Address by Mr V Leeladhar, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the panel discussion during the “FICCI-IBA Conference on Global Banking: Paradigm Shift”, Mumbai, 13 September 2007. *      *      * Dear Friends,  It is my pleasure and privilege to be here with you this morning and to be sharing my experience and views with this august audience regarding India’s preparedness for Basel II implementation. I am very thankful to the organisers for having afforded me this opportunity today. As you are well aware, implementation of the new capital adequacy framework has been a long and exacting journey in most of the jurisdictions, and so is the case with India. The countries are at various stages of implementation. In India, having regard to the country context and in tune with the overall approach to regulatory reforms, we have adopted a calibrated approach for a phased implementation of Basel II so as to secure a non-disruptive migration to the new framework. In my remarks today, I would like to briefly touch upon the evolution of the revised framework, its broad structure, preparatory measures taken by the RBI for implementing this framework and the challenges that will need to be tackled in migration to Basel II. At the outset, let me hasten to add that while we are moving towards the Basel II Framework, the RBI has adopted a three-track approach to capital adequacy regulation in India, with the norms stipulated at varying degrees of stringency for different categories of banks. Similar differentiated approach has been adopted in some other jurisdictions also. This has been a deliberate choice for us having regard to the size, nature and complexity of operations and relevance of different types of banks to the Indian financial sector, the need to achieve greater financial inclusion and to provide an efficient credit delivery mechanism. Thus, the commercial banks, which account for the lion’s share in the total assets of the banking system, will be on Basel II standards while the co-operative banks will remain on Basel I norms for credit risk with surrogate measures for market risk. The Regional Rural Banks, on the other hand, which have limited operations in rural areas, will be on non-Basel standards.  Basel II The attempts at harmonising the capital adequacy standards internationally date back to 1988, when the “Basle Committee on Banking Regulations and Supervisory Practices”, as it was then named, released a capital adequacy framework, now known as Basel I. This initiative set out the first internationally accepted framework for measuring capital adequacy and a minimum ratio to be achieved by the banks. This norm was widely adopted in over 100 countries, and in India, it was implemented in 1992. Over the years, however, the Basel I framework was found to have several limitations such as its broad-brush approach to credit risk, its narrow coverage confined to only credit and market risks, and non-recognition of credit risk mitigants, which encouraged capital arbitrage through structured transactions. Moreover, the rapid advances in risk management, information technology, banking markets and products, and banks’ internal processes, during the last decade, had far outpaced the simple approach of Basel I to measuring capital. A need was, therefore, felt to replace this Accord with a more risk-sensitive framework, which would address these shortcomings.  Accordingly, after a wide-ranging global consultative process, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) released on June 26, 2004 the document “International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards : A Revised Framework”, which was supplemented in November 2005 by an update of the Market Risk Amendment. This document, popularly known as “Basel II Framework”, offers a new set of international BIS Review 102/2007 1 
standards for establishing minimum capital requirements for the banking organisations. It capitalises on the modern risk management techniques and seeks to establish a more risk-responsive linkage between the banks’ operations and their capital requirements. It also provides a strong incentive to banks for improving their risk management systems. The risk sensitiveness is sought to be achieved through the now-familiar three mutually reinforcing Pillars.  The Pillar 1 stipulates the minimum capital ratio and requires allocation of regulatory capital not only for credit risk and market risk but additionally, for operational risk as well, which was not covered in the previous Accord. The Pillar 1, unlike the previous Accord, provides a menu of approaches, from the simplified to the advanced ones, for determining the capital charge for each of the three categories of risks. The credit risk mitigants used by the banks have been specifically recognised to provide appropriate capital relief.  The Pillar 2 of the framework deals with the “Supervisory Review Process” (SRP), and is probably not that well understood as the other two Pillars. In fact, this is the element which makes the revised framework very comprehensive in its sweep by addressing the entire risk domain of the banks. Let me elaborate a little. It requires the banks to develop an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) which should encompass their whole risk universe – by addressing all those risks which are either not fully captured or not at all captured under the other two Pillars – and assign an appropriate amount of capital, internally, for all such risks, commensurate with their risk profile and control environment. Under the Supervisory Review, the supervisors would conduct a detailed examination of the ICAAP of the banks, and if warranted, could prescribe a higher capital requirement, over and above the minimum capital ratio envisaged in Pillar 1.  The Pillar 3 of the framework, Market Discipline, focuses on the effective public disclosures to be made by the banks, and is a critical complement to the other two Pillars. It recognises the fact that apart from the regulators, the banks are also monitored by the markets and that the discipline exerted by the markets can be as powerful as the sanctions imposed by the regulator. It is premised on the basic principle that the markets would be quite responsive to the disclosures made and the banks would be duly rewarded or penalised, in tune with the nature of disclosures, by the market forces.  Preparatory measures for Basel II implementation  Let me now say a few words about the process adopted in India for implementation of Basel II. Though the Indian banks became fully compliant with Basel I Accord in March 2005, the RBI had initiated preparatory measures even prior to that. In August 2004, soon after the new framework was released by the BCBS, the banks were advised to conduct a self-assessment of their risk management systems and to initiate remedial measures, as needed, keeping in view the requirements of the Basel II framework. Further, to secure a consultative and participative approach for a non-disruptive migration to Basel II, a Steering Committee was constituted in October 2004, comprising senior officials from 14 select banks (a mix of public sector, private sector and foreign banks). It formed several sub-groups to address specific issues under Basel II and made its recommendations to the Reserve Bank. Based on these inputs, in February, 2005, the RBI issued the draft guidelines, for public comments, on implementation of Pillar 1 and Pillar 3 requirements of the Basel II framework. In the light of the feedback received from a wide spectrum of banks and other stake holders, the draft guidelines were revised and again placed in public domain on March 20, 2007 for a second round of consultations. Keeping in view the additional feedback received, the guidelines were finalised and issued on April 27, 2007. As regards the Pillar 2, the banks have been asked to put in place the requisite Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) with the approval of their Boards.  I may mention here that even before the final guidelines were issued, the RBI had asked the banks in May 2006 to begin conducting parallel runs, as per the draft guidelines, so as to 2 BIS Review 102/2007 
familiarise them with the requirements of the new framework. During the period of parallel run, the banks are required to compute, parallely, on an on going basis, their capital adequacy ratio – both under Basel I norms, currently applicable, as well as the Basel II guidelines to be applicable in future. This analysis, along with several other prescribed assessments, is to be placed before the Boards of the banks every quarter and is also transmitted to the RBI. These reports received in the RBI indicate that implementation of Basel II in the banks is in the process of getting stabilised.  The minimum capital adequacy ratio prescribed under the Basel II norms continues to be at nine per cent, at solo as well as consolidated level. This, however, is subject to the stipulated prudential floors for the first three years of implementation to guard against any significant decline in the capital ratios of the banks arising from the capital relief that they might accrue to them under Basel II. The banks are, however, expected to operate at a level well above the minimum capital requirement. The banks are also required to achieve the Tier I capital ratio of six per cent not later than March 31, 2010, both on solo as well as consolidated basis.  A two-stage implementation of the guidelines is envisaged to provide adequate lead time to the banking system. Accordingly, the foreign banks operating in India and the Indian banks having operational presence outside India are required to migrate to the Standardised Approach for credit risk and the Basic Indicator Approach for operational risk with effect from March 31, 2008. All other Scheduled commercial banks are encouraged to migrate to these approaches under Basel II in alignment with them, but, in any case, not later than March 31, 2009. It has been a conscious decision to begin with the simpler approaches available under the framework. As regards the market risk, the banks will continue to follow the Standardised-Duration Method, already adopted under the Basel I framework, under Basel II also.  Thus, reckoning the well-planned and carefully-sequenced preparatory work already done, the choices exercised by the RBI under the national discretion, coupled with a phased implementation schedule, I am inclined to believe that the Indian banking system could be considered to be in a high state of preparedness and would be well poised for a seamless migration to Basel II next year, in tune with the envisaged timeframe. This, however, is not to say that the process would be a cake-walk – as there would be considerable challenges too that lie head for all of us, during the current phase of implementation as also for moving to the advanced approaches.  The challenges ahead  Let me now briefly outline some of the salient issues and challenges that might arise for the Indian banking system from the adoption of the Basel II framework. The list here is, however, by no means exhaustive.  First, the new norms might, in some cases, lead to an increase in the overall regulatory capital requirements for the banks, particularly under the simpler approaches adopted in India, if the additional capital required for the operational risk is not offset by the capital relief available for the credit risk. This would of course depend upon the risk profile of the banks’ portfolios and also provide an incentive for better risk management but the banks would need to be prepared to augment their capital through strategic capital planning. Second, the Standardised Approach for credit risk leans heavily on the external credit ratings. While the RBI has accredited four rating agencies operating in India, the rating penetration in India is rather low. Moreover, credit rating in India is confined to rating of the instruments and not of the issuing entities as a whole. Besides, the credit rating provides only a lagged indicator of the credit standing of an entity, and is not a lead indicator. The banks would, therefore, need to actively reckon this aspect in their ICAAP exercise.  BIS Review 102/2007 3 
Third, the risk weighting scheme under Standardised Approach also creates some incentive for some of the bank clients to remain unrated since such entities receive a lower risk weight of 100 per cent vis-à-vis 150 per cent risk weight for a lowest rated client. This might specially be the case if the unrated client expects a poor rating. The banks will need to be watchful in this regard.  Fourth, the new framework could also intensify the competition for the best clients with high credit ratings, which attract lower capital charge. This could put pressure on the margins of the bank. The banks would, therefore, need to streamline and reorient their client acquisition and retention strategy.  Finally, implementing the ICAAP under the Pillar 2 of the framework would perhaps be the biggest challenge for the banks in India as it requires a comprehensive risk modelling infrastructure to capture all the risks that are not covered under the other two Pillars of the framework. The validation of the internal models of the banks by the supervisors would also be an arduous task.  In regard to adoption of advanced approaches available under Basel II, the RBI has not stipulated any timeframe for adoption of these approaches but a migration to advanced approaches would certainly pose significant challenges to both – the banks as well as the supervisors. In this case, a slightly different set of issues and challenges is likely to arise which would need to be kept in view in any decision to migrate to them.  First and foremost, the banks will need to demonstrate to the supervisors that they meet the minimum criteria stipulated in the Basel II framework to be eligible to adopt the IRB approaches. This could require, inter alia, suitable adjustments in the risk-rating design and its operations for various product lines in the banks as also the governance structure to ensure the integrity of the rating process.  Second, unlike the simpler approaches under Basel II, the advanced approaches are very data intensive and require high-quality, consistent, time-series data for various borrower- and facility-categories for a period of five to seven years to enable computation of the required risk parameters (such as default probability and loss given default, etc.). The banks would perhaps need a thorough review of their internal processes with a view to redesign and upgrade them to be able to capture the information needed for creating the requisite databases.  Third, a robust risk management architecture, including a strong stress-testing framework for scenario analyses, would be a necessity under the advanced approaches. A system within the banks to validate the accuracy of the internal rating processes would be an essential element of the risk management set up.  Fourth, an overarching requirement for efficient data management and for effective risk management structures, would be an state-of-the-art technological infrastructure which might need significant investment and improvement to achieve seamless enterprise-wide integrated risk management, for which sharply focused strategic planning would be necessary.  Fifth, with considerable leeway available to the banks under the advanced approaches in determining the regulatory capital requirements, the highest standards of corporate governance would be critical for maintaining the integrity of the advanced approaches.  Sixth, the complexity of advanced approaches requires highly skilled staff and the human resource management in the banking industry, particularly for the public sector banks, could emerge to be a binding constraint, in adopting advanced approaches. This would need innovative strategies and concerted efforts on the part of the banks to be able to attract and retain the right mix of talent in the organisation.  Finally, the advanced approaches would also cast an onerous responsibility on the supervisors of not only guiding the banking system through the implementation phase but 4 BIS Review 102/2007 
also of validating the internal models, system and processes adopted by the regulated banks. This, needless to say, would require considerable capacity building and augmentation of the domain knowledge and expertise of the supervisors themselves to ensure a non-disruptive migration to the advanced approaches under Basel II. Let me hasten to assure all of you that we, in the RBI, are quite live to the issue and strategic interventions have already been planned in this regard.  Conclusion I have provided a brief overview of the Indian approach to implementing Basel II framework and the state of preparedness of the banks in India. Let me conclude by reminding those present here that the Basel II framework provides significant incentives to banks to sharpen their risk management expertise to enable more efficient risk-return trade offs; it also presents a valuable opportunity to gear up their internal processes to the international best standards. This would require substantial capacity building and commitment of resources through close involvement of the banks’ Top Management in guiding this arduous undertaking. It is, no doubt, a demanding and daunting task, both for the banks as also the supervisors, but I am sure that with concerted and dedicated efforts of all of us, we would be able to measure equal to the task and cross yet another important milestone in our journey of successfully implementing the regulatory reforms in the country.  Thank you.  BIS Review 102/2007 5 
Jean-Pierre Roth: Switzerland – a platform for global business Summary of a speech by Mr Jean-Pierre Roth, Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank for International Settlements, at the Forum de l'Economie vaudoise, Lausanne, 14 September 2007. The complete speech can be found in French on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). *      *      * Within the past ten years, Switzerland has become a genuine platform for global economic operations. From here, the international markets are being worked systematically, and an ever-growing part of our economic performance is now attributable to investment activity abroad. This is a welcome development since it allows us to keep high value-added jobs in Switzerland. However, it also involves some risk because the international mobility of production has increased. Consequently, the general conditions which help to keep Switzerland attractive as a business location must be maintained.  This platform for global economic operations has given us a role outside the European Union and the euro area. Thus we have chosen to face the challenge of globalisation instead of the challenge of European integration. Our path may be demanding, but it is also promising! BIS Review 101/2007 1 
Martín Redrado: The Argentine response to the financial turmoil Speech by Mr Martín Redrado, Governor of the Central Bank of Argentina, at the Euromoney conferences, London, 13 September 2007. *      *      * The first thing that came into mind when I was drafting this speech was to explain the basis of our monetary and financial strategy and to what extent it has contributed to promote macroeconomic stability over the last years.  I must admit, paradoxically, that the financial turmoil of the lasts weeks gave me a big hand. This is the first time, as in many other Latin American countries, the whole macroeconomic program – which includes our global monetary and financial policy strategy – is under stress.  So, this stress test provides us with a unique opportunity to witness our policies in action. It also allows us to assess the internal consistency and intertemporal sustainability of our approach. As markets have come under pressure, emerging economies have shown general resilience. But, not all are in the same category.  In a de-leveraging scenario, countries with solid economic fundamentals (or “liquidity suppliers”), which include large fiscal and current account surpluses, flexible exchange rate regimes and abundant foreign reserves are likely to outshine the “liquidity consumers”.  As we analyze the behavior of this asset class, Argentina’s performance in the monetary, financial and exchange rate markets shows that we are in the first camp. In a nutshell, our country is riding the storm due to better macroeconomic management. We have established a new framework that, in my view, is going to last for the next decades. It is based on the interaction of five pillars:  1. Fiscal solvency; 2. External sustainability; 3. A prudent and consistent monetary policy that ensures the equilibrium between supply and demand in the monetary market; 4. Countercyclical financial policies. They include active FX accumulation and management. Moreover, the development of a sound and well-matched financial system acts as a buffer against any turmoil; and 5. A managed floating exchange rate regime. Let me elaborate upon the interaction of these pillars and how they are key to keep the economy moving to its long-term equilibrium.  Firstly, fiscal accounts show a surplus, boosted by increased tax revenues. The primary balance currently stands at almost 3.5%, achieving five consecutive years of budgetary discipline. As a result, the ratio of debt to gdp continues to decline. Financing requirements are manageable in a context of restrained access to capital markets for emerging market economies.  Secondly, since 2002 the current account balance is projected to remain positive in 2007 for six consecutive years, an unprecedented event since the mid-1940s.  Argentina is taking advantage of structural changes in the world economy that yield high commodity prices for several of its exporting products. This fact, combined with factors such as the abundance of natural resources, a reasonable infrastructure and the high level of BIS Review 101/2007 1 
education standards, put the country in an interesting competitive position in the global economy.  Shipments of manufactured products (of both agricultural and industrial origin) are leading the growth of exports.  This increase has occurred together with a greater diversification in terms of products and, especially, destinations. This has been boosted by a very active trade policy pursued over the last years to open and diversify markets.  For example, the number of countries Argentina sells its products has grown steadily from 159 in 1999 to more than 190 in 2006. This factor clearly helps mitigating the risks associated with adverse shocks in some of our trade partners. And, despite a likely deceleration in the US and, probably, in Europe, I am not expecting a significant shift away from this scenario any time soon. Today, commodity prices depend almost exclusively on the long-term equilibrium between supply and demand in each particular market. And these balances have been virtually unaffected by recent financial turmoil.  Especially, for soft commodities, where demand seems to be immune to recent developments. In fact, agricultural prices have shown persistent upside movements recently associated with a structural change: a sustained growth in demand (rather than negative supply shocks as in other times in history).  Steady demand is based on higher consumption from emerging market economies worldwide. The middle east, southeast Asia and Latin America are delivering the best economic performance of the last decades. Together, they act as a positive factor that balances (and also mitigates) the prospective weakness in the US and Europe.  Wheat prices, for instance, showed a new record high last month explained by higher demand coming from the emerging world (mainly India). This will keep inventories low and the ratio stock-consumption at minimum levels. Escalating shipments have also their grounds on the increasing use of agricultural products such as corn as inputs for producing substitutes to fossil fuel (to be consumed in industrial countries).  According to recent USDA studies, corn needs for energy demand will grow, in quantity, more than the world’s total production for, at least, the next five years.  This phenomenon contributes to sustain high quotes. As a by-product, it affects food prices overall due to its impact on the cost of producing meat and dairy products.  Consequently, we are experiencing higher food prices worldwide. The impact on inflation is particularly large in developing countries, where foodstuff usually has a higher weight in the consumption basket (and, consequently, a higher weight in cpi).  Additionally, in these countries, cereals dominate the daily diet (according to FAO, cereals represent 52% of the diet in developing economies compared to only 31% in the developed world).  However, emerging market economies – both foods exporters such as Argentina and many other countries in Latin America and consumers, including many Asian countries – are also facing sustained increases in food prices. Therefore, the twin surpluses (fiscal and external) have been a trademark of the Argentine economy over the last years and are expected to remain so. As opposed to what happens in other emerging markets, being able to show a positive cash flow that comes from the real side of the economy together with a flexible exchange rate regime and a solid central bank gives the country a paramount position to face external turbulences.  2 BIS Review 101/2007 
Nevertheless, on the fiscal side, the consolidated primary balance reached an outstanding 5.3% in 2004 to decline about two percentage points to current levels. Going forward, a commitment to increase the primary surplus is essential to keep a sustainable growth towards equilibrium.  So, the need to preserve and deepen these surpluses is a priority. Mainly, because we are still going through a transition phase typical of post-crisis periods. And, these transition stages – where key macroeconomic variables converge to their long-term values – take time and raise enormous challenges. For instance, it took long to countries such as Chile to fully stabilize their economies and achieve sustained growth. Our neighbor put in place a gradualist approach during the normalization period. It involved four common elements that have been of utmost importance: consolidating fiscal solvency, reestablishing external sustainability, restructuring liabilities, and rebuilding the financial system.  Once all these aspects were addressed, progress in the consolidation of a full-fledged inflation targeting regime was achieved. Thus, for several years, Chile lived with higher inflation, while patiently building credibility and institutions.  So, the experience of other emerging economies shows that flexibility and gradualism in both policy design and implementation are the adequate approach during this phase of their history.  In Argentina, despite a notable recovery, several features of the current macroeconomic performance indicate that the economy is still heading towards a new long-term equilibrium. Neither in our history nor in the international experience is possible to find precedents for the 2001-2002 crisis.  Unlike the case of Brazil, Mexico or southeast Asia, the abandonment of the convertibility regime included simultaneously an institutional breakdown, a huge devaluation, the destruction of the financial system and the default on the public debt.  In addition, the country has a long history of macroeconomic instability. Monetary regimes have unsuccessfully shifted from one extreme to the other. While in the eighties money supply grew vis-à-vis the financing of the fiscal deficit, in the past decade, the rigidity of the convertibility regime was neither consistent with the structure of the economy nor with the government fiscal behavior.  There are several examples of the normalization phase that is still taking place: monetary transmission channels are just being rebuilt, since credit to the private sector accounts for only 11 percent of the economy, still far below the Latin American average.  Therefore, patiently rebuilding the power of monetary policy and developing the required infrastructure is an important step towards consolidating growth and stability. Meanwhile, monetary and financial policy should be conceived under a general equilibrium approach, where fiscal solvency, the monetary balance and external sustainability are mutually determined.  So, the Argentine economy is simply at different a stage after the crises compared to the current situation in other Latin American countries.  Thus, hasty diagnosis and, as I heard from many analysts, simplistic comparisons among the various countries’ situations may lead to inappropriate policy recommendations. The path towards an effective inflation targeting regime is a sequential one. Building strong pillars is the track of a Central Bank that operates strategically. Under these circumstances, a sustainable and long-lasting reduction of the inflation rate in Argentina depends on the comprehensive, joint and coordinated action of the monetary policy, the fiscal policy, the wage policy, and the competition policy during the transition phase.  BIS Review 101/2007 3 
And this, takes me to the last three pillars I mentioned, which are the outcome of the monetary and financial strategy set by the central bank of Argentina over the last years. In fact, the turbulences we are experiencing today has enabled us to see our monetary and financial policy strategy in action: • A prudent and consistent monetary that ensures the equilibrium between supply and demand in the monetary market. • Countercyclical financial policies. They include active FX accumulation and management and a sound and well-matched financial system that acts as a buffer against any turbulence. • A managed floating exchange rate regime. Far from being erratic, each move in this strategy has been in line with the intertemporal goals of equilibrium in the monetary market, the preservation of the value of currency and the stability and depth of the financial system. I say “intertemporal” because the central bank has “an across-the-cycle” view rather than a short-term one. In the first place, our policy guarantees the stability by ensuring the equilibrium between supply and demand for money. Thus, we see that the current regime of control over money supply combines the necessary doses of monetary prudence (as shown by sixteen running quarters of compliance with self-imposed monetary aggregate targets) and flexibility (which has enabled us to weather recent turbulences). We have consolidated the monetary policy scheme based on the control of money supply since it is the most adequate for an economy in transition, which still makes intensive use of relatively liquid means of payment and has a relatively low bank penetration.  The strategy is implemented through various instruments which allow us to absorb the supply of pesos derived from our FX accumulation policy. This aggressive policy is feasible because the central bank has a strengthened balance sheet and positive annual results.  Instruments include the placement of securities at fixed and floating rates, the repo market, the reserve requirement policy, and the early payment of rediscounts. The latter resulted from central bank incentives and led to a significant monetary absorption over the last years.  We have also been working to deepen the repo market and to empower its interest rate as a reference policy tool. We have been gradually but persistently hiking this rate. Since 2005, the interest rate on 7-days repo operations has increased by more than 500 basis points, acting as an important absorption instrument.  Recently, we have established a regular auction mechanism to provide daily liquidity and we have expanded the universe of securities taken as underlying assets for these operations.  What does the recent trend in money supply reflect? M2 shows a downward trajectory, with a steep fall in its year-over-year change in 2007-2006 vis-à-vis growth rates in 2003 and 2004. In fact, for the first time after the crisis, the money supply is growing below the nominal gdp. These are clear indicators of our monetary policy prudential bias.  Also, state-owned banks have started to manage their liquidity more in line with the rest of the financial system. Let’s recall that they hold 26 billion pesos of liquidity from the various government agencies of which about 10 billion pesos are still on sight deposits.  This prudent monetary stance contributed to achieve a more stable macroeconomic position. The different measures of core inflation that we track are showing today very similar monthly variations to those experienced in 2006: around 0.7% on average; ranging between 0.4% and 0.9%. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2007 (last data available), the gdp deflator grew below the average of 2006.  Then, through the full use of all available instruments, we have contributed to the stabilization in core inflation while fostering the stability of the financial system.  4 BIS Review 101/2007 
But, make no mistake on this: the Central Bank is concerned about current levels of inflation. There is no reason for complacency.  As a consequence, further joint work between fiscal, monetary, wage and competition policies needs to be done to make sustained progress over the next years. Prudential FX accumulation is another example that speaks for itself. As with every insurance policy, it represents an “abstract” benefit while it is not used, but a “concrete” one in situations of financial stress: the $43 billion of external liquidity in the Central Bank’s coffers are enough to discourage speculation.  An additional element of the strategy developed in the past few years to face contingencies is the recovery of banking liquidity and solvency. Due to an improved regulatory framework, we developed a sound financial system today that acts as a “turbulence buffer” rather than “amplifier”.  Just as reserves play the role of liquidity insurance to the monetary authority, banks’ cash is the first defense line against unexpected events. For this reason, banking regulations fostered the recovery of liquidity, equivalent to almost 40 percent of total deposits, one of soundest of the region. To strengthen our monetary and financial system, we have also adopted measures that are producing what I consider to be one of the major breakthroughs in our history: a system that is independent from the public sector, and that takes and trades in domestic currency, with a lender of last resort that also lends in domestic currency.  In this regard, we have set strict guidelines to reduce exposure to the national, provincial, and municipal public sectors. Ceilings have been established based on the capital of each institution and on the relevant jurisdiction. In addition, an overall maximum restriction was set at 35 percent of each bank’s total assets, which is fully effective now. As a result, banks’ exposure to the public sector accounts for less than 17 percent of total assets, vis-à-vis around 50 percent during the crisis.  Besides, we took specific measures to prevent those who cannot repay in us dollars from borrowing in that currency, encouraging the development of the credit market in domestic pesos. This action not only strengthened the stability of the system but also crowded-in the private sector, helping to deepen the market. In a context of high growth of credit to firms and households, the non-performing portfolio has hit an all-time low.  The system has already shown profits for a couple of fiscal years now, and the process of capitalization and extension of terms for liabilities has been gathering momentum. Thus, we now have a financial system that is more mature and better prepared to face any sort of disruption. Lastly, the current managed floating exchange rate regime has been at the core of our monetary and financial strategy. On the one hand, it avoids ensuring a “foreign exchange insurance” that favors the inflow of hot money. On the other, it aims to prevent short-term volatility from affecting spending, savings and investment decisions.  And it has been proven that this is the most adequate scheme for this transition towards long-term equilibrium in our economy. Under a free float, the exchange rate would have reached significantly higher quotations, running serious risks of going back to the devaluation-inflation dynamics that has been so recurrent throughout argentine economic history. Our actions included the – sequential and combined – adoption of a set a tools – monetary, exchange and financial regulation measures – that dodged every possible inflationary impact while injecting liquidity to the system. On the foreign exchange side, the Central Bank has coordinated the intervention with state-owned banks and has acted aggressively through the futures market to stabilize the exchange rate.  BIS Review 101/2007 5 
We also resorted to the use of monetary and financial regulation instruments: buying back our own securities in auctions and in the secondary market, optimizing the strength of bills and notes auctions according to the prevailing liquidity conditions and intensifying operations in the repo market through transparent auctions, among others. All in all, Central Bank actions show us the consistency and effectiveness of our strategy. We proved to have the necessary “artillery” to preserve money and exchange market stability and, at once, a wide variety of tools to maneuver in the face of turbulence showing clear symptoms of permanence in time.  Moreover, we have proven our commitment to price stability (with the limitations derived from the instruments we have at hand in this transition stage) from an intertemporal approach, that is, looking through the economic cycle. This is the only conceivable course of action for a Central Bank with a strategic vision. In my view, this framework has been extremely useful in a transition phase to achieve a five-year cycle of high and continued economic growth with social inclusion. Now, it is the time to strengthen and calibrate it to take us to the next level: the challenge is to turn this framework into permanent policies with long-term parameters.  The development of pluri-annual targets for monetary, fiscal and wage policies in order to set up a predictable horizon for long-term investment is an example of the tools that this next stage requires. Looking ahead, an investment rate of, at least, 25% of gdp will be needed to sustain current levels of economic growth over time, helping to attain price stability at the same time.  For this purpose, the harmonization of the whole set of instruments of economic policy should be oriented to protect the purchasing power of national income. It is all about, focusing on macroeconomic stability but from an “across-the-cycle” perspective to achieve a sustainable economic policy over time. Otherwise, all efforts will be vain and we will be trapped in the typical Argentine pendulum, swinging from one end to another of the spectrum of potential policies with no continuity whatsoever. In fact, we face a synchronic challenge: achieving sustained growth and building institutions simultaneously.  To implement these policies effectively for the benefit of future generations, the only possible way is to keep the consistent and gradualist approach to build the right infrastructure so that there is no way back.  The most successful stories are those of countries that understood how important was to reconcile goals with instruments.  Especially, in a stage such as this one, where the combination of fundamental economic policy tools is what will allow us to achieve a gradual and long-lasting reduction of inflation in a context of economic growth that includes all our citizens. Thank you. 6 BIS Review 101/2007 
Lars Nyberg: Monetary and financial stability from a central bank perspective  Speech by Mr Lars Nyberg, Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, at the conference on the 10th Anniversary of the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Sarajevo, 13 September 2007. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen, What is the interaction of monetary and financial stability? This is one of the most discussed issues in central banks and academia today, and is likely to remain high on the agenda for the foreseeable future.  Many central banks, including the Swedish Riksbank, now have dual tasks: maintaining price stability and promoting financial stability. I will begin by discussing these tasks separately, and then turn to the questions the success in bringing down inflation has raised with regard to financial stability, and how this has influenced the conduct of monetary policy in Sweden. Before proceeding, I should stress that the views I am about to express are my own, and do not necessarily reflect those of the other members of the Executive Board of the Riksbank. Moreover, it should be kept in mind that my remarks primarily are based on my own experiences from an inflation targeting central bank, operating in a small open economy.  Price stability The taming of inflation, after the destructive price-wage spirals of the 1970s and 1980s, is one of the major success stories in modern economic policy making. Economic theory tells us that high inflation is bad for a number of reasons. These theories now appear to have been vindicated. The last decade has seen strong global economic growth, while, at the same time, output volatility have dropped.  In practice, two paths have emerged for achieving price stability. One way is through a fixed exchange rate regime, such as a currency board. Under such an arrangement, a country simply imports the monetary policy of a country with a highly credible low-inflation regime. This path has emerged as the weapon of choice of many emerging economies. These countries want to achieve price stability, while avoiding the costly deflations which otherwise might be necessary to anchor inflation expectations. The other way is through an independent central bank with a mandate to maintain price stability. This mandate is often formulated in terms of an inflation target. The inflation target operated by the Swedish Riksbank stipulates that consumer price inflation should be 2 per cent per year, with a tolerance interval of plus/minus 1 percentage point. For all practical purposes this arrangement is close to what is found in, for example, the UK, Australia, Norway and the Eurozone. It should also be said that there is a general consensus that the inflation target in Sweden has been a successful one. Financial stability As I mentioned earlier, many central banks today also have an objective to promote financial stability. While there is close to universal agreement on what price stability means, there has yet to emerge, some attempts none withstanding, a consensus on a working definition of BIS Review 101/2007 1 
financial stability.1 Given the problems in defining and measuring financial stability, why should we pay any attention to it? One answer is that we simply cannot afford not to do so, as financial crises carry with them huge costs to society. This was shown by events in Japan and the Nordic countries during the early 1990s, and in much of South East Asia in 1997. In fact, one could even claim, that financial stability takes precedence over price stability, in the sense that the latter is quite irrelevant if the financial system is on the brink of collapse.  An important difference between price stability and financial stability is that while responsibility for price stability rests squarely on the central bank, financial stability necessitates the cooperation of the central bank, supervisors and the government. However, the exact roles played by different authorities differ from country to country. Another difference is the number of instruments available to policy makers. In the case of price stability, there basically exist one instrument (either the short-term interest rate or the nominal exchange rate). Maintaining financial stability, on the other hand, requires a wide spectrum of policy measures, such as professional supervision, a legal framework that does not encourage “moral hazard”-type behaviour and crisis management plans.  A recent complication is the surge in cross border banking activities, which means that the national authorities engaged in financial stability work, increasingly must work with their foreign colleagues. While the internationalisation of the banking industry holds the potential for efficiency gains, and increased household welfare, it has also added a score of new challenges. Perhaps the most serious of these challenges is what has been termed the home-host problem. This can, in all its essence, be described as follows: Suppose a bank, which is of marginal importance in its home country, sets up a branch in another country, which turns out to be systemically important for that country. Given that the bank is not important in its home country, the home supervisors, who have responsibility for the supervision, might not think that the bank merits close supervision. However, for the host country, which will foot the bill for the salvage operation in case the bank fails, the incentives to monitor the bank are huge. This dilemma is not new in theory, but has now become of great practical importance as financial globalization progressively is making national borders less relevant. Asset prices, financial stability and monetary policy Are there instances when these goals come into conflict with each other? This question has become particularly relevant in the last few years as asset prices have surged, while, at the same time, consumer price inflation has remained muted.  On the whole, I think it is reasonable to assume that price stability in the long run reinforces financial stability. The main reason for this is that low and stable inflation reduces the risk of misallocating investments. Although I believe that low inflation fosters financial stability, it would be wrong to disregard the possibility that changes in the inflationary process can have unintended consequences for the stability of the financial system. The success in bringing down inflation has lowered both nominal and real interest rates. Moreover, factors such as the integration of emerging markets into the world trading system, and high productivity growth, has put downward pressure on prices of manufactured goods. This may have induced key interest rates to be lower, than what otherwise would have been justified in this cyclical position of the economy.  Given the fact that the low inflation regime has yielded high and stable growth, in conjunction with low interest rates, it is no wonder that asset prices have surged. While much of this price movement is fundamentally based, there is a risk that households and firms might become too optimistic about future earnings and interest rates. Put differently, there is a risk that                                                  1  See e.g. Schinasi, G. (2004): ”Defining Financial Stability”, IMF Working Paper, WP/04/187. 2 BIS Review 101/2007 
asset prices rise to unsustainable levels during the transition from a regime with high inflation to a regime with low inflation.  Another, but not unrelated issue, concerns how risk is priced in the credit markets. The last few years saw risk premiums in credit markets falling to record low levels. The fall in risk premiums meant that the effect on asset prices were more important than what the changes in the risk free rate alone would suggest. While low risk premiums, taken at face value, signal a healthy economy, many supervisors and central banks were concerned that risk premiums had fallen too far. As we all know, risk premiums in credit market rose dramatically this summer. Uncertainty over the value of US subprime mortgage backed securities then ignited a furious “flight-to-quality”, which actually seized up important segments of the money market. It is too early to tell what the permanent outcome of these events will be. However, it is clear that if they signal a return to higher risk premiums and tighter credit conditions, asset price inflation is likely to slow down. The area where the current regime of low interest rates and small risk premiums has had its most marked impact is probably that of residential property and household debt. The rise in house prices the last ten years have indeed been unprecedented in duration, magnitude and synchronisation across countries. In Sweden, this has caused a substantial amount of public concern, and an often asked question is if there is a significant overvaluation in the housing market and if the households are overly indebted. Answering these questions is a daunting task, and requires an educated opinion on the equilibrium price of residential property and on the optimal level of household indebtedness. Such assessments are further complicated by the fact that there have been a number of important structural changes in the mortgage markets. Without going into detail, weighing the available evidence together, we do not think that residential property in Sweden is significantly overpriced in general. Nor do we believe that households in general are overly indebted. However, this does not preclude the possibility that there are other countries where house prices and household indebtedness have risen to levels beyond what can be fundamentally motivated.  Yet, even if we don’t believe that house prices and household indebtedness have been disconnected from their fundamental drivers, there are still reasons for us to be concerned by the rise in property prices and household indebtedness. In the last years, in Sweden as elsewhere, household debt has grown much faster than disposable income. Obviously, this is not sustainable in the long run, as households then ultimately would be unable to service their debts. In the long run it is likely that indebtedness and house prices will increase roughly at the same rate as the nominal growth of the economy. This type of adjustment, to more restrained growth rates, will normally occur smoothly, as households begin to feel that their finances cannot tolerate a higher level of indebtedness. However, if there is an overly sharp correction or “hard landing” if you like, it could lead to weak growth in the economy for a long period of time. In this case, it would also have effects on inflation.  So, in short, in Sweden a situation has prevailed where subdued inflationary pressures have called for an expansionary monetary policy, while, at the same time, property prices have been surging in a fashion that in no way can be deemed as sustainable. How can, and should, a central bank in a small open economy with an inflation target deal with such a situation? The first thing a central bank can do is to engage in “open-mouth operations” and constantly remind everyone of the existence of the risks through speeches and documents. One publication that can prove particularly useful in this regard is the Financial Stability Reports, which are now published by an increasing number of central banks. By taking a systemic view of the financial system, the Financial Stability Reports investigate the collective impact stemming from the actions of individual financial institutions. By communicating these findings to market participants and the general public, the central bank can raise awareness of risks to financial stability, which might otherwise go unnoticed. BIS Review 101/2007 3 
But, at times, all this may not be enough, and then the inevitable question begs to be answered – How, if at all, should a central bank let changes in asset prices influence its monetary policy? The Riksbank runs a flexible inflation target, which means that we also take the real economy into account when we set interest rates. Changes in, for example, property prices are routinely taken into account in such a framework since the trajectory of the policy rate for the forecast horizon is set by the outlook for inflation and output, and these outlooks are affected by changes in property prices among other things.  However, it is close to impossible to properly quantify, or capture the risks, of overly sharp corrections of property prices some time in the future. We therefore have to take risks of that kind into account in a different way than in the normal approach, where the forecasts for inflation and the real economy serve as the foundation. This is done by adjusting the timing of the policy rates changes, for example by raising the policy rate somewhat earlier than would be justified by the forecasts for inflation and the real economy. By doing so, we hope to minimize the probability of a hard landing scenario.  Concluding remarks  If I were to sum up my experiences from the last few years, I think three conclusions can be drawn.  First of all, as long as asset price inflation only is deemed to be a macroeconomic risk, it can be addressed within the framework of a flexible inflation target. If it is deemed to be a threat to the stability of the financial system, the brunt of the policy response would not be on monetary policy, but rather on the regulatory side.  Secondly, I think that the problem of how to manage the risks from asset prices in the monetary policy decision process to a large extent is pedagogical, i.e. explaining that we do not target asset prices, but that we do not completely ignore them. However, monetary policy is a topic on which a lot of people have an opinion, and you are never going to please everyone. In fact, in recent years the Riksbank has been criticized for putting either too much, or too little, emphasis on property prices.  Finally, I would like underscore the necessity of stress-testing the banking sector for sudden shifts in property prices. You can have a whole staff of PhDs running all kinds advanced models telling you that assets are not overvalued. That’s fine, but at the end of the day they might be wrong, and then you would like to know what the consequences are going to be for the banking system.  Let me end by thanking the central bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina for hosting this conference and congratulate the bank on its 10th anniversary. 4 BIS Review 101/2007 
David Dodge: A clear case for transparency Remarks by Mr David Dodge, Governor of the Bank of Canada, to the Canada-UK Chamber of Commerce, London, UK, 12 September 2007.  *      *      * It has been about 26 months since I last spoke to you here in London and certainly, much has changed in the world since then. We have seen a remarkable continuation of robust global growth, fuelled by increases in international trade and facilitated by the continuing evolution and expansion of capital markets. Domestic demand began to grow more strongly in Europe and Asia and to slow in the United States, and this began to ease some of the concerns related to global imbalances that I spoke about during my last visit.  However, credit spreads continued to narrow, and lending standards loosened through the early part of 2007, while the growing use of structured financial products increased the distance between investors and underlying credits. Although central bankers raised concerns over the past 18 months or so about the pricing of credit and whether it appropriately reflected risk, it was not until the late spring of this year that spreads on risky assets began to widen, triggered largely by concerns related to the market for U.S. subprime mortgages. In August, concern turned into consternation, as investors in structured products – especially asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) – "discovered" that U.S. subprime mortgages might be included in the assets underlying their products. Compounding this consternation was the worry that counterparties might be in a weaker financial state than previously anticipated, because of their own exposure to these assets. This led to a tightening of conditions and to dislocations in money markets more generally. One key factor behind the recent troubles in the money markets was, I believe, a lack of transparency. Transparency can, of course, mean different things in different contexts. In terms of financial markets, I am referring to the ability – as well as the willingness – of participants to obtain and use full and timely knowledge of market activity, including the precise nature of what is being traded. It was living through the events of August, in combination with ongoing efforts by the Bank of Canada to strengthen the functioning of international financial institutions, that has led me to use my remarks today to make a clear case for transparency. In doing so, I will not limit my comments to financial markets. Transparency is an underlying theme that pervades much of what policy-makers should do, both domestically and internationally. So, I will begin my remarks with a discussion of financial markets and how a lack of transparency has contributed to the market dislocations that we have seen recently. I will then return to a theme I spoke about when I was last here – the importance of strengthening our international financial institutions and increasing the transparency of their advice and operations. Finally, I'll say a few words about the health of the Canadian economy.  Financial markets: the need for transparency Let me begin my remarks by recalling the 2005-06 period, when many central bankers – including me – were becoming concerned with what appeared to be an excessive easing of credit conditions, or what was described as a "wall of liquidity" building up around the globe. What was creating this wall of liquidity? Well, as I mentioned the last time I was here, at its very base was a global excess of desired savings relative to desired investment. These excess savings were acting to drive down real longer-term interest rates, even during a time when many central bankers were raising policy interest rates.  As longer-term interest rates declined, investors intensified their search for better returns. This search for yield led to a narrowing of spreads on risky assets. As well, there was a BIS Review 100/2007 1 
loosening of lending standards in some markets, as lenders became more willing to take on risk. It also provided the opportunity for an increase in the issuance of structured products. Packaging and selling loans with a structure that allowed higher-risk assets to take on the qualities of a lower-risk loan fuelled the demand for higher-risk assets and embedded significant leverage. This financial engineering was a factor that spurred merger and acquisition activity, including corporate takeovers by private equity firms, as well as lending in markets such as the market for subprime mortgages in the United States.  In many cases, these structured products have become increasingly complex and more difficult for investors to understand. The securities often made use of leverage and contained layers of derivatives on top of various types of assets; assets that were packaged and repackaged, sold and resold, in a myriad of forms. In this complex process, transparency about the underlying credit was often lost. Because the originators of the loans intended to securitize them rather than leaving them on their balance sheets, they lacked the incentives to carefully assess the creditworthiness of the borrower. And investors often lacked the ability, or did not make the effort, to see through the complexity of the instrument. Thus, investors were unaware of the creditworthiness of the root asset and the potential difficulties with the liquidity of the instrument itself. Compounding the problems was the fact that the models upon which these structured products were valued assumed that they could be readily traded in a liquid market. In August, that assumption was tested and found not to be fully warranted. I do want to emphasize that there were significant benefits to the development of these new, complex instruments. They provided the ability to separate different types of risk, such as credit or market risk. This promoted better risk management and allowed these risks to be borne by those best able to do so. Both banks and non-banking institutions created different types of loans that could be packaged and sold to different investors across the global economy. And taking many loans off balance sheets enhanced the ability of the banking sector to originate new loans while remaining well capitalized.  As I mentioned earlier, central bankers had been worried for quite some time that credit spreads were not appropriately reflecting risk. So, we welcomed the re-pricing of risk that began in the spring of this year. Indeed, by May, we saw spreads on high-yield corporate bonds and emerging-market bonds beginning to widen to levels closer to historical norms. We also saw a re-pricing of U.S. subprime mortgages to reflect rising delinquency rates. This process meant that some people who had taken on a great deal of risk had to face losses. But in general, the necessary re-pricing of risk was proceeding, and markets were functioning properly.  In August, however, the process hit a fairly major bump in the road. To begin with, we saw that the spread of the risks inherent in structured products also meant a wide dissemination of any underlying problems associated with the assets at the root of these instruments. Moreover, the complexity and lack of transparency in many of the structured products added to the market dislocations. It was extremely difficult for investors to peel back the layers of these securities and derivatives to determine, with confidence, both the creditworthiness of the assets backing a particular security and the market value of the security itself. Even supposedly sophisticated investors became extremely uncertain and that, in turn, led to fear. Such fear made markets less liquid – the money market in particular – and the "wall of liquidity" evaporated under the summer sun. Investors sought shelter and security in the least risky, shortest-term, and most transparent assets. The re-pricing of credit risk is an ongoing process. Unfortunately, it may take somewhat longer than in previous periods, because of the opacity and legal complexity of so many of these structured products. All of this implies that it's too early to draw any definitive conclusions from the current experience. But one lesson, which I hope will be clear to everyone, is the absolute importance of transparency if markets are to function properly. Vendors of financial instruments need to structure these investments in such a way that 2 BIS Review 100/2007 
market players can clearly see what they are buying. Credit-rating agencies need to clearly indicate that their ratings for highly structured products should not be used with the same degree of certainty as their ratings for conventional, single-name issuers. At the same time, investors will have to take on more responsibility for diligent research, so that they can better understand the nature of their investments and demand greater transparency where it is now lacking. Investors should not rely simply on the pronouncements of rating agencies to deliver their seal of approval! Instead, they must do their own homework and make a concerted effort to understand what they are buying. However, this process can be successful only if they have access to all the information they need.  Now I want to spend just a few minutes discussing the role of central banks, and the Bank of Canada in particular, during August. As liquidity dried up, central bankers in many parts of the world quite appropriately became involved. Many central banks injected short-term liquidity into money markets where required, fulfilling two fundamental roles.  First, it is absolutely normal and proper that central banks should provide liquidity when banks that are quite solvent are faced with markets that have become illiquid – a point that Walter Bagehot recognized more than a century ago. Banks need to know that they can access the central bank's liquidity facilities when required. At the Bank of Canada, our Standing Liquidity Facility is available at the end of day, and can be accessed at a penalty rate of 25 basis points above our target for the overnight rate, by institutions that can pledge a broad range of easily priced securities as collateral. Following the onset of the market dislocations, we increased our supply of settlement balances as we normally do when we see increased demand for cash balances. Our second very fundamental role is to conduct our monetary policy in a transparent way to keep our policy interest rate close to its target, in order to control inflation. The events of August put strong upward pressure on the key overnight rate that we use in the conduct of monetary policy. And so we carried out open market buyback operations to inject liquidity in order to maintain that rate. We also temporarily expanded the list of securities eligible for use by market participants in these buyback operations.  All told, our actions in these roles were effective in improving the functioning of the overnight money market. So we have now restored our original list of securities eligible for use in buyback operations, and we have gradually reduced the level of settlement balances. I want to be absolutely clear on one point: The actions that we took to provide liquidity to support the smooth operation of financial markets did not in any way signal a change in our monetary policy. In fact, it was a step in maintaining our monetary policy stance by keeping our target for the overnight rate at 4 1/2 per cent, which we judged appropriate for keeping inflation on target over the medium term.  But while the overnight market in Canada is well on its way back to normal operations, this does not mean that all of the problems in money markets have been resolved. Term funding remains somewhat expensive, and the yield spread between bankers' acceptances and treasury bills remains abnormally wide. With respect to the market for asset-backed commercial paper, Canada – like other countries – has seen some problems. One specific segment of the Canadian ABCP market – the market for third-party, or non-bank-sponsored, structured finance, asset-backed commercial paper – has had particular problems. This represents roughly one-third of Canada's about $120 billion ABCP market. At the core of the difficulty are the guarantees of liquidity behind these securities, which differ from the guarantees provided in the United States and Europe. Canadian third-party ABCP tends to include a clause that guarantees liquidity only in the event of a "general market disruption." Many, but not all, of the liquidity providers have declined to step in as this paper has come due, essentially saying that the continued operation of some parts of the commercial paper market indicates that there has not been a general market disruption. Efforts to resolve problems in the market for third-party ABCP are under way. Discussions between investors BIS Review 100/2007 3 
and liquidity providers – most of whom are international banks – are continuing in Montréal. And I remain hopeful that, over time, we will see useful results. The balance of Canada's ABCP is composed of conduits sponsored by Canada's major banks. These banks have agreed to provide global-style liquidity support to their conduits. But they have not been immune to both global and local problems. As a result, the banks' conduits have been rolling over at shorter terms and higher interest rates and, in some instances, the banks have been taking some maturing paper onto their balance sheets. Nevertheless, the major banks appear to be well placed to deal with the current dislocations. In a joint statement last month, these institutions said that their commitment to support the ABCP market is underpinned by the strength of their financial positions, their confidence in the underlying assets, and their ongoing commitment to provide liquidity for their conduits upon maturity. Further, data published by Canada's Superintendent of Financial Institutions show that our domestic banking sector is well capitalized. At the Bank of Canada, we welcomed this effort to help re-establish well-functioning money markets in Canada. And we are confident that our banks have the capacity to continue to support their conduits as necessary. Institutional transparency I said earlier that one of the lessons of the events of August is the absolute importance of transparency if debt markets are to function properly. But the importance of transparency is not limited to money markets and debt instruments. In my view, there is a clear case for transparency more generally in the operation of all financial markets. In most countries there are fairly clear rules requiring transparency in the operation of mutual funds, so investors can tell what they are purchasing. Hedge funds, by their nature, are less transparent. But there is also, I believe, a clear case for increased transparency, at least with respect to their objectives, operating procedures, and governance. The objective of accounting standards is also to increase transparency. But it is very difficult for firms to put a precise value on complex instruments for reporting purposes. For many of these instruments, there is no well-established market against which they can be marked. And the models against which these instruments are valued are simply that – statistical models that can only generate estimates of value within what is often a wide range. This means that it is very important for firms to be transparent about the methods used to estimate values and about the range of possible values around these estimates. Let me now say just a few words about the importance of transparency in government-sponsored institutions, whether domestic or international. I will begin with a few words about sovereign wealth funds, which control increasingly large amounts of money and are significant global financial forces. Some of these funds, such as the public pension funds in Canada, already adhere to very high standards of transparency. But in other cases, there is often insufficient transparency in the operation of these funds. Too often, the objectives behind these funds are not clearly defined, and this can lead to misconceptions about their motives, particularly those that have their origins in foreign exchange reserves. As is the case with private pools of capital, high standards of transparency for reporting and governance, as well as objectives, would be helpful for these public pools of capital. Finally, I would note that the same need for transparency applies to our international financial institutions. In this vein, we at the Bank of Canada, along with our colleagues at the Bank of England, have been working to promote a strengthening of the surveillance capacity and governance practices of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). As work continues to improve surveillance, we must also be expanding our efforts to help to make the IMF a truly representative institution for countries around the world, by ensuring that emerging-market economies have an appropriate voice within the institution. As well, we must ensure that the Fund is governed in a transparent way, and that the Managing Director and staff are accountable for the work that they do. 4 BIS Review 100/2007 
Canada's economic health Before concluding, let me say a few words about Canada's economic situation. Canada has enjoyed roughly 15 years of sustained economic growth, with low and stable inflation and increasingly healthy public finances. Our unemployment rate is the lowest it has been in about 30 years, and a greater proportion of the population is now working than ever before. At least part of the credit for our continued economic performance should go to our sound framework for macroeconomic policy, which includes the transparent monetary policy of inflation targeting that I mentioned earlier, as well as a sound fiscal policy.  Over the past five years, robust global demand – particularly for energy and other primary products – has been a key contributor to solid economic growth in Canada and a significant improvement in our terms of trade. Overall, the Canadian economy has been adjusting well to changing relative prices, supported by our flexible exchange rate regime. Labour has shifted from areas and sectors where there is less demand to those where demand is greater. For about the past three years, the Canadian economy has been operating near, or above, its production potential. Strong economic growth has led to rising incomes across the country. The market for skilled labour is tight throughout Canada, but especially in the western provinces. In these circumstances, there has been some upward pressure on inflation. Against this backdrop of rising incomes and employment, it is not surprising that housing sales and prices have continued to rise, despite Canada's more conservative mortgage-lending practices.  What do we see as we look ahead? The Bank's last full economic projection was conducted for the Monetary Policy Report Update that we published in the middle of July. In that document, we projected continued strong economic growth outside North America and somewhat slower growth in the United States over the next several quarters. In that context, our base-case projection for Canada was for average annual economic growth of about 2 1/2 per cent through 2009, slightly below our estimate for the growth rate of potential. This would allow the economy to return to its production potential in 2009. Inflation was projected to return to its 2 per cent target by early 2009. Recent developments suggest that the near-term economic prospects for the United States are weaker than earlier expected. It now seems likely that the adjustment in the U.S. housing sector will be more pronounced and more protracted, exacerbated by the dislocations in financial markets. This implies weaker demand for Canadian exports than had been earlier expected. However, economic growth in Canada in the first half of this year turned out to be stronger than we had projected. And so at our fixed announcement date last week, we said that the Canadian economy now appears to be operating further above its production potential than we had estimated in July. Domestic demand remains robust, buoyed by our continued strong labour market and higher-than-expected increases in housing sales and prices. But recent developments in financial markets have led to some tightening of credit conditions for Canadian borrowers, which should temper the growth of domestic demand. Against this background, we judged that the current level of our target for the overnight interest rate – 4 1/2 per cent – is appropriate. However, there are significant upside and downside risks to the outlook for inflation. On the upside, there is a possibility that household demand in Canada could be stronger than anticipated, while on the downside, the ongoing adjustment in the U.S. housing sector could be more severe and spill over to the U.S. economy more broadly. In addition, there is uncertainty about the extent and duration of the tightening of credit conditions in Canada and, hence, about the tempering effect this will have on the growth of domestic demand. Conclusion Let me conclude. Dislocation in financial markets is not easy to deal with, and it is certainly not welcome. But if we can learn and retain the extremely valuable lessons from these BIS Review 100/2007 5 
events, particularly in terms of the critical importance of transparency, then global financial markets can emerge from these events stronger and more efficient than before, to the benefit of us all. 6 BIS Review 100/2007 
Jarle Bergo: Will strong growth in the banking industry continue? Views on the balance of risks  Speech by Mr Jarle Bergo, Deputy Governor of Norges Bank (Central Bank of Norway), at a banking industry seminar on primary capital certificates, Oslo, 13 September 2007. The text below may differ slightly from the actual presentation. The address is based on the assessments presented at Norges Bank’s press conference following the Executive Board’s monetary policy meeting on 15 August, Financial Stability Report 1/07 and on previous speeches. *      *      * Thank you for inviting me to this seminar on primary capital certificates to give an introductory speech on developments in the banking industry and the balance of risks. As we all know, there is a strong global focus on financial institutions and financial markets at present, with frequent use of words such as "turbulence", "problem" and "crisis". I will spend some time on the background to these developments and try to assess the possibility of similar problems in Norway. I will also point to other risk elements that the industry should bear in mind. First, however, I will give a brief review of the economic situation in Norway and how this has affected the banking industry. The Norwegian economy and the financial sector The Norwegian economy is now in a cyclical upturn. Over the past three years, mainland GDP has grown by approximately 4½ per cent annually, and this high rate of growth has continued in 2007. In the first half of the year, annualised growth was close to 6 per cent, and even if GDP growth in the third and fourth quarters should be zero, annual growth will be well over 4 per cent. As the chart shows, a four-year period of such strong growth has not been seen since 1971. The strong rate of growth has only to a limited extent fed through to a higher rise in prices for consumer goods and services. Consumer price inflation adjusted for tax changes and excluding energy products (CPI-ATE) has admittedly picked up gradually since late summer 2006, but in relation to the economic situation, underlying inflation remains low. After hovering around 1-1½ per cent over a longer period, the year-on-year rise in the CPI-ATE was 1.8 per cent in August. Other measures of underlying inflation show approximately the same rise in prices. The year-on-year rise in the total consumer price index (CPI) has been just under ½ per cent in recent months. This is because electricity prices have been substantially lower this year than last year. There are a number of reasons why inflation has been low in an environment of high economic growth. First: Norway’s terms of trade have improved. Prices for export goods such as oil and gas, freight, fish, industrial commodities and engineering products have increased considerably. In addition, market growth abroad has provided market opportunities for Norwegian export goods. At the same time, Norwegian importers have been able to shift demand to new markets in central Europe and Asia, which has led to a fall in prices for many imported consumer goods. The terms of trade have improved by about 40 per cent since 2002. This has resulted in a vigorous rise in Norway's disposable income. Even excluding oil, there has been a marked improvement. Second: An ample supply of labour has boosted output growth. In particular, the supply of foreign labour has increased sharply after EU enlargement in 2004. Over the past two years, these labour inflows have accounted for over 30 per cent of growth in the labour force in Norway. At the same time, this has enabled Norwegian companies to be bolder in accepting new assignments and making investments, in the knowledge that they can procure labour BIS Review 100/2007 1 
throughout Europe. High inward labour migration and the scope for relocating portions of production abroad have led to increased competition in the labour market and have probably curbed wage growth. Third: The Norwegian business sector has been quick to adopt new technology and to reap the benefits. In comparison with other countries, productivity gains in service sectors stand out in particular. On balance, these factors have contributed to the economy’s high capacity for growth. But strong activity growth has now resulted in a high level of capacity utilisation. Shortages of labour and other factor inputs have been reported. This may curb growth in the Norwegian economy and lead to higher wage and cost inflation. Inflation is expected to pick up ahead. The upturn has also benefited the financial industry. Strong economic expansion has pushed up an already high level of lending growth. As a result, total assets in Norwegian banks and mortgage companies have risen sharply over the past decade. Growth in lending to households has been high since 2000, but growth in corporate lending showed a sharp rise towards the end of 2005. Profitability in the financial industry in Norway has been high. What is the outlook ahead? Will strong growth continue? The strong rate of growth we have witnessed in the past few years is not sustainable over time. Capacity utilisation is very high with labour shortages in many sectors. Monetary policy must be oriented to bringing inflation up to target while avoiding an overheating of the real economy. The scenario ahead, then, is a continued upward adjustment of the interest rate while curbing the high rate of economic growth. It is likely that credit growth will gradually slow, and this may also pose challenges for banks. I will return to this later. Risks to financial stability in Norway In Norges Bank’s most recent Financial Stability report, published in June, we concluded that the overall outlook for financial stability was satisfactory. We nonetheless highlighted a number of factors that might constitute a risk. In connection with international risk factors, we placed emphasis on the uncertainty surrounding international economic conditions and the concern about the low risk premia in financial markets. I think it is fair to say that developments have borne us out here. Other risk factors were related to the vulnerability of Norwegian bank customers, lower interest margins for banks and the new capital adequacy rules.  Uncertainty surrounding developments in international economic conditions and financial markets There has recently been considerable turbulence in international financial markets. Could this have a substantial impact on Norwegian financial markets and could it have serious consequences for growth and employment in Norway? Let us look at the reasons for the turbulence and how it has spread.  The source of the turbulence can be found in the US housing market and particularly in the subprime mortgage market. In addition, this type of loan is frequently offered at a low rate of interest with small repayments in the first years of the loan term and a higher interest rate later. Mortgages with this structure involve gambling on a rise in house prices. If house prices rise, borrowers’ collateral will increase in value, allowing the mortgage to be refinanced on better terms. Or the borrower can turn around and sell the dwelling at a profit. This is what happened for a period, but then house price inflation slowed, partly as a result of tighter monetary policy.  The fall in house prices towards the end of 2006 and in 2007 resulted in rising defaults on mortgages, especially in the subprime segment. In 2007 and 2008, interest rates will 2 BIS Review 100/2007 
increase for a substantial portion of the most recently granted subprime mortgages. This will probably result in a further rise in defaults on these mortgages. Housing starts have also declined considerably. The sharp fall in housing investment has reduced the annual rate of US economic growth by about ¾ percentage point on average over the past year and a half. Housing market developments in the US may result in a more sluggish trend in private consumption and may further amplify the tendency to slower growth in the US, which may spread to the global economy. At the moment, the spillover effects seem to have been moderate and downward revisions of growth estimates have been modest. In the US, more than half of total mortgage debt is securitised and sold to investment managers all over the world. This is one of the largest fixed income markets in the world and accounts in volume terms for almost 10 per cent of global securities debt. Subprime securitised issuance showed a sharp rise in 2004 and increased further in 2005. Estimates of subprime mortgages as a share of the total volume of securitised mortgages in the US are uncertain and vary from 12 to 18 per cent. In the chart, the share is 12 per cent, or USD 665 billion.  One reason for the popularity of securitised subprime mortgages was the development of collateralized debt obligations, CDOs, based on portfolios of these mortgages. The rating agencies have been actively involved in developing these products. Mortgages were often packaged in such a way that the securities in the most secure or senior tranches were given an AAA rating. This gave the subprime market access to funding from insurance companies and other investment managers that otherwise would not have invested in this market. High lending growth would probably not have developed without this type of financing. The securities in the least secured tranche (equity tranche) were in demand from investors seeking high returns, such as hedge funds. It has been difficult to price CDOs. As a rule, the issuer has calculated a fair value using complicated mathematical models. Because of the pricing difficulties, there has been little trading in these securities since their issue. This has resulted in problems for funds interested in selling, or who were forced to sell. In winter 2007, the rise in defaults on subprime mortgages resulted in a sharp increase in credit spreads for bonds backed by this type of mortgages. The credit spread for bonds backed by subprime mortgages rose further in June in the wake of problems in two funds specialising in investment in this kind of bonds. Credit premia also increased for other fixed income instruments, such as conventional mortgage bonds, corporate bonds and loans to emerging markets, from summer 2007, although on a far more moderate scale than for subprime-backed securities. In the last half of July, the turbulence spread to other financial market segments. The risk premium required by investors rose, and equity prices fell sharply. The contagion was due to uncertainty as to the risk subprime-backed financial products represented for the financial system, and to a lack of information about who had invested in such products.  Conduits and Structured Investment Vehicles (SIVs) were among the investor groups investing in the financial products based on subprime mortgages. As a rule, these investment companies were wholly or partially owned by banks. They invested in assets with a high rating, such as the senior tranche in subprime-backed securities. These investments were debt-financed, primarily in the short-term money market through asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP). High ratings on these assets gave investment companies favourable funding rates. Due to the turbulence in the subprime market, interest rates for ABCP have risen sharply and maturities have been reduced. The flow of money to investment companies through money markets has dried up. Banks have to a large extent had to finance the investment companies themselves. However, this increases banks’ liquidity requirements. There have been examples of banks that did not have the capacity to finance their investment companies. BIS Review 100/2007 3 
Due to uncertainty as to which financial institutions were exposed to the subprime market, many operators became very cautious about extending loans, and this eventually also led to liquidity problems in the interbank market. On 9 August and in the days ensuing, many central banks offered extra liquidity to safeguard liquidity in the banking system. Norges Bank supplied liquidity to the Norwegian banking system through ordinary market operations on 9 August. In many countries, the money market is still dependent on injections of extra liquidity from the central bank. The banking system’s capacity and willingness to redistribute funds is still moderate. This increases banks’ financing costs. The turbulence in the financial markets has also led to a sharp rise in prices for transferring credit risk, i.e. credit default swaps (CDS), for both banks and other companies. CDS prices for US banks rose for the first time in March and began to rise again at end-June. Developments in CDS prices for European banks lagged behind somewhat, but in the last half of July CDS prices rose sharply for both US and European banks. This also affects Norwegian banks and enterprises, but the increase in CDS prices for DnB NOR was considerably lower than for European banks on average.  Kredittilsynet (Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway) announced at the end of August that financial market turbulence seems to have had little impact on Norwegian banks. Kredittilsynet’s analyses showed that Norwegian banks are not directly exposed to the subprime market and that they have limited exposure to hedge funds. Norwegian banks have some indirect exposure through their regular connections with foreign banks and credit institutions that are more exposed to subprime mortgages and hedge funds than their Norwegian counterparts. However, general liquidity problems in international money markets might also affect Norwegian banks and lead to higher funding costs. To some extent, this has in fact happened. Norwegian money market rates have risen relative to the risk-free interest rate, but less than in the major economies. It is uncertain how sensitive risk premia will be in the event of higher demand for funding. The price of obtaining dollar liquidity seems to have increased, and this also affects Norwegian banks. Since the end of June, the yield curve in the Norwegian money market has become steeper at the short end. Two- and three-month rates have risen more than the other money market rates in this period.  We do not know how long the turbulence will last or what the consequences will be for the real economy. So far, the turbulence has not resulted in substantial reassessments of the international outlook for economic growth. The OECD has revised down its growth estimates for 2007 somewhat, particularly for the US and some European countries, and the IMF has indicated that it will do the same. Uncertainty with regard to 2008 is probably greater, but the turbulence seems to have had little impact on emerging economies so far, with the prospect that strong growth will continue in the world economy as a whole. The turbulence has led to a fall in short-term interest rate expectations, particularly in the US. Long-term interest rates have also declined. Interest rate expectations have also fallen somewhat in Norway. Covered bonds  Norwegian banks and mortgage companies have also been given the right to securitise mortgages. Will this lead to developments similar to those we have seen in the US? The rules for covered bonds entered into force on 1 June 2007. These bonds give the bondholder a preferential claim in relation to a specified selection of a mortgage company’s assets. DnB NOR, Terra-Gruppen and the SpareBank 1 group have all established their own covered bonds companies for this purpose. So far mortgages that have been transferred from banks to this type of mortgage institution have a high level of security. Because of this high level of security, the new type of bond is expected to have a somewhat lower yield than traditional 4 BIS Review 100/2007 
bank bonds, which is likely to reduce banks’ total funding costs. DnB NOR Boligkreditt and Terra Boligkreditt have both issued covered bonds.  In addition to lower financing costs, the reason why banks establish mortgage credit institutions is that the assets in a mortgage credit institution can easily be converted to liquidity by issuing covered bonds. Norwegian covered bonds are very different from US CDOs backed by subprime mortgages. The regulations ensure that Norwegian covered bonds are a more transparent and substantially more secure investment alternative. The cover pool in the mortgage credit institutions consists of mortgages with a maximum loan to value ratio of 75 per cent. The loan to value ratio of the cover pool in Norwegian mortgage credit institutions that have so far issued covered bonds is well below this. All holders of covered bonds have the same right to the mortgage credit institution’s cover pool. In other words, there is no tranching as is the case for CDOs backed subprime mortgages. Investors will also have an overview of the risk parameters for mortgages that are part of the cover pool. This means that Norwegian covered bonds are far more transparent with respect to the assets that are the bondholders’ cover than CDOs backed by US subprime mortgages.  Another difference between subprime mortgages in the US and Norwegian mortgages is that the regulations relating to the provision of credit are stricter in Norway. Subprime mortgages in the US have been sold through agents and mortgage brokers that have not been subject to federal supervision. In a number of cases, mortgages have been extended to persons with no income. Before Norwegian banks extend a loan, they assess a customer’s debt-servicing capacity. Norwegian banks are also required to advise a customer against taking out a mortgage if they feel that the customer will find it difficult to service the loan.  Risk factors related to domestic conditions Events that have taken place abroad are actually more a liquidity crisis rooted in uncertainty about the valuation of assets and the distribution of losses among institutions than a crisis due to the size of the losses themselves. The credit risk for the more senior tranches of subprime CDOs is probably manageable. But we should not forget credit risk in the traditional sense when we assess risk elements. Loans to Norwegian households and enterprises account for approximately 70 per cent of banks’ balance sheets. Risk factors related to these customer groups are therefore very important to financial stability in Norway. Households Strong household debt growth and the sharp rise in house prices constitute a risk factor with regard to financial stability in Norway. Household debt growth has been high since 2000, primarily driven by low interest rates and a sharp rise in house prices and income. Loans secured on dwellings have shown high and increasing growth. Strong competition between banks has pushed down lending margins. The new capital adequacy rules (Basel II), which involve a substantial reduction in risk weights for mortgages, may also have contributed to the rise in mortgage growth and the decline in lending margins. Real house prices, deflated by consumer prices, building costs and house rents, are historically high. Deflated by disposable income, however, house prices have only risen moderately over the past ten years. In recent months, there have been signs of a slackening in the housing market. The rise in house prices has slowed. Resale home turnover is still high, but it is taking longer to sell a dwelling compared with the same time last year.  BIS Review 100/2007 5 
Financial market innovations have also contributed to strong lending growth. In recent years loan products have been introduced that facilitate mortgage equity withdrawal – credit lines secured on dwellings. These loans are normally extended to borrowers with good collateral and debt-servicing capacity. They therefore present very little risk in a financial stability context. Credit lines secured on dwellings have rapidly increased in volume and now account for over 12 per cent of mortgages in banks and mortgage credit institutions. Foreign-owned banks were among the first to offer credit lines secured on dwellings and a far higher share of their mortgages are classified as this kind of loan. Other aspects of household behaviour in the housing market are increasing their vulnerability and giving greater cause for concern. First, the number of interest-only mortgages has risen. The possibility of interest-only periods is a buffer for households with debt-servicing problems. For many households, this buffer has already been used. Kredittilsynet’s 2006 mortgage survey, which includes loans secured on dwellings excluding credit lines, showed that around one in six mortgages in the survey had included an introductory interest-only period. This share was somewhat higher than in 2005. Another aspect that increases vulnerability is that a number of borrowers have a high loan to value ratio, particularly those below the age of 35. Household debt growth has been higher than income growth since 1999. The debt burden, defined as debt in relation to disposable income, has therefore increased markedly.  Households’ financial position is nonetheless sound. As measured here, housing wealth in Norway is almost four times higher than total household debt. Debt and wealth are, however, unevenly distributed. Combined with any marked turnaround in the housing market, this would create problems for exposed groups.  However, the financial situation of households as a whole is satisfactory. Unemployment is unusually low, but must be expected to increase somewhat in the medium term. Household disposable income is expected to show continued high growth ahead. Due to the long period of strong debt growth and sharply rising house prices, however, households’ financial position has become more vulnerable. Corporate sector Corporate profits have been very high in recent years. These positive developments have been broadly based and are mainly driven by favourable economic conditions in Norway and abroad. Enterprises have on average large financial buffers. Banks’ lending to the property industry accounts for approximately one third of their lending to the corporate sector. This sizeable exposure to one industry is a possible risk factor in relation to financial stability in Norway. Both property enterprises and their tenants are in a generally healthy financial position. Prices in the commercial property market have risen considerably in the past two years, and market participants are expecting the sharp rise to continue. Lower demand in the Norwegian economy may result in a slower rise than the market expects. Combined with higher interest rates, this may reduce profitability in the commercial property market, increasing banks’ losses. Losses on loans to the property industry accounted for a large share of banks’ loan losses during the banking crisis. Outlook for the banking industry Banks in Norway have experienced extremely favourable developments over the past few years: strong lending growth, minimal loan losses, high returns in securities markets and firm cost control. Despite lower interest margins, banks’ net interest income in NOK is rising as a result of strong lending growth. Measured in relation to total assets, however, net interest income is 6 BIS Review 100/2007 
falling. In recent years, this has been offset by a reduction in costs. Today’s high debt growth is not sustainable over time, and it is unlikely that the pressure on interest margins will abate. Given these developments, banks must reduce costs or increase income from other sources if they are to maintain their current profitability. To illustrate the effect of lower lending growth on banks’ income, we have carried out a simple calculation where the interest margin is held constant. If lending growth among banks had only been 3 per cent in 2006, banks’ net interest income and pre-tax results would both have been approximately 6 per cent lower this year. The composition of banks’ income has been fairly stable in the past ten years, even though net interest income has become less important since 2002. One reason for these developments is that net price gains on securities have increased in this period. Bearing in mind that this was a favourable period for securities markets, it will be difficult to maintain the income share from price gains in periods of more normal returns in securities markets.  With a slower rise in house and commercial property prices and lower lending growth, combined with a normalisation of loan losses, banks may find it more difficult to maintain the high level of profitability that we have witnessed in recent years. The new capital adequacy rules have had a strong impact on Norwegian banks and will continue to do so in the years ahead. How banks choose to utilise capital freed up as a result of the reduced minimum capital requirements, may have an impact on both competition and structure in the Norwegian banking sector. Freed-up capital may be used to finance lending growth, acquire other institutions or pay back capital to shareholders and other stakeholders. On average, Norwegian banks’ capital adequacy is solid. However, the substantial reduction in minimum capital requirements, even though there are transitional arrangements, also entails some risk that banks will reduce their capital to such an extent that the buffer needed to meet unforeseen events may become smaller than advisable. Banks’ profitability may also depend on the duration and severity of liquidity problems in international financial markets. Although Norwegian banks are probably somewhat less exposed than banks in many other countries, the impact may nonetheless be felt. It must also be expected that there will be strong focus on liquidity risk by financial institutions and supervisory authorities, and not least in the work on international regulations in the period ahead.

Stefan Ingves: Monetary policy, openness and financial markets Speech by Mr Stefan Ingves, Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, at Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, Stockholm, 24 September 2007. *      *      * "Say as little as possible and say it cryptically".1 This type of communication strategy is probably quite unthinkable for most central banks today. But this is how US professor of economics Alan Blinder describes central bank communications not so long ago. And I believe that this description is a pretty good one of how things actually worked, say 15 to 20 years ago. I would also guess that those of you here this evening who either monitored or worked in the financial sector at that time would agree with me. But since the beginning of the 1990s the Riksbank as well as most other central banks has taken considerable steps towards greater openness and clarity – both with regard to what we are trying to achieve and how we are going about it. Constantly working towards more efficient communication has been high on the Riksbank’s priorities list ever since the inflation target was introduced. But the pace of this work has varied as conditions for monetary policy and demands on the central bank have changed. So sometimes we have had fairly long periods without any major changes in our methods of communication, sometimes we have made many changes in a fairly short period of time. Particularly over the past two years we have made a number of changes and this has led to some debate. This often happens in times of change, particularly if it requires a learning process – for all those involved – before everything falls into place. And this is also the case with the changes in the Riksbank’s communication. It is therefore quite natural that some questions have arisen: Why has the Riksbank made these changes? Haven’t you made things unnecessarily complicated – tried to “fix something that isn’t broken”? Have you even gone too far in your openness? These are important questions that I shall try to answer here tonight. Giving the right information at the right time and in the right way is particularly important in times of unease. There has recently been unrest in the financial markets around the world. Sweden has not been affected by the market turbulence to the same extent as several other countries. I would nevertheless like to take the opportunity to say a few words about our views on what is happening right now and on the Riksbank's role in this context. But before I do so, I would first like to discuss the changes in our method of communication made over the past two years and the reasons behind them. What are the reasons behind the increased openness and clarity? Many consider that the Riksbank is currently one of the world’s most open central banks.2 And we have taken further steps in this direction over the past two years in particular. But what are the reasons behind this development towards greater openness? I think there are two reasons – democracy and efficiency. The first concerns our role as an independent authority. The second is linked to the fact that our communication with the financial markets and the general public is essential for monetary policy and the financial system to function efficiently.                                                  1  Page 38 in Blinder, A. S., (2006), “Monetary Policy Today: Sixteen Questions and About Twelve Answers”. I Fernandez de Lis, S. and F. Restoy (ed.), Central Banks in the 21st Century, Banco de España. 2  See, for instance, Eijffinger, S. and P. Geerats, (2006), “How Transparent are Central Banks?” European Journal of Political Economy, vol. 22, 1-21. BIS Review 106/2007 1 
Our independence requires openness The Riksdag and ultimately therefore the Swedish people have given the Riksbank considerable independence. But this is a “freedom with responsibility” that goes hand in hand with the requirements for insight and accountability. This is how things should be in a democracy. Openness is also something that traditionally imbues the Swedish public administration system in general. One of the corner-stones is the principle of public access, which means that the authorities’ activities should as far as possible be carried out in an open way. And this also applies to the Riksbank, of course. But openness is not only a requirement in itself but also a necessary condition for monetary policy to work. It does not work unless the Riksbank and the objective of our activities are supported and legitimated by the people. And this requires that we are open and clear. It should be easy to critically examine how monetary policy is conducted and how well we live up to our principles. Most people probably agree that the Riksbank’s openness has contributed to a good monetary policy debate in recent years. Openness and clarity contribute to monetary policy functioning better But it is not only democratic reasons that have led to the Riksbank and most other central banks becoming more open and clear. Another important reason is that we have quite simply regarded it as a means of more easily achieving our objective and of making monetary policy more efficient. There are three main aspects I would like to emphasise in this context: • Firstly, it will be easier to communicate that the interest rate decisions made are really aimed at achieving low and stable inflation. This provides greater credibility and helps to anchor expectations around the target. It was an important reason why the Riksbank began to publish its inflation forecasts and other material on which decisions are based early on in the new inflation-targeting system. I do not believe that it would have been possible to build up confidence in the price stability target as quickly as we did if we had not been as open as we were regarding our work and our decisions. • Secondly, openness and clarity are currently an important part of monetary policy in itself. You could say they are one of the tools in our toolbox. So what do I mean by this? There is a relationship between interest rates with different durations. And expectations of short-term interest rates, which the central bank governs, are important to the long-term interest rates. A central bank can therefore ”indirectly” influence interest rates with longer durations by influencing expectations of short-term interest rates. Greater influence over interest-setting throughout the economy – the yield curve – makes the impact of monetary policy more effective. This is often called conducting monetary policy with the aid of “management of expectations”. And the best way to do this is to provide good information. • The third and final aspect is that increased openness and clarity “outwards” can contribute to our working more efficiently within the Riksbank. This is a quite important argument. The more open we are, the easier it is for others to evaluate how well our monetary policy functions. This gives us an extra incentive to do a good job. What has the process towards openness and clarity resulted in? The path towards becoming more open and clear has not always been easy, it has at times caused some debate. Two issues in particular have been the subject of lively discussion over the past year. The first is that we now publish our own forecasts for the interest rate path. The second concerns how representatives of the Riksbank send signals regarding the interest rate in speeches and press releases. 2 BIS Review 106/2007 
Interest rate path a natural step towards openness In February 2007 we presented for the first time our own forecast for the development of the repo rate. Prior to this only the central banks in Norway and New Zealand published their own interest rate paths. But this group has now grown, with the addition of the Riksbank and in March this year also the Icelandic central bank. At the beginning of this month we also decided to publish our forecast for the path of the policy rate – and a number of other important variables – in connection with each monetary policy meeting. This means that we will publish our interest rate forecast six times a year, instead of three as before. By publishing our own forecast for the interest rate we have become more open and clear with regard to our view of future monetary policy. Along the way we have used three different assumptions for the policy rate – that it will remain unchanged, that it will develop according to market expectations, and, accordingly, that it will develop in the way we ourselves find most likely. Reasons why we want to present our own interest rate path Making its own forecast for the policy rate provides the central bank with a better tool for influencing expectations among households, companies and agents in the financial markets. In the cases where our view differs from the market view, we no longer need to take the rather circumstantial route via qualitative assessments of market pricing. Additionally, it becomes easier for us to show not only what we are thinking but also how we are thinking – it will be simpler to communicate how we view the driving forces behind economic developments and what monetary policy can achieve. If we succeed in communicating our view of how we think, then it will be easier for others to make good assessments on a continuous basis of how new information should affect the future development of the interest rate. This should reduce the fluctuations in the interest rate that are due to speculations regarding the Riksbank’s intentions. One aspect that may not have been given so much attention is that it has become simpler for households planning their private economy to form an impression of what the Executive Board considers to be a suitable development for the interest rate in the future. Previously, many probably had to refer to the interpretations made by financial advisers. But now the information is available in our Monetary Policy Report. Although the forecast for the interest rate will of course be regularly revised, it should reduce the uncertainty over how we ourselves view future developments. I believe this will be positive for everyone. The objections are not convincing But of course there are also some potential problems when a central bank presents its own forecast of the interest rate path. One is that the decisions in many central banks are currently made by a group of persons. How can a group of decision-makers agree on a forecast for the policy rate? The Riksbank’s experiences so far show that this need not be a problem. Nor does the Norwegian central bank, where decisions are made by an Executive Board consisting of seven persons, appear to have any major difficulties in agreeing on an interest rate forecast. Other arguments have also been raised against an own interest rate path. One such argument is that it could impair our credibility and instead make it more difficult for us to communicate with the general public and the financial markets. Let us assume that the Riksbank first publishes a particular interest rate path. Would our credibility be impaired if new information leads to our making another decision regarding the policy rate than we have previously announced? I don’t think so. I believe that there is a broad understanding among households, companies and market agents that we need to adapt monetary policy and reconsider how we should set BIS Review 106/2007 3 
the repo rate in future when new information changes the economic picture. We have been clear about the fact that a forecast is by definition uncertain and that it becomes more so the further ahead it stretches. And the interest rate path presented in the Monetary Policy Report is indeed a forecast. It is not a promise! The fact that we do not have perfect knowledge of the future is no reason to refrain from being as open and clear as possible with regard to what we believe will happen. We must form an opinion of how the policy rate should develop in the future regardless of whether we publish it or not. If it turns out that we have made an incorrect assessment in our forecast, it would not have been less incorrect just because we had refrained from telling anyone about it. It is hardly reasonable that we should try to gain greater credibility by hiding things or sending unclear signals about one of the most important variables in our analysis. I believe it is better that we are open about what our decisions are based on, now that the inflation target is so well-established that we are able to be open. Another objection to central banks publishing their own interest rate forecasts is connected to the functioning of the market. This means that in principle the financial market agents could stop looking for other information if they have access to the central bank’s forecasts for interest rates in the slightly longer term. How the market views economic prospects is normally reflected in the long-term market rates. This source of information could thus be lost and this would impair the functioning of the market. But as I perceive it, there have not been any such signs so far. In addition, I find it very difficult to imagine that the market agents would stop making independent assessments because we are publishing our own view of interest rate developments. They if anyone know that the interest rate path is a forecast and they therefore have strong reasons for continuing to search for information via other channels than the Riksbank. So far it has been clear that we and other market agents have actually had slightly different views regarding how the interest rate will develop in the future. And this is actually a sign that things are as they should be. It is quite natural that forecasters make different judgements, particularly in the slightly longer term. In the long term, there are also more factors than expected monetary policy that have significance for interest rates. We have so far only presented two forecasts for the policy rate, and as I mentioned earlier, there is a fairly large measure of ”learning by doing” for all those involved before everything falls into place. Everything does not always work perfectly from the start. But as I said, the purpose is that our communication will become clear and more efficient. And I am fairly convinced that we will get there, once the new system has been established. Clarity in the way we express ourselves in speeches and press releases The Riksbank has also changed its method of signalling monetary policy in speeches and press releases. In a broad sense, signalling means that we communicate in some way what we are intending to do with the repo rate. A narrower – and perhaps more common – interpretation of signalling is that it is when representatives of the Riksbank describe in speeches and press releases how they consider the interest rate should be set at the next meeting, and perhaps slightly further ahead. Previously, the Riksbank signalled ”by degrees”. Between the monetary policy meetings the individual Executive Board members held speeches on the theme of "the current situation” or something similar. There we indicated, more or less explicitly, how we thought the interest rate should be set. When it was time for the monetary policy meeting, sufficient information was assumed to have been released “by degrees” with regard to how the Executive Board as a whole were reasoning so that the economic agents would not be surprised by the interest rate decision taken at the meeting. But with the broader definition of signalling – when we in some way communicate what we are intending to do with the repo rate – the publication of our own repo rate forecast of 4 BIS Review 106/2007 
course also becomes part of the signalling. At intervals of two months, the general public and the financial markets now receive a detailed description of how a majority of the Executive Board consider that the interest rate should be set in the future. It is thus evident that the need for “signalling by degrees” in speeches between the monetary policy meetings has declined significantly. It was also the most important reason why we earlier this year decided that there would not normally be reason to indicate in speeches and press releases how the repo rate would be set at the next meeting. But there were also some problems with the earlier signalling that lay behind the decision. In certain situations it was probably difficult to determine whether the signal being sent in a speech should be interpreted as an individual member’s opinion or whether it reflected the views of a majority on the Executive Board. If the individual members sent out different signals it was probably also difficult to distinguish a clear message from this "cacophony of voices", to quote Professor Blinder again. This type of problem seems rather unnecessary. A central bank should be able to be so clear with regard to its view of the future that there should be no need for loosely-grounded speculations and interpretations – it should not be necessary to be a Kremlinologist to interpret the Riksbank. We hope that we have solved this problem with our new way of working. A further weakness of the earlier signalling process concerned the responsibility the Riksbank has in its role as independent authority. It is a question of democracy. This responsibility includes, for instance, the fact that the general public must have good insight into the decision-making process – the decisions at the monetary policy meetings must be made in a correct manner. This is why minutes are taken at the monetary policy meetings and then published, and the chairman and deputy chairman of the General Council of the Riksbank have the right to attend the Executive Board meeting. There must be no doubt that the interest rate decisions are actually made at the monetary policy meetings and not at some other point in time – in some informal way that prevents insight. If the signalling prior to the meetings leads people to believe that the interest rate decisions have been made in advance of the meetings, then doubts may arise. A concluding reflection on the Riksbank’s communication Let me, before I go on to discuss the recent developments in the financial markets, conclude my discussion of the Riksbank’s communication with a reflection. The fundamental purpose of the changes we have made in our communication is that we shall become even more open and clear with regard to what we do and how we think. But at the same time the changes – particularly our own interest rate path – mean that we have stuck our necks out and opened ourselves up to criticism in a different way than before. We no longer describe our policy in the form of a simple – albeit perhaps slightly misleading – policy rule, but show a more composite picture; the way it looks to us when we make our decisions. The publication of our own interest rate path also means that it has become clearer than before when we reconsider our views of what policy will be appropriate in the future and when our views differ from those of the market. It is therefore perhaps not so surprising that some debate has arisen. But to refrain from making changes that we consider to be necessary because we run the risk of being criticised is not a good strategy. I am convinced that the best method of conducting monetary policy in the long term is to describe as openly and honestly as possible how we are acting and reasoning. This is definitely something the general public can require of us in our role as an independent authority. So, to refer back to the questions I asked at the beginning. No, I do not think we have made things unnecessarily complicated or tried to fix things that are not broken. We have made changes we consider to be necessary both to improve the base for making monetary policy BIS Review 106/2007 5 
decisions and to provide as true and honest a picture of how monetary policy is conducted as possible. What has happened on the financial markets? In principle, communication is always important to a central bank and is a corner-stone in most parts of our activities. When the world around us is marked by uncertainty and unrest, the question of communication becomes even more important. There has recently been considerable unrest in the financial markets. But the Riksbank has nevertheless seen no need to specifically go out in public and comment on these developments. Sweden has not been affected to the same extent as many other countries and the Swedish interbank market and the financial system have functioned comparatively well. But let me nevertheless say a few words about what has happened and about the role the Riksbank plays in this context. General uncertainty has increased the need for liquidity abroad… Over the summer we saw signs of problems in the US housing market. The unrest increased when it was revealed at the beginning of August that several financial institutions had made significant losses in connection with the US sub-prime market. The background to this was that the number of households experiencing difficulties in paying their mortgages had gradually increased. It was also difficult to assess to what extent the different market agents were exposed to the assets concerned – in which balance sheets the credit risks had ended up. This was the starting point for a more general reassessment of risk in the financial markets. To make a long story short, one can say that the general uncertainty led to an increasing demand for safe assets such as treasuries. Government bond rates have fallen, while rates on some other investments have been pushed up. This is probably because risk premiums have increased, after being very low for a long period of time. For instance, interest rates on loans and deposits between banks, interbank rates, have risen in many countries. For instance, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Federal Reserve have seen a need to supply extra liquidity to slow down the rise in interbank rates. In the United Kingdom, the Bank of England has chosen to use its position as lender of last resort and to grant emergency liquidity assistance to a mortgage institution, Northern Rock. Emergency liquidity assistance is only given if the institution in question is assessed to be solvent but lacking sufficient liquid funds. …and here at home Sweden has also been affected by the turbulence in the financial markets, albeit to a much lesser extent than, for instance, the United Kingdom, Germany and the United States. The fact that Sweden has been affected despite not being, as it were, involved in the problems that started the unrest is not so remarkable. We are a part of the global financial system and not an isolated northern outpost. The Riksbank governs the short-term rate that applies for one day, the so-called overnight rate, and this has remained stable around the repo rate. In brief, the Riksbank’s method of steering interest rates has worked well. But the interbank rates with slightly longer durations have risen, although not as much as in some parts of the world. This is primarily a question of different effects from the uncertainty in the financial markets, such as rising risk premiums. On the whole, the Swedish financial system and the interbank market have nevertheless functioned well. 6 BIS Review 106/2007 
What is the role of the Riksbank? What does the Riksbank do when there is unrest in the money market? One of the most important tasks is to continue to ensure that the economy develops in a stable manner. We have to conduct our monetary policy so that we attain the inflation target of 2 per cent. Where possible, when the price stability objective allows scope for this, we should also ensure that production and employment develop in a balanced manner. This involves closely monitoring developments and following how the forecasts for growth and inflation develop. At our most recent monetary policy meeting we made the assessment that the financial unrest could slow down growth and inflation somewhat in the future and that the uncertainty had increased. At the same time, economic growth is strong both in Sweden and abroad. To attain the inflation target of 2 per cent and ensure a good development in the economy in the future, we decided to raise the repo rate. We also made the assessment that the interest rate would need to be increased further in around the same way as outlined in June. But the continuing developments in the financial markets are one factor among many that we will take into consideration in our decisions. If monetary policy is to function, interest rate-setting must also function. As I mentioned, we can only steer the shortest interest rate in the market. We do this by setting the repo rate and by daily adjusting the liquidity in the bank system at an interest rate that is very close to the repo rate. The banks can also receive as much liquidity as they need during the day against collateral. In addition, they can also deposit or borrow against collateral overnight with the Riksbank at the deposit or lending rate respectively. If we were to see serious and lasting problems, we have the possibility to take action. How we act depends on what has happened and on the situation at the time. And if we take action, we will clearly describe what we are doing and why. The Riksbank has close contacts with the Swedish banks and with other financial market agents. Although we do not see any indications of extensive liquidity problems at present, we will continue, as always, to closely follow developments in the financial markets. This is where our responsibility for financial stability also comes in. We have to ensure that the payment system functions in a safe and efficient manner. Part of this work involves regularly analysing developments in the financial market and the financial system’s capacity to withstand any shocks that might arise. We present our analyses regularly; most recently in May this year. We are also involved in shaping the regulatory framework to ensure it is designed to achieve a stable system. In all of our work regarding financial stability we work in close cooperation with other Swedish and international authorities. If the situation were to go so far that more serious liquidity problems nevertheless arose, we have detailed plans for how we can deal with them. If the worst came to the worst, we have the possibility to grant emergency liquidity assistance to the financial institutions under the supervision of Finansinspektionen (the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority). But we only do so if the institution in question is solvent. Loans are then granted at an interest rate that is higher than the lending rates in our steering interest rate system and only if we see that the Swedish financial system is threatened. Swedish banks must not take this possibility for granted and thus take unnecessary risks. Here there is a link to our ambition to be open and clear. An open attitude sets limits and shows the game rules. We have clearly described how we view our role as “lender of last resort”, for instance, in our Financial Stability Report.3 By being open about how we manage emergency liquidity assistance we reduce the risk that a situation may unnecessarily arise                                                  3  Financial Stability Report 2003:2 BIS Review 106/2007 7 
where we are forced to provide assistance. It also reduces the risk that we will be forced to provide support when this is not appropriate. Giving the right information at the right time and in the right way is important. It is particularly important in times when uncertainty is increasing. I hope that I have managed to communicate today not only the principles that have guided us with regard to our external communication in recent years, but also our picture of the recent situation. I also hope that I have succeeded in communicating that our ambition is to clearly report what we do and why. Thank you! 8 BIS Review 106/2007 
Ardian Fullani: Issues related to the Bank of Albania’s activities Speech by Mr Ardian Fullani, Governor of the Bank of Albania, at a regional meeting, Saranda, 24 September 2007. *      *      * Honourable participants, It is my special pleasure to come back to your wonderful city. Today’s meeting is held in the framework of the new communication strategy of the Bank of Albania with various groups of interest. Meetings in different regions of Albania help us better understand the specifics characterising certain geographic areas, raising the premises for an ever more harmonic and complete development at the country’s level.  I would like to elaborate with you some issues related to the Bank of Albania’s activity, which I think, from the viewpoint of coverage and effects, involve all the groups of interest participating in this meeting.  First I would like to deal briefly with the issue of communication. Nowadays it is widely accepted that chances for long-term success become a reality if one is capable of communicating in proper language, with proper actors and on due time. More concretely, the central bank should constantly communicate simply and transparently with all market stakeholders, including the broad public, in order to be efficient and forward-looking. This is a necessary premise to guarantee institutional credibility, real independence and a sound accountability.  For a long time from now the Bank of Albania has started to think in a forward-looking way about this process and I may actually declare that we have already started to obtain the first fruits. According to different estimates, we deem that market efficiency is increasing, inflation expectations are anchored around our target, while the awareness of financial stability has been constantly increasing.  Notwithstanding the above, our claims in terms of information and clarification of Bank of Albania’s decision-making are greater.  Proper language translation and understanding of the strategic and operational decisions (monetary policy decisions) is our strategic target. Our ambition in this regard is great and I would invite all the stakeholders in general and the banking system in particular to make more efforts for cooperation.  The Bank of Albania is confident that the financial market in Albania has already created a complete physiognomy. The participation of many foreign institutions of international reputation is a testimony in this regard. Recently its efficiency is enhanced, reflected in both, the traded volume and the reduced interest rate volatility. However, the Bank of Albania has noticed that the market should develop better and faster. Presently, I am of the opinion that there are no objective reasons that would weaken the financial market efficiency and in consequence the transmission of monetary policy to the economy.  The banking system has got all the possibilities and should interpret more correctly all the signals of the Bank of Albania, on due time and intensity. Also, the banking system should be seriously prepared not only with the respective structures, but also with professional human resources. This is a standard requirement, a postulate of modern times, to which we all should be committed at maximum.  I would let you know that the Bank of Albania has already prepared and soon enough will launch a specific package, centred on the efficiency of the financial market, particularly of the banking one. A new law on repurchase agreements, regulatory changes in required reserve BIS Review 106/2007 1 
maintaining and calculation, rarefaction of Treasury bill auctions from the viewpoint of time, and presentation of the base rate are part of this package.  All these measures will be implemented as a sole package and will revolutionize the inter-bank market operation, a vital link of the financial market for monetary policy transmission to the economy. On the other hand, they would make the operational tactics of the Bank of Albania more efficient. I invite the banking system to become part of this process, actively participating in all consultations of the case that will precede the launching of this package. Its suggestions and comments are welcomed at any moment.  Monetary policy decision-making of the Bank of Albania is the second issue I would like to deal with. I would like to repeat once more that consumer price stability is the primary target of the institution I govern. Recently, I believe you have had the occasion to comprehend from the statement of the Bank of Albania Supervisory Council that the risk for an inflationary environment is present. Also, we have enlisted in our statements the probable factors, which according to our considerations make the concern real for inflationary pressures to the economy.  The data disclosed by INSTAT show that the annual inflation in August 2007 recorded 4.2 percent, somewhat above the upper limit of the targeted band of 2-4 percent. August recorded a high monthly rate, 2.1 percent, a wholly unusual figure compared to the preceding years.  I am confident that we have been understandable when evidencing in our analyses that the causes relate to unforeseeable factors (unforeseeable shocks) and other reasons that have to do with the demand of the economy for goods and services. It should be underlined that during the current year the factors of first nature are numerous and relate to developments within the country and to “imported” developments from international economy. To be more concise, I would briefly highlight: 1. The energy crisis, which during this year appeared earlier than usual and according to different assessments, will continue beyond what the business may envisage in its plans at the beginning of each calendar year. Naturally, the effect of the lack of energy is very complex; it affects directly the productive capacities, creates additional cost (alternative source of energy) on final products, and increases the overall uncertainty. I think that these elements are sufficient to create ambiguity in the markets, generating inflationary premises in the economy. 2. During this year we have been faced with another problem. It has to do with an international conjuncture of raised prices, which exerts its impact on our market of goods and services. Fuels and cereals are more vulnerable by this conjuncture. The needs of our economy for these two articles are increasing, while the domestic resources are limited, making Albania dependant on imports, and in consequence on international market prices.  3. In general, the economy demand is estimated to have been high at end of 2006 and in the major part of 2007. This fact is evidenced in the large credit growth to the economy, in further enlargement of the current account, in increased imports of such goods as vehicles, household electrical appliances, and machinery and equipment. Generally, the increased demand at a certain period of time means inflationary pressures on the economy; therefore we have reasons to be seriously concerned about this problem.  4. Nowadays, public expectations for future inflationary developments are in the focus of the efforts of each central bank to ensure long-term price stability. More concretely, it has to do with the perceptions that every economic agent creates about future inflation. In some cases, these expectations are mostly based also on the facts verified in the past. But, successful is that central bank, which succeeds in anchoring these public expectations with a numeric target that it considers as the 2 BIS Review 106/2007 
optimal rate of inflation. Therefore, we are much focused in this direction, and I would like to once more emphasise in this meeting the Bank of Albania’s attitude, that we remain determined in our efforts to keep inflationary expectations anchored around 3 percent, a figure that constitutes also our numeric target.  To this end, we will continue to orient our political and operational decision-making towards the meeting of this target”.  As a final issue I would like to consider another major objective of the Bank of Albania, the one related to financial stability. As you may already know the Bank of Albania is the licensing and supervisory authority of the banking system and of some other segments of the financial system (non-banking financial institutions and foreign exchange bureaus). Being simultaneously even an important decision-making authority in the area of the financial and economic policies, it is understandable that a delicate challenge remains the harmonisation between both major priorities: effective monetary policy without damaging the financial stability and financial stability without damaging the monetary policy effectiveness.  Currently this is the trendiest issue. Many experts, decision-makers, academics are laying great emphasis on this problem and they rank the financial stability as a principal, which if shaken it takes upon itself the entire infrastructure from which it arose, from which it was nourished and grown. Therefore, I consider it important to come back and back to this issue.  Due to our not very distant history, I think that prudence in terms of financial stability is never excessive. I would like to assure you that the Albanian banking system is in a sound financial position, capitalised and profitable. Consolidation of the banking system through mergers and acquisitions, aiming at attracting internationally well-known investor with non-contestable experience in banking business is the prevailing philosophy in this regard. I believe that we have been successful in this direction. Recently there have been new entries in the system, highlighting internationally well-known banks, such as Intesa-San Paolo, Credit Agricol and Banka Societe Generale. As a conclusion, we may state that at present the Albanian banking system composition is appropriate, guaranteeing perspective support to the economy.  The entry of new banks has directly impacted on raising the value of the banking business in Albania, reflected, inter alia, in the increased competition among banks and aggressiveness of the banking system towards market share. The Bank of Albania deems that a reflection of this phenomenon is also the rapid growth of credit to the economy. More concretely, credit outstanding grew by 8 percentage points of GDP over three last years. In July `07 its annual growth was above 50 percent, which makes us believe that it may account for 28 % of gross domestic product at year end.  The Bank of Albania, in all its pronouncements, has argued that this phenomenon is a natural process that associates the banking business in every country. Also Albania, as most countries of the region, is under the rapid convergence process to certain parameters of the European Union.  To this end, we are completely aware of the fact that the growth rates will continue to be high. Leaving aside the probable effects on aggregate demand of the economy, I think that under the conditions of such rapid growth, the real challenge stands to the credit portfolio quality.  The Bank of Albania remains determined for the observance of the whole regulatory and supervisory package, which aims at guaranteeing a safe credit portfolio. We can not agree on some concepts crystallised recently, which make us understand that certain banks are running after the market share to the detriment of professional and rigorous treatment of applications for a loan.  Under the conditions when many objective obstacles exist, we deem that maximum prudence should be shown in extending loans. Let me remind you of the fact that we still inherit deficiencies in terms of ownership titles, collateral and its execution, address identification, property register and credit register. Non-recognition and non-acceptance of BIS Review 106/2007 3 
the above deficiencies increases the likelihood that objectively or subjectively, decision-making for extending a loan may be wrong. I do not feel well when I see that in certain considerable cases, decision-making takes place within a short period of time, not sufficient enough to verify the case associating the credit practice.  I avail myself of this opportunity to require from the banking system to observe rigorously the banking supervision and risk management regulations. Given the current structures of credit stock to the economy, I consider it important to advise banks to seriously assess their exposure to foreign exchange risk and be prudent for its management.  Finally, I would draw the banking system attention also to another problem, which I have raised times ago. I have observed that there is greater prudence in terms of governance and internal audit, but there are problems in terms of transparency, window services, commission policies and recent innovations with electronic transactions.  Our support will not lack in this direction. You may consider the Bank of Albania as a possibility of permanent consultation and assistance. I would assure you that we are totally concentrated on and willing to support and assist any banking institution that aspires to bring innovation, Western practices and standards to Albania.  In conclusion, let me to say a few words about the city we are gathered today, about the potential and support the banking system will provide to it.  Today Saranda is one of the most culminant places and may be the best show-case of possibilities and quality of the Albanian tourism, of this important sector that presently contributes by 9 % to the country’s gross domestic product.  Currently the figure of 1 million tourists a year has become a reality and its perspective goes even beyond, if we continue to pay necessary economic, social and institutional attention to tourism. Beyond such impressive figures, the tourism development is translated also into a constant improvement of Albania’s image as a country under progress, of values it possesses and provides, of increased level of employment and revenues for many areas and strata of population, as provision of values of many environmental, historical and cultural, geographic and curative, economic and social potentials, etc. Notwithstanding this optimistic situation, we should not forget that Albania is a Mediterranean country, found in one of the most developed tourism areas of the world, in one of the areas of the largest variety of types of tourism, and therefore in one of the areas where competition in tourism service is in its peak, where many of the countries of the region, with a very long tradition in this sector, have turned it into a real tourism industry.  Our objectives to improve rapidly and to solve qualitatively the problems of road infrastructure, water and electricity supply , sewerages, etc., should be attached to improved quality of services and implementation of standards, completion of regulatory and urban plans for all tourism areas, variety of types of tourism and tourism products. Besides the coastline tourism, which is dominant, the mountainous and rural tourism, cultural and historical tourism, archaeological and nature tourism, curative and sports tourism, massive and elite tourism should be also developed. All these are going to make the sector and the activity directly or indirectly related to tourism absorb more investments and loans, making banks, domestic and foreign businesses, private and institutional investors, etc., more interested and guaranteed for success.  You should be convinced that the banking business is observing you attentively, expecting a signal, a sparkle which is mostly at your hand. The standards are indispensable and should be respected. Therefore, I would invite the local government, the business community, the individuals of Saranda to be oriented towards the future, towards tourism and urban development models, similar to those of advanced countries.  Let me conclude by thanking you once more for your hospitality. 4 BIS Review 106/2007 
Ric Battellino: Some observations on financial trends Address by Mr Ric Battellino, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to Finsia-Melbourne Centre for Financial Studies, 12th Banking and Finance Conference, Melbourne, 25 September 2007. *      *      * The topic I would like to talk about today is credit provided by intermediaries, or what is broadly its mirror image, the debt of the household and business sectors. In many countries – including most of the English-speaking ones – credit has been rising strongly relative to GDP for many years now. This has been an ongoing topic of discussion among the world’s central banks and financial commentators, as people try to understand whether this trend is sustainable, what it means for the performance of economies and what it means for financial stability. I would like to touch on some of these issues today, particularly as they relate to Australia. Some facts Let me start with a few facts. This first graph shows two statistics for a range of developed economies: - the orange bars are the annual average growth in credit over the past 30 years; and - the purple bars are the annual average growth in nominal GDP over the same period. In each of the 15 countries shown, credit has grown substantially faster than GDP over the past 30 years.  BIS Review 106/2007 1 
Graph 1   The gap between the growth of credit and that of GDP has been particularly large in countries such as Ireland, Spain, Australia, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and the Netherlands. Across these six countries, credit has grown on average about 5 percentage points a year faster than nominal GDP over the period covered by this graph. It is a matter of arithmetic that if credit is growing faster than GDP, then the ratio of credit outstanding to GDP will rise. Across the 15 countries shown in Graph 1, the (unweighted) average ratio of credit to GDP has risen from about 60 per cent in 1977 to around 135 per cent today (Graph 2).  2 BIS Review 106/2007 
Graph 2     The extent of the upward trend in this ratio, and its persistence over such an extended period, is unusual from an historical perspective, if not unprecedented. For Australia, we have data on credit going back 150 years and it is certainly the case that there is no domestic precedent for what has happened over the past 30 years (Graph 3).1 The closest previous experiences were those in the 1880s and 1920s. In the former case, credit started to expand much more quickly than GDP in the early 1880s, but this trend lasted for less than 15 years, after which it reversed sharply. The surge in credit in the second half of the 1920s was less pronounced and shorter; it reversed after about five years.                                                   1  Before 1953, the series shown in the graph relates only to the credit provided by banks; after that it includes credit provided by all intermediaries. BIS Review 106/2007 3 
Graph 3     One of the clues as to why the recent episode of credit expansion has lasted longer is that it has been driven to an important extent by household borrowing rather than business borrowing.  We have estimates of household and business credit, of varying quality, going back to the 1920s. Before that, it is possible to get some guide to the split of borrowing between businesses and households by looking at which institutions were doing the lending. For example, credit extended by trading banks traditionally has mainly gone to businesses, while that extended by savings banks has mainly gone to households. The next couple of graphs decompose the series for total credit shown in Graph 3 into its business and household components. In the case of business credit, Graph 4 shows that the ratio of business credit to GDP exhibits big cyclical and secular swings, but these have taken place around a flat trend over the 150 years shown on the graph. Periods when the financial sector has been relatively unregulated, such as the 1880s and the past couple of decades, have resulted in the ratio of business credit to GDP being elevated. The subdued credit growth in the 1950s and 1960s, a period when the financial sector was heavily regulated, also is noticeable.  4 BIS Review 106/2007 
Graph 4     I don’t think these outcomes are surprising. In the very long run, however, there are various economic relationships at work that tend to tie down the relationship between business credit and GDP. Specifically, business profits cannot consistently rise faster or slower than GDP, and in the long run the P/E ratio also cycles around a flat trend. The combination of these two facts means that growth in the value of business equity must also be tied to GDP growth in the long run. In turn, this works to tie down the relationship between business debt and GDP, as the gearing of companies (i.e. the ratio of debt to equity) cannot consistently rise or fall. Let me now turn to household credit, as shown in Graph 5. Here the picture is very different. Up until the 1970s, households’ access to credit was very limited. Those of us over 50 years of age can remember when, in order to qualify for a housing loan, people had first to establish a long and consistent record of savings with a bank, and even then there was a tight limit on how much the bank would lend. Many borrowers had to resort to “cocktail” loans, at higher cost, to meet their needs.  BIS Review 106/2007 5 
Graph 5     Over the past 30 years, however, deregulation and financial innovation have greatly increased the household sector’s access to credit. This has been particularly so over the past 10-15 years as many banks focused their lending on the household sector after the credit losses on business loans in the early 1990s, and as financial innovations allowed non-bank lenders to enter the market for retail finance. The securitisation of loans, the development of numerous new loan products and the emergence of mortgage brokers were particularly important. Economic circumstances have also played an important role, just as they have for business credit. The decline in inflation and the resulting fall in interest rates have reduced the cost of debt, while the strong ongoing performance of the economy has made households more comfortable in taking on debt. These and other factors contributing to the growth of household credit were examined in more detail in a couple of papers presented by some of my colleagues at the Reserve Bank’s annual economic conference last month.2  In short, deregulation, innovation and lower inflation have simultaneously increased the supply, and reduced the cost, of finance to households, and not surprisingly households have responded by increasing their use of it. Household credit outstanding rose from 20 per cent of GDP in the 1970s to 30 per cent by 1990, and to around 100 per cent today. Household credit accounted for the bulk – 85 per cent – of the rise in overall credit to GDP over the past 15 years, and household credit now greatly exceeds business credit in terms of outstandings. While some of the rise in household credit has gone to financing consumption, most of it has been used to acquire assets. If we take the past 10 years, for example, households have borrowed in total an additional $770 billion over the period. Of this, 90 per cent was used directly to buy assets, the main components being $420 billion for houses to live in, $240 billion for houses to rent and $40 billion for shares.                                                  2  See Kent, C., C. Ossolinski and L. Willard (2007), “Household Indebtedness – Sustainability and Risk”, Reserve Bank of Australia Conference Paper, 20-21 August 2007; Ryan, C. and C.

The primary effects of this borrowing were therefore on asset values, the most noticeable being the more than doubling in house prices. While there was also some spill-over into consumer spending, the expansion of household credit by and large has been a story about asset markets. Similar developments have been experienced by many other developed economies over the past decade. Looking ahead Has the expansion of household credit run its course? Will it reverse? We cannot know the answer to these questions with any certainty, but my guess is that the democratisation of finance which has underpinned this rise in household debt probably has not yet run its course. In the past, the lack of access to credit had resulted in Australian household sector finances being very conservative. Even as recently as the 1960s, the overall gearing of the household sector (taking account of all household debt and all household assets) was only about 5 per cent – that is, households owned 95 per cent of their assets, including houses, outright. This meant that the household sector had significant untapped capacity to service debt and large unencumbered holdings of assets to use as collateral for borrowings. Financial institutions recognised this and found ways to allow households to utilise this capacity. The increase in debt in recent years has lifted the ratio of household debt to assets to 17½ per cent (Graph 6)3. I don’t think anybody knows what the sustainable level of gearing is for the household sector in aggregate, but given that there are still large sections of the household sector with no debt, it is likely to be higher than current levels. Graph 6     Cross-sectional data show that the rise in household debt has been driven primarily by middle-aged, and higher-income, households. Thus, while the build up of household debt is                                                  3  Measured on the same basis as corporate gearing (i.e. the ratio of debt to equity, rather than debt to assets) household gearing is marginally higher, at 21 per cent. BIS Review 106/2007 7 
often portrayed as being driven by young couples trying to buy their first home, a more accurate description is that it is mainly being driven by older, higher-income households that are trading up to higher quality or better located houses, buying investment properties and taking out margin loans to buy shares. These are all signs of rising affluence, driven by a very prolonged economic expansion. Over 80 per cent of households in the top half of the income distribution have some type of debt, compared with only 30 per cent of those in the lowest decile (Graph 7). Essentially, higher-income households are the ones that have the capacity and the financial security to take on debt. It seems that debt is one of those products, like education and health, which has a high income elasticity of demand – i.e. as income rises, demand for it rises more than proportionately. It would be a mistake, therefore, to conclude that a rising ratio of debt to income is necessarily a sign of financial stress among households.  Graph 7     It is the high-income groups that have had the biggest increase in debt over recent years (Graph 8 ). About three quarters of the increase in owner-occupier debt over the decade to 2005/06, for example, was attributable to households in the top half of the income distribution. If comparable figures on debt associated with investment properties and margin loans were available, they would almost certainly further skew this distribution of debt. 8 BIS Review 106/2007 
Graph 8     Despite the rise in the debt of this group of households, their debt servicing burdens remain relatively low. For those households who are in the top half of the income distribution and who have an owner-occupied housing loan, housing loan repayments currently average a little less than 20 per cent of gross income. This has risen only marginally over the past decade, and it remains significantly lower than the figure of around 30 per cent for households in the bottom half of the income distribution. This suggests that the former group still has substantial capacity to service debt. At the aggregate level across all households with owner-occupier housing debt, the median ratio of housing loan repayments to gross income, at about 21 per cent, is only marginally higher than a decade ago (Graph 9). Graph 9   BIS Review 106/2007 9 
Another interesting feature emerges when the composition of debt is broken down by age group. This shows that a large contribution to the increase in household indebtedness has come from households aged 45-65. This group no doubt overlaps considerably with the high-income household group. Over the 10 years to 2006, the proportion of households aged 45-64 that are carrying owner-occupier debt increased very noticeably, from 25 per cent to 38 per cent (Graph 10). This has been encouraged by increased life expectancy, and the financial security that comes from a strong economy with low unemployment and the build up of substantial holdings of assets through superannuation. Graph 10     The trend for households increasingly to carry debt into older age may not yet have come to an end. At present, the great bulk of households still pay off all their debts by age 65, but the factors that encouraged or allowed 45 to 64-year olds to increase their debt over the past 10 years may in due course change behaviour further up the age scale. Recent financial innovations, such as so-called “reverse mortgages”, which allow older people to access equity in their houses in order to fund retirement, could be one vehicle that encourages higher debt among older households. The pool of housing equity owned by older households is very large and drawings against this by even a small proportion of this group could add substantially to household debt levels. Some implications Let me end by drawing out some implications. The first is that we may not yet have seen the end of the rise in household debt. The rise to date has been overwhelmingly driven by those households that had the greatest capacity to service it – the middle-aged, high-income group. It is not surprising, therefore, that this rise in debt has exhausted neither the collateral nor the debt servicing capacity of this group, or the household sector overall. The factors that have facilitated the rise in debt over the past couple of decades – the stability in economic conditions and the continued flow of innovations coming from a competitive and dynamic financial system – remain in place. While ever this is the case, households are likely to continue to take advantage of unused capacity to increase debt. This is not to say that there won’t be cycles when credit grows slowly for a time, or even falls, but these cycles are likely to take place around a rising trend. Eventually, household debt will 10 BIS Review 106/2007 
reach a point where it is in some form of equilibrium relative to GDP or income, but the evidence suggests that this point is higher than current levels. It is interesting to consider what factors might change the behaviour of households. One such factor is demographics. It could be that the aging of the baby-boom generation will arrest the upward trend in household debt due to the effects of this group running down its assets and liabilities as it moves into old age. But whether this demographic effect is sufficient to offset the effects of other demographic shifts, such as the increase in longevity of the population in general, is not clear. A second factor is monetary policy. Central banks could stop the rising trend in household debt by raising interest rates to levels that exhausted households’ debt servicing capacity. But central banks around the world have generally concluded that the level of interest rates necessary to do this is higher than that needed to achieve monetary policy objectives in relation to inflation and economic growth, so this policy option has not been followed. The final point I would like to talk about is the implications of rising household debt for financial stability. There are two perspectives here.  The first is from the point of view of the lenders. Has the rise in household debt left lenders exposed to excessive risk? Any number of indicators – arrears rates on loans, exposure concentrations, capital ratios and profitability – suggest that the answer to this is “no”. This was also the conclusion reached in the Financial Sector Assessment Program conducted under the auspices of the IMF last year. As explained in the September 2006 issue of the Bank’s Financial Stability Review, even under the very extreme assumptions made in that stress test, banks remained profitable. The second perspective is from the point of view of household finances. As outlined in the Financial Stability Review published yesterday, overall household sector finances remain in good shape: average real income is rising, even after interest payments; financial net worth has increased noticeably; gearing levels are not out of line with international standards; and the proportion of households experiencing financial difficulties, though higher than a couple of years ago, remains historically very low. There are some pockets of stress, but the low numbers involved – less than 20,000 of the 5,300,000 housing loans in Australia are 90 days overdue on repayments – mean that this is not a macroeconomic problem, even though it is no doubt causing distress among those households and communities directly affected. At the macro level, there are two issues that arise from the developments in household finances over the past decade or two. The first is that the rise in household debt has made the household sector more sensitive to changes in interest rates. This has meant that central banks have been able to achieve their monetary policy objectives with smaller interest rate adjustments. Second, the household sector is running a highly mismatched balance sheet, with assets consisting mainly of property and equities, and liabilities comprised by debt. This balance sheet structure is very effective in generating wealth during good economic times, but households need to recognise that it leaves them exposed to economic or financial shocks that cause asset values to fall and/or interest rates to rise.

Jean-Claude Trichet: The process of European economic integration Speech by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, at the Fondation Jean Monnet pour l’Europe 2007, Lausanne, 21 September 2007. *      *      * 1. Introduction1  It is a great pleasure for me to be invited as a speaker to the Dialogue européen de la Fondation Jean Monnet pour l’Europe. Let me start by saying that we are today confronted with exciting challenges and unique historical developments. The enlargement of the European Union, currently including 27 countries and 494 million people with Romania and Bulgaria recently joining, is an exceptional endeavour. More historical developments can be observed in the euro area, which now comprises 13 countries and will expand to 15 in three months’ time as we are joined by Cyprus and Malta.  It is a fact that economic integration has increased among the countries in the European Union. It is also true that further and deeper integration is needed and that the creation of the euro area, as well as EU enlargement and globalisation, highlights the need for flexible economies. In this sense, all policy-makers and social partners now have increased responsibilities. They must provide good management to ensure a well-functioning European Union characterised by flexibility, integrated labour, product and financial markets and disciplined fiscal policies.  This leads me to the issue I would like to address today, namely the process of European economic integration. First, I would like to share with you some stylised facts on the features of the European Union’s and the euro area’s economic integration process. Second, I would like to look at some ideas regarding economic adjustment processes, particularly in the euro area. Finally, I would like to talk about Europe in a global context.  2.  Features of economic integration in the European Union Allow me to briefly elaborate on four main features of the process of economic integration in the European Union, and the euro area in particular.  i) First, economic integration has been reflected in a marked increase in intra-euro area trade in goods and services. Let me provide you with some figures. Exports and imports of goods within the euro area increased from about 26% of GDP in 1998, the year before the adoption of the single currency, to around 32% in 2006. Intra-euro area exports and imports of services increased from about 5% of GDP in 1998 to almost 7% in 2006. The continued deepening of the Single Market will further facilitate trade in services. As this interdependence within the euro area becomes stronger, the euro area is also becoming a more open economy with increasing extra-euro area trade. Extra-euro area exports and imports of goods rose from about 24% of GDP in 1998 to around 33% in 2006. Over the same period, extra-euro area exports and imports of services increased from about 8% of GDP to almost 10%. These developments clearly show that we are not witnessing the creation of a “fortress Europe”. On the contrary, European integration complements global integration.                                                   1  I should like to thank Malin Andersson for her input into this speech, Klaus Masuch and Hans-Joachim Klöckers for their helpful comments, and Philippe Leclercq, Katherine Brandt and Antonio Afonso for their additional contributions.

ii) As a second feature, the introduction of the euro has contributed to financial integration which, in turn, improves the free movement of capital in the euro area. Financial integration enhances the efficiency of economic mechanisms, strengthens competition and raises the potential for stronger economic growth. For example, recent research by London Economics estimated the benefits of the integration of EU bond and equity markets to be around 1 percentage point of additional GDP growth over a ten-year period, or approximately €100 billion.2 Financial integration is also crucial, as it enhances the smooth and effective transmission of the single monetary policy throughout the euro area. Despite some progress, further financial integration is particularly needed in a number of areas, including in retail banking. iii) Labour mobility constitutes the third feature I should like to mention. Lack of openness in some countries increases risks of wage pressures as labour markets tighten. Available evidence suggests that, overall, cross-border labour mobility is still limited in most parts of the European Union and we still have regulatory barriers across the European Union, including the euro area in respect of labour from Slovenia. This is in clear contrast to the situation in the United States.  iv) As a fourth and final feature, the degree of synchronisation or co-movement between the different cyclical positions across the euro area countries increased since the beginning of the 1990s. In other words, a large number of euro area economies now share similar business cycles. In addition, current inflation and output growth differences among euro area countries are relatively limited compared with the past. The differences are also similar to those observed across regions or states within the United States.  The decline in inflation differentials has been impressive. At the beginning of the 1990s, the dispersion in inflation rates across the euro area countries was, on average, around 6 percentage points (standard deviation measured in unweighted terms). Last year, the inflation dispersion was only 0.7 percentage point. As to real GDP growth rates across the euro area countries, the dispersion, measured in terms of standard deviations, has been fluctuating around a level of 2 percentage points over the past few decades, with no apparent upward or downward trend.  While some differences are temporary, others are of a more persistent nature. Let me stress that the sustained differences in economic growth or inflation rates between some euro area countries are absolutely normal in a monetary union, to the extent that they are related to catching-up phenomena. However, it is also true that persistent differentials which reflect structural rigidities are a concern. I will address this issue later. In sum, there is evidence of stronger economic integration among the countries in the European Union. The adoption of the euro has particularly contributed to this development by reducing information costs, enhancing price transparency and eliminating exchange rate risk between countries in the euro area. In this manner, the euro acted as a catalyst for the Single Market, within which goods, services, people and capital are to move freely. Nonetheless, a lot remains to be done, for instance, in order to increase services trade and labour mobility and to reduce structural rigidities. 3.  Economic integration and adjustment processes in the euro area Let me now turn to adjustment processes whose smooth functioning is important in all EU countries but particularly in the euro area. Why is an efficient adjustment mechanism particularly important in the euro area? In a monetary union where national monetary and                                                  2  London Economics, “Quantification of the macroeconomic impact of integration of EU financial markets”, report to the European Commission, 2002. 2 BIS Review 105/2007 
exchange rate policies are no longer available options, it is important to make sure that other mechanisms of adjustment to shocks function properly. This is needed to avoid a situation whereby a country or a region, for instance after experiencing a specific event or asymmetric shock, enters either into a period of protracted low growth and higher unemployment, or into a long period of overheating. There are many factors that can improve the resilience of the euro area economies to adverse shocks. But before addressing this issue, let me stress that the ECB’s single monetary policy contributes to the proper functioning of adjustment mechanisms within the euro area by ensuring price stability, i.e. by anchoring price stability in economic agents’ decisions. I believe that this is a very important contribution. In other words, the social partners, when agreeing on wage increases, and also national authorities, when preparing their budgets or designing policies in their fields of responsibility, should be, and, as a matter of fact, are fully confident that we, at the ECB and in the Eurosystem, will deliver price stability. Turning to other factors, well-designed structural reforms that enhance competition and foster flexibility in product and labour markets are particularly relevant for the proper functioning of the euro area.  In this context, the Lisbon strategy is a fundamental and ambitious programme to draw Europe’s attention to the urgency of structural reforms. Such reforms will improve long-term growth prospects. They do so by affecting positively labour participation and by improving productivity growth through the promotion of innovation and technological change. In recent years, we have already seen the benefits of a number of structural reforms, with the creation of about 13 million new jobs since 1999.  Economic flexibility can be promoted by removing the institutional barriers to flexible wage and price-setting mechanisms. Specifically, in a monetary union, most of the adjustment has to take place through national labour markets. Therefore, wage setting should appropriately reflect the different situations of sectors, of firms and of overall labour market conditions. Let me stress that social partners share responsibility for ensuring that wage settlements fully take into account the need to reduce unemployment and to enhance labour market access and employment. Moreover, governments should also be aware of the way in which wage setting for public servants can serve as a role model for the private sector. And social partners need to take into account the different conditions at the firm and sectoral level, internalising the repercussions of wage settlements on competitiveness and thus employment at their company and in their industry, sector or region. Sufficient wage differentiation would improve employment opportunities for less skilled workers and in regions or sectors with high unemployment. In this respect, it is clear that excessive wage regulations are undermining job creation, in particular for young and less qualified workers, as well as for all those who face problems entering the labour market.  The proper functioning of adjustment through labour markets also requires the completion of the Single Market. In particular, all existing barriers to labour mobility within the EU and notably within the euro area must be removed.  As to product markets, let me stress that it is also essential that the Single Market be deepened, particularly in services and network industries. Greater cross-border competition and a deeper integration of markets across all EU countries would contribute to lower prices and higher real wages. It would also enhance price flexibility, and thereby the adjustment processes in the individual countries. Another important market-based mechanism that can help to attenuate the impact of shocks in a country or region is well-integrated financial markets and readily available opportunities for the diversification of financial asset portfolios. This would reduce the dependence of households’ saving and spending decisions on economic and financial developments in their country or region. This mechanism is known as the “credit and risk-sharing channels”. In essence, it means that consumption is less dependent on movements in national output, first BIS Review 105/2007 3 
because consumers can borrow from international financial institutions which are active at the level of the euro area, and second because the financial wealth of households is less dependent on local conditions thanks to an internationally well diversified portfolio allocation. Moreover, more integrated financial markets give rise to greater competition, resulting in more favourable financing conditions for consumers and firms. To provide you with some figures, in the United States, over the period 1963-90, capital markets smoothed out 39% of the shocks to gross state product (the equivalent to GDP), the credit channel smoothed out 23% and the federal government, through the fiscal channel, 13%. Around 25% of the shocks were not smoothed out. Hence, financial markets and financial institutions contributed 62% to the absorption of idiosyncratic state shocks. We therefore see from the US example that the financial channel can be much more important than the fiscal channel. This is an additional reason for speeding up financial integration in Europe.3 According to a more recent study, the level of integration in the euro area has been increasing, although it remains modest. It was found that in the countries that now make up the euro area (excluding Luxembourg), capital markets smoothed out about 10% of the country-specific shocks to GDP between 1993 and 2000.4  National authorities can also make a substantial contribution to ensuring the proper functioning of adjustment mechanisms within the European Union by conducting well-designed fiscal policy. The best contribution fiscal policy can make to the proper functioning of the euro area is by being disciplined and medium-term oriented, fully in line with the orientations provided by the Stability and Growth Pact. Moreover, improving the quality of public finances can enhance business and growth conditions, while at the same time allowing a reduction in overall public spending at the national level. Indeed, available evidence points to the existence of significant inefficiencies in public spending both in the EU and in OECD countries. In other words, it would seem that public spending could be substantially reduced without a detrimental impact on the volume of output. Additionally, a more efficient public administration would also allow the indirect costs of public sector inefficiency, linked to financing through inappropriate taxation regimes, to be reduced.  Let me finally mention the important issue of competitiveness. One of the most important market-based adjustment mechanisms in a monetary union works via changes in competitiveness. In the euro area, persistent losses in relative cost competitiveness necessarily translate, in the medium term, into a period of below-average growth and an abnormal level of unemployment. According to recent figures, the difference in the cumulated growth of unit labour costs for the total economy between the euro area countries with the largest and the smallest cost increases, respectively, was between 20% and 25% in the period 1998-2006.  In sum, structural reforms in the labour, product and financial markets together with sound fiscal policies are crucial to enable smooth adjustment processes in the European Union and particularly in the euro area. At the same time, differences in price competitiveness and in unit labour costs across the euro area economies need to be closely monitored, as they may imply major adjustments in the countries concerned in the years ahead. 4.  Europe in a global context Economic integration and smooth adjustment processes are clear prerequisites for the efficient functioning of the European Union. All the more so because Europe is regularly                                                  3  See P. Asdrubali, B. Sorensen and O. Yosha, “Channels of interstate risk sharing: United States 1963-1990”, Quarterly Journal of Economics Vol. 111, 1996. 4  See S. Kalemli-Ozcan, B. Sorensen and O. Yosha, “Asymmetric shocks and risk sharing in a monetary union: Updated evidence and policy implications for Europe”, CEPR Discussion Paper No. 4463. 4 BIS Review 105/2007 
confronted with various adverse events or shocks, for instance in the context of globalisation, which translates in particular into greater interdependence between our economies through an increase in cross-border transactions of goods, labour and capital. Let me briefly elaborate on this aspect. Globalisation is triggering major transformations all over the world, not only in Europe. For instance, globalisation has undeniably had an impact on the inflation process.  Numerous channels have been identified in economic theory through which globalisation can influence the level of prices. Without doubt, globalisation and the associated rise in world trade have contributed to import price moderation,5 notably in the manufacturing sector, which is primarily due to increased imports from low-cost countries. Furthermore, the widespread opening-up of emerging countries and of almost all former centrally planned economies has significantly increased the labour pool available, leading to dampening pressures on labour costs, especially for unskilled labour. Globalisation can also exert pressure conducive to lower inflation more indirectly, as increasing international competition may have limited the pricing power of domestic corporations. However, at the same time, the sudden emergence of fast-growing economies in the global economy is exerting upward pressure on prices for energy and raw material prices.6  Regardless of the intensive research currently pursued in particular in academia, at central banks and at various international institutions, there still remains significant uncertainty about the aggregate role and impact of globalisation. Even though the net effect of these counterbalancing forces is mostly believed to have contributed towards reducing inflation, whether and how long this disinflationary effect will last in the future remains an open question. Ultimately, globalisation is an opportunity, not a threat. Globalisation provides much-needed solutions. For instance, it may allow increased labour inflows to the euro area, which, in certain sectors, would help to reduce bottlenecks in labour markets and hence ease wage pressures. In addition, globalisation may supply external capital in exchange of know-how. As a matter of fact, the euro area has become an attractive place for foreign direct investment (FDI). A breakdown of extra-euro area liabilities indeed reveals that inward FDI amounts to more than 27% of euro area GDP, against 22.5% for the United States. The euro area has received, proportionally to GDP, a similar amount of FDI as China, 27.3% for both economies, according to IMF statistics. A rising amount of FDI comes from the so-called BRIC group – including Brazil, Russia, India and China. In fact, contrary to what such protectionist thinking would suggest, EU integration and the adoption of the euro seem to make Europe fitter for globalisation. The single currency has supported the development and diversification of exports in the euro area countries, as mentioned earlier. The euro has also made a significant contribution to the process of opening up euro area financial markets. On the assets side, stocks of euro area assets held abroad have increased from less than 87% of GDP in 1999 to over 124% in 2005. On the liabilities side, the increase was also very substantial, from around 92% of GDP to 137%. The rise has actually been much less pronounced for the United States during the same period: US assets grew from 80% of GDP in 1999 to 90% today, and US liabilities increased from 91% to 110% of GDP. In other words, the euro area and the United States held roughly                                                  5  See Box 13 in the June 2007 issue of the Monthly Bulletin entitled “Is the downward impact of globalisation on import prices waning”. 6  Furthermore, there are also other factors – independent of globalisation – that can help to explain the decline in global inflation, such as the rapid technological progress and structural reforms that both have helped to increase the growth potential of the economies and thus to facilitate price stability, greater budgetary discipline and finally “better” monetary policy, that have resulted in an enhanced credibility of central banks. BIS Review 105/2007 5 
comparable assets and liabilities in 1999, but the euro area witnessed a more substantial increase since the start of Economic and Monetary Union. Finally, globalisation puts emphasis on the need for further reforms to raise the ability of Europe to adjust to the major changes taking place in the global environment. The implementation of such reforms should raise flexibility and lower the adjustment costs for European firms and workers facing the globalisation process. Raising competitiveness is the main condition for making globalisation a success for the European citizens. 5.  Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, let me conclude. The successful creation of the euro area and further economic integration within Europe has gone hand in hand with the integration of Europe within the global economy. In no way are we creating a “fortress Europe”. This is not our objective and is not in our interests. It is crucial to promote further economic integration and to enhance flexibility of the European economies. This would also enhance adjustment processes in Europe. As regards monetary policy, Europe can count on the European Central Bank and the Eurosystem to be faithful to their primary objective and solidly anchor inflation expectations in the euro area. As regards the elements of policy that do not depend on the central bank, I have touched on three crucial areas: disciplined fiscal policies, fully in line with the Stability and Growth Pact; structural reform policies, fully in line with the Lisbon Agenda and the completion of the Single Market; and appropriate monitoring of the relative cost competitiveness indicators. Thank you very much for your attention. 6 BIS Review 105/2007 
Zhou Xiaochuan: China’s financial market – innovation and development Speech by Mr Zhou Xiaochuan, Governor of the People’s Bank of China, at the National Association of Financial Market Institutional Investors (NAFMII) Inaugural Meeting, Beijing, 3 September 2007. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen,  Good morning! It is a pleasure to attend the inaugural meeting of the National Association of Financial Market Institutional Investors (NAFMII). NAFMII’s establishment is a major event in the development of China’s financial markets, and a concrete practice of implementing the spirit of the National Financial Work Conference. On behalf of the People’s Bank of China, I would like to warmly congratulate you.  In the year 1792, a group of twenty four traders gathered under a buttonwood tree at 68 Wall Street, signed the now famous Buttonwood Agreement, and agreed to follow the principles of fair trading in the Agreement. This agreement marked the beginning of industry self regulation in the U.S. financial sector. In the more than 200 years since then, various self-regulatory organizations have been established by participants of financial markets in countries throughout the world, and rules of self discipline formulated.  In China, after ten years of development, the inter-bank market has evolved into a multi-layered system with many sub-sectors including bonds, inter-bank borrowing, bills, gold and foreign exchange markets. In this system, major participants are qualified institutional investors and the trading is based on direct enquiries between two parities. The market is expanding steadily. Take the inter-bank bond market as an example. At end August 2007, the stock of bonds reached 10.48 trillion yuan, about 25 times of that at end 1997; participants numbered 7,137, about 446 times of that at end 1997. The range of market participants expanded from just commercial banks to all kinds of institutional investors, and products on the market have been diversified from government securities and policy financial bonds to a much larger collection including government securities, central bank bills, policy financial bonds, commercial bank financial bonds, enterprise bonds, short-term financing bills, asset-backed securities, bonds issued by international development institutions, U.S. Dollar-denominated bonds, and etc.  In China, the inter-bank market is a typical OTC market. In terms of international experience of OTC market development, various self-regulatory organizations (SROs) such as the National Association of Securities Dealers(NASD), the Japan Securities Dealers Association (JASD), the Korea Securities Dealers Association(KSDA) have all played a very important role in promoting innovation and development, regulating market behaviors, safeguarding the industry's interests, and forestalling market risks, and are an integral part of financial market regulation system in their respective country. Experience has shown that the SROs enable market participants to mobilize themselves to exercise self discipline, help the transformation of government functions, make the regulation more responsive to market demand, and promote market innovation and development in a market-based approach.  In recent years, a lot of achievements have been made in China’s financial market development. However, the financial sector has its problems. For example, the imbalance between direct and indirect financing remains serious as bank loans still dominate financing; the financial market development is lopsided as the bond market still lags behind securities market, and enterprise bond market remains under-developed; information disclosure, credit rating and other essential mechanisms have yet to play a sufficient role; the range of financial products are not diversified and market functions are yet to be fully played out. It is an imperative task to promote innovation and development in the financial market. For quite some time, we focused on liquidity management in the inter-bank money market, but did not BIS Review 105/2007 1 
fully acknowledge the financing, value discovery and risk management functions of the market. As a result, launching of financial products that are conducive to market development and urgently needed by market participants has been delayed. I hope that the Association will gather members’ wisdom and serve their need; and innovation of market participants will be given full play to develop innovation mechanisms and patterns based on the special features of OTC market.  In the future, the products that are developed based on members’ need, and are suitable for trading among institutional investors who have pricing and risk managing abilities will be registered at the NAFMII and reported for filing with the regulatory authority. Administrative exam and approval procedure will be abolished for such products.  As the agency that overseas the operation of NAFMII, the PBC has a lot of expectations on the newly established organization. I hope that the Association will provide good services to its members and to the government and the general public, exercise self regulation functions, and contribute to innovation, reform and development of financial markets in China through hard work and innovation.  Thank you. 2 BIS Review 105/2007 
Radovan Jelašić: Bringing Serbia closer to Europe Speech by Mr Radovan Jelašić, Governor of the National Bank of Serbia, on the Promotion of Commemorative Coins Issued to Mark the Bicentenary of Dositej Obradović’s Coming to Serbia, Belgrade, 17 September 2007. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen, 200 years ago Dositej Obradovic came to liberated Serbia and wholeheartedly put his knowledge in the service of the newly-fledged state and revival of the Serbian national being. By advocating the setting up of modern institutions and promoting literacy and the use of language understood by all, Dositej imbued Serbia with the spirit of 18th century enlightenment ideas, thereby making the first significant steps towards making Serbia and Europe closer. Even today his messages ring loud and clear, because Serbia is a part of Europe and is willing to accept and nurture European values. Serbian government declared the year 2007 the YEAR of DOSITEJ, while the National Bank of Serbia decided to mark the bicentenary of Dositej’s coming to Serbia by issuing gold and silver commemorative coins featuring his portrait. New series of coins consist of 500 finest gold coins in denomination of 5 000 dinars weighing 3,455 g each and 1 000 finest silver coins in denomination of 1 000 dinars weighing 13 g each. As of today, commemorative coins featuring the portrait of this great Serbian author, philosopher and linguist will be available for sale in the NBS Head Office in Belgrade and in NBS branches in Novi Sad, Kragujevac, Nis and Uzice. All those who acquire them will be able to read on their reverse Dositej’s ever topical message: "Learn and broaden your horizons throughout your life". This is exactly what the National Bank of Serbia is doing– building a modern central banking institution ready for the time when Serbia will join the European family. For us, this means at least three things: 1. Unwavering pursuit of the principal objective of the National Bank of Serbia as defined in the law – to achieve and maintain price stability.  2. Professional, responsible – or to put it in Dositej’s words – modern and “enlightening” monetary policy. This can be nothing but a monetary policy that ensures low inflation, as today there is not a single country in the region or Europe which has high rates of inflation.  3. Thirdly, an independent central bank. This most certainly does not mean that the National Bank of Serbia should not act in coordination with the Government. To the contrary, joint work on achieving and maintaining a low rate of inflation will yield the optimal result. But, central bank independence means that the NBS will not directly pursue objectives relating to social or quasi-developmental policies, employment, exports or regional development, or, even less, to electoral timing, but that it will implement a monetary policy that ensures price stability and thereby achieve all of the above listed objectives.  As many as two centuries ago, Dositej endeavoured to bring Serbia closer to Europe. Today, we have a duty to continue his efforts – a duty both to the past, but even more so to the future. Harmonization with European standards must not, however, serve as a disguise for “adjustment” to internal daily political needs, especially when it comes to such an important institution as the National Bank of Serbia.

Ben S Bernanke: Subprime mortgage lending and mitigating foreclosures Remarks by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, before the Committee on Financial Services, US House of Representatives, Washington DC, 20 September 2007. *      *      * Chairman Frank, Ranking Member Bachus, and members of the Committee, I am pleased to appear before you to discuss the origins of the problems in the subprime-mortgage market and the response of the Federal Reserve to these developments. I will also discuss some possible legislative options for addressing these concerns.  Recent developments in the subprime-mortgage sector Let me begin with some background on the subprime-mortgage sector. Subprime mortgages are loans intended for borrowers who are perceived to have high credit risk. Although these mortgages emerged on the financial landscape more than two decades ago, they did not begin to expand significantly until the mid-1990s. The expansion was fueled by innovations – including the development of credit scoring – that made it easier for lenders to assess and price risks. In addition, regulatory changes and the ongoing growth of the secondary mortgage market increased the ability of lenders, who once typically held mortgages on their books until the loans were repaid, to sell many mortgages to various intermediaries, or "securitizers." The securitizers in turn pooled large numbers of mortgages and sold the rights to the resulting cash flows to investors, often as components of structured securities. This "originate-to-distribute" model gave lenders (and, thus, mortgage borrowers) greater access to capital markets, lowered transaction costs, and allowed risk to be shared more widely. The resulting increase in the supply of mortgage credit likely contributed to the rise in the homeownership rate from 64 percent in 1994 to about 68 percent now – with minority households and households from lower-income census tracts recording some of the largest gains in percentage terms. However, for all its considerable benefits, the broadening of access to mortgage credit that has occurred during the past decade also had important negative aspects. Not surprisingly, given their weaker credit histories and financial conditions, subprime borrowers default on their loans more frequently than prime borrowers. The consequences of default may be severe for homeowners, who face the possibility of foreclosure, the loss of accumulated home equity, and reduced access to credit. In addition, clusters of foreclosures can lead to declines in the values of nearby properties and do great damage to neighborhoods.  During the past two years, serious delinquencies among subprime adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) have increased dramatically. (Subprime mortgages with fixed rates, on the other hand, have had a more stable performance.) The fraction of subprime ARMs past due ninety days or more or in foreclosure reached nearly 15 percent in July, roughly triple the low seen in mid-2005.1 For so-called near-prime loans in alt-A securitized pools (those made to borrowers who typically have higher credit scores than subprime borrowers but still pose more risk than prime borrowers), the serious delinquency rate has also risen, to 3 percent from 1 percent only a year ago. These patterns contrast sharply with those in the prime-mortgage sector, in which less than 1 percent of loans are seriously delinquent. Higher delinquencies have begun to show through to foreclosures. About 320,000 foreclosures were                                                  1  Estimates of delinquencies are based on data from First American LoanPerformance. BIS Review 104/2007 1 
initiated in each of the first two quarters of this year (just more than half of them on subprime mortgages), up from an average of about 225,000 during the past six years. Foreclosure starts tend to be high in states with stressed economic conditions and to rise where house prices have decelerated or fallen.  Adjustable-rate subprime mortgages originated in late 2005 and in 2006 have performed the worst, with some of them defaulting after only one or two payments (or even no payment at all). Relative to earlier vintages, more of these loans carried greater risks beyond weak borrower credit histories – including very high initial cumulative loan-to-value ratios and less documentation of borrower income. In addition, the sharp deceleration in home prices since 2005, including outright declines in some markets, left many of these more-recent borrowers with little or no home equity. In this situation, some borrowers (particularly owner-investors) may have found that simply walking away from their properties was their best option. Moreover, low home equity has made refinancing – the typical way for many subprime borrowers to avoid large scheduled interest rate resets – difficult or impossible for many. Thus, with house prices still soft and many borrowers of recent-vintage subprime ARMs still facing their first interest rate resets, delinquencies and foreclosure initiations in this class of mortgages are likely to rise further. It is difficult to be precise about the number of foreclosure initiations expected in coming quarters, as it will depend on (among other factors) the evolution of house prices, which will vary widely across localities. Historically, about half of homeowners who get a foreclosure notice are ultimately displaced from their homes, but that ratio may turn out to be higher in coming quarters because the proportion of subprime borrowers, who have weaker financial conditions than prime borrowers, is higher. The rise could be tempered somewhat by loan workouts.  The originate-to-distribute model seems to have contributed to the loosening of underwriting standards in 2005 and 2006. When an originator sells a mortgage and its servicing rights, depending on the terms of the sale, much or all of the risks are passed on to the loan purchaser. Thus, originators who sell loans may have less incentive to undertake careful underwriting than if they kept the loans. Moreover, for some originators, fees tied to loan volume made loan sales a higher priority than loan quality. This misalignment of incentives, together with strong investor demand for securities with high yields, contributed to the weakening of underwriting standards.  The fragmented market structure of mortgage originators in the subprime-lending industry may also have contributed. Data collected under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act show that independent mortgage companies – those that are not depository institutions or their subsidiaries or holding company affiliates – made nearly half of higher-priced first-lien mortgages in 2006 but only one-fourth of loans that were not higher-priced. In addition, some sources report that the majority of mortgages are obtained through a broker, often an independent entity, who takes loan applications on behalf of a depository institution or other lender. The various lending institutions and brokers operate under different regulatory and supervisory regimes with varying intensities of enforcement effort. That fragmentation makes monitoring brokers and lenders difficult for regulators and investors alike. Markets do tend to self-correct. In response to the serious financial losses incurred by investors, the market for subprime mortgages has adjusted sharply. Investors are demanding that originators employ tighter underwriting standards, and some large lenders are pulling back from the use of brokers. The reassessment and resulting increase in the attention to loan quality should help prevent a recurrence of the recent subprime problems. Nevertheless, many homeowners who took out mortgages in recent years are in financial distress. To help those borrowers, the Federal Reserve, together with the other federal supervisory agencies, has issued two statements – in April, to mortgage lenders; and earlier this month, to mortgage servicers – to encourage the financial industry to work with borrowers to arrange prudent loan modifications to avoid unnecessary foreclosures. The Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS) joined the federal agencies in the second statement. Often, loan workouts are in the interest of all parties. We have also encouraged 2 BIS Review 104/2007 
lenders and servicers to identify and contact borrowers who, with counseling and possible loan modifications, may be able to avoid entering delinquency or foreclosure. The simple step of reaching out to borrowers before they get into trouble can be very productive. In addition, a member of the Federal Reserve Board serves as a director of NeighborWorks America, which encourages borrowers facing payment difficulties to seek help by contacting their lenders, services, or trusted counselors. Recently, NeighborWorks America launched a nationwide advertising campaign to increase awareness of available support from their 24-hour hotline, and they are now responding to 2,000 calls a day, almost double the number in June.  Additionally, the Federal Reserve is working closely with community and industry groups around the country to reduce homeowners' risks of foreclosure. The community affairs offices in each of the Reserve Banks provide significant leadership and technical assistance. For instance, a public-private collaboration initiated by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago with Neighborhood Housing Services of Chicago and the City of Chicago produced the Home Ownership Preservation Initiative (HOPI), which began in 2003. In the ensuing three years, the HOPI program counseled more than 4,000 people, prevented 1,300 foreclosures, and reclaimed 300 buildings.2 HOPI has also been a model for foreclosure prevention programs now operating around the country, including in Baltimore and Atlanta and in Ohio. As another example, the community affairs office of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco recently convened a series of workshops to develop community-based solutions to mortgage delinquencies in six cities. More than 700 lenders, housing counselors, community group representatives, and government officials attended. Regulatory responses The Federal Reserve takes responsible lending and consumer protection very seriously. Along with other federal and state agencies, we are responding to the subprime problems on a number of fronts. We are committed to preventing problems from recurring, while still preserving responsible subprime lending.  Last year, in coordination with other federal supervisory agencies, we issued principles-based guidance describing safety-and-soundness and consumer-protection standards for nontraditional mortgages, such as interest-only and negative-amortization mortgages. We subsequently issued illustrations to help institutions clearly communicate information to consumers. In June of this year the agencies issued supervisory guidance on subprime ARMs. The guidance describes standards that banks should follow to ensure that borrowers obtain loans that they can afford to repay and that give them the opportunity to refinance without prepayment penalty for a reasonable period before the interest rate resets. We have requested public comment on illustrations to help lenders implement this guidance.  The Board also is committed to providing more-effective disclosures to help consumers defend against improper lending. As I discussed in my testimony to this Committee in July, we recently issued proposed rules under Regulation Z, which implements the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), to improve disclosures related to credit cards and other revolving credit accounts. We are now engaged in a similarly rigorous review of TILA rules for mortgage loans and will be conducting extensive consumer testing of mortgage disclosures for this purpose. In my view, better disclosure of the schedule of mortgage payments over the life of the loan can help borrowers understand the terms of their mortgages and judge their ability to make future payments. Consumers may also benefit from better information about costs, including brokers' fees, when choosing among competing mortgage products. In addition, we                                                  2  "The Home Ownership Preservation Initiative in Chicago (HOPI): Reducing Foreclosures Through Strategic Partnerships," presentation by Bruce Gottschall, executive director, Neighborhood Housing Services of  Chicago, June 25, 2007, http://nw.org/network/neighborworksprogs/foreclosuresolutions/documents/hopi_000.ppt.  BIS Review 104/2007 3 
are developing two sets of proposed changes to TILA rules – one to address concerns about incomplete or misleading mortgage loan advertisements and solicitations and a second to require lenders to provide mortgage disclosures more quickly so that consumers can get the information they need when it is most useful to them. Improved and more timely disclosures may not be sufficient in some cases. As I discussed in July, we will use our rulemaking authority under the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act to propose additional consumer protections later this year. We are looking closely at some mortgage lending practices, including prepayment penalties, escrow accounts for taxes and insurance, stated-income and low-documentation lending, and the evaluation of a borrower's ability to repay. The information that we gathered at a public hearing in June and from the subsequent comment letters has been extremely helpful. The recent problems in subprime lending have underscored the need not only for better disclosure and new rules but also for more-uniform enforcement in the fragmented market structure of brokers and lenders. In that regard, the CSBS has partnered with the American Association of Residential Mortgage Regulators (AARMR) to develop a nationwide licensing system and database for mortgage professionals, and they have made considerable progress. The system is expected to start up in January 2008 with seven states, and another thirty states have committed and will be added gradually. Such a nationwide system would help limit the ability of originators who run afoul of their state regulators to continue operating simply by moving to another state.  Raising the quality of underwriting practices by all lenders to a uniformly high standard is an important objective. To that end, the Board and the other federal agencies worked with the CSBS to apply the two guidance documents I mentioned – on nontraditional mortgages and subprime ARMs – to state-supervised institutions. The CSBS published nearly identical guidance documents and has urged the states to implement them. Many states have done so, or are moving to do so.  To achieve strong and uniform enforcement, interagency cooperation among a variety of federal and state agencies is essential. As I noted in my testimony in July, the Board has launched a pilot program with the CSBS, AARMR, the Office of Thrift Supervision, and the Federal Trade Commission. The goal of this program is to expand and improve consumer protection by strengthening compliance reviews at selected nondepository lenders with significant subprime-mortgage operations. The Board will review nonbank subsidiaries of bank holding companies, and the other agencies will conduct similar reviews of nondepository institutions of thrift holding companies, independent mortgage lending companies, and mortgage brokers doing business with these entities. The reviews will include an evaluation of the companies' underwriting standards and senior-management oversight of the practices used for ensuring compliance with consumer protection regulations and laws. The agencies have been working closely together and are scheduled to begin the on-site reviews in the fourth quarter. The partner agencies will share information about the reviews and make joint assessments of lessons learned. This project should also lay the groundwork for various additional forms of future cooperation to ensure more effective and consistent supervision and consumer protection. Legislative responses Beyond the actions underway at the regulatory agencies, I am aware that the Congress is considering statutory changes to help alleviate the problem of foreclosures. Modernizing the programs administered by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) is one promising direction. The FHA has considerable experience in providing home financing for low- and moderate-income borrowers. It insures mortgages made to borrowers who meet certain underwriting criteria and who pay premiums into a reserve fund that is designated to cover the costs in the event of default. This insurance makes the loans less risky for lenders and 4 BIS Review 104/2007 
investors, and it makes the loans eligible for securitization through the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae).  Historically, the FHA has played an important role in the mortgage market, particularly for first-time home buyers. However, the FHA's share of first-lien home purchase loans declined substantially, from about 16 percent in 2000 to about 5 percent in 2006, as borrowers who might have sought FHA backing instead were attracted to nontraditional products with more-flexible and quicker underwriting and processing. In addition, maximum loan values that the FHA will insure have failed to keep pace with rising home values in many areas of the country.  In modernizing FHA programs, Congress might wish to be guided by design principles that allow flexibility and risk-based pricing. To alleviate foreclosures, the FHA could be encouraged to collaborate with the private sector to expedite the refinancing of creditworthy subprime borrowers facing large resets. Other changes could allow the agency more flexibility to design new products that improve affordability through features such as variable maturities or shared appreciation. In addition, creating risk-based FHA insurance premiums that match insurance premiums with borrowers' credit profiles would give more households access to refinancing options.  The risk of moral hazard must be considered in designing government-backed programs; such programs should not bail out failed investors, as doing so would only encourage excessive risk-taking. One must also consider adverse selection; programs that provide credit to only the weakest eligible borrowers are likely to be more costly than those that serve a broader risk spectrum. Risk-based insurance premiums or tighter screening and monitoring by lenders can mitigate adverse selection. But ultimately such mechanisms have their limits, and no government program will be able to provide meaningful help to the highest-risk borrowers without a public subsidy. Whether such subsidies should be employed is a decision for the Congress. The government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are, to a limited extent, assisting in subprime refinancings and should be encouraged to provide products for subprime borrowers to the extent permitted by their charters. However, the GSE charters are likely to limit the ability of the GSEs to serve any but the most creditworthy subprime borrowers. Indeed, if GSE programs remove the strongest borrowers from the pool, the risks faced by other programs – such as a modernized FHA program – could be increased.  Some have suggested that the GSEs could help restore functioning in the secondary markets for non-conforming mortgages (specifically jumbo mortgages, those with principal value greater than $417,000) if the conforming-loan limits were raised. However, in my view, the reason that GSE securitizations are well-accepted in the secondary market is because they come with GSE-provided guarantees of financial performance, which market participants appear to treat as backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, even though this federal guarantee does not exist. Evidently, market participants believe that, in the event of the failure of a GSE, the government would have no alternative but to come to the rescue. The perception, however inaccurate, that the GSEs are fully government-backed implies that investors have few incentives in their role as counterparties or creditors to act to constrain GSE risk-taking. Raising the conforming-loan limit would expand this implied guarantee to another portion of the mortgage market, reducing market discipline further. If, despite these considerations, the Congress were inclined to move in this direction, it should assess whether such action could be taken in a way that is both explicitly temporary and able to be implemented sufficiently promptly to serve its intended purpose. Any benefits that might conceivably accrue to this action would likely be lost if implementation were significantly delayed, as private securitization activity would likely be inhibited in the interim.  BIS Review 104/2007 5 
Implications for financial markets and monetary policy Most recently, as I am sure Committee members are well aware, subprime mortgage losses that triggered uncertainty about structured products more generally have reverberated in broader financial markets, raising concern about the consequences for economic activity. As I noted in a speech last month at the economic symposium hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, the turbulence originated in concerns about subprime mortgages, but the resulting global financial losses have far exceeded even the most pessimistic estimates of the credit losses on these loans. These wider losses reflect, in part, a significant increase in investor uncertainty centered on the difficulty of evaluating the risks for a wide range of structured securities products, which can be opaque or have complex payoffs. Investors also may have become less willing to assume risk. Some increase in premiums that investors require to take risk is probably a healthy development on the whole, as these premiums have been exceptionally low for some time. However, in this episode, the shift in risk attitudes combined with greater credit risk and uncertainty about how to value those risks has created significant market stress. On the positive side of the ledger, past efforts to strengthen capital positions and financial market infrastructure places the global financial system in a relatively strong position to work through this process.  In response to these developments, the Federal Reserve moved in early August to provide reserves to address unusual strains in money markets. On August 17, the Federal Reserve Board announced a cut in the discount rate of 50 basis points and adjustments to the Reserve Banks' usual discount window practices to facilitate the provision of term financing for as long as thirty days, renewable by the borrower. The purpose of the discount window actions was to assure depositories of the ready availability of a backstop source of liquidity. The Federal Reserve also took a number of supplemental actions, such as cutting the fee charged for lending Treasury securities. Earlier this week, Federal Open Market Committee lowered its target for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points. The action was intended to help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might arise from the disruptions in financial markets and to promote moderate growth over time. Recent developments in financial markets have increased the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook. The Committee will continue to assess the effects of these and other developments on economic prospects and will act as needed to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth. 6 BIS Review 104/2007 
Ardian Fullani: Regional cooperation in South East Europe Speech by Mr Ardian Fullani, Governor of the Bank of Albania, at the conference organised by the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Sarajevo, 13-14 September 2007. *      *      * I.  Introduction It is a pleasure to be here today and engage in this discussion on strengthening regional cooperation. This meeting in Bosnia builds upon other important activities in which we have come together to discuss similar issues. It is one thing to organize one activity where the governors of all central banks come together to share their views and agree upon importance of regional cooperation, but it is completely another thing to have them to bind themselves to continue the institutional dialogue. Today, we present another proof of such commitment and show that regional cooperation in SEE is not a slogan but a real process with real results and products.  II.  Why cooperation? In general the nature and the character of any form of cooperation is shaped by the most important problems that central banks deal with. Therefore the stage of economic development, and economic and social challenges faced by our economies are bound to play an important role in this cooperation.  a.  Common challenges While the overall region seems to experience macroeconomic stability, issues that the central banks face today in their respective jurisdictions with their main partners bear striking resemblance. Most importantly we share the same partners. We have all accepted the same challenges and set similar priorities which converge to the same objectives. Dealing with a much faster globalization of financial sector than the rest of the economy, guarding macroeconomic and financial stability in face while this is happening, and the challenge of European integration define similar problems across the region. Structural reforms I would consider as the main future challenge. Building a stable financial system, enhancing financial infrastructure, improving financial markets, deepening and broadening through innovative initiatives provides fundamental ground for such cooperation. The memories of the latest episodes that have trembled financial markets in the western hemisphere, and the architecture of the financial system that is developing in our region (meaning the same banks becoming major players in each country) should make us aware of the potential risks. They indicate that each financial market remains highly exposed toward negative phenomenon that could develop in any of the region’s economies.  b.  Common destination In this respect, I see enormous possibility for cooperation and policy coordination in the direction of information sharing, institution building, modification of the legal infrastructure and lobbying in European structures. Facing these problems in group rather than separately will allow to benefit and embrace the positive effects of “economies of scale”. I also invite the ECB and EC to explore the possibility of adopting a “party” treatment for the entire SEE region, by adopting a specific program for a specific group of countries.  The process of mergers and acquisitions has incorporated financial system of the region into the bigger European market. This market driven, business initiative of the financial community, calls for institutional integration as well. Bringing central banks of the region into BIS Review 104/2007 1 
the appropriate European structures has the potential to minimize the probability of dangerous drifting apart into worthless initiatives and create positive energy.  I encourage foreign partners as well as donor agencies to adopt the same logic of coordination in the process of the compilation and implementation of technical assistance in areas of integration, institutional building, and financial stability process. This approach and will benefit the region in several ways but most importantly it will avoid major economic and social disparities between our economies, which in the long run have the potential to develop into serious threats to stability. On the other hand, several differences emerge in certain areas of developments. Yet, this provides further room for cooperation. It is a fact that our economies have adopted diverse approaches toward establishing macroeconomic and financial stability. We are at different stages of integration. It is probably due to these diverse characteristics that contagion has not been a prevailing phenomenon in SEE region. Along the path of transition our economies have encountered distinct problems in different moments. Just to point out a few examples:  • Credit has penetrated deep in the culture of some economies in the region while it still remains a fast growing new phenomenon in a few others;  • Some of us have experienced high capital inflows while the others expect to have in the future; • Some pegged their currencies to Euro; the others have not. For the rest of the region it is very important to know what triggered such different choices. How did authorities respond to such problems, what to expect, how to react? Due to these different paths that we have taken and nature of the problems that each economy has encountered, we are positioned in different parts of the learning curve. There is a great deal of learning by doing experience we have accumulated during this period of existence, and I believe that this knowledge must be shared. c. Common achievements We have succeeded to establish a network of communication with all central banks in the region among governors. I have noticed that they have always expressed their enthusiasm to intensify regional cooperation in this context. I am also happy to say that during my contacts with respective international organizations, they have highly endorsed our cooperation and have promised their support with regard to specific problems that characterize financial and economic development of our region. I want to take this opportunity to thank my dear colleagues (friends I should say) and the institutions that they lead for the significant efforts and distinguished contributions provided in several important activities that are or will be organized by the Bank of Albania in the context of financial stability, monetary policy decision making, foreign reserve management and economic research. III.  How to cooperate? On personal grounds I can also identify other important areas of fruitful cooperation which bear common benefits. I would like to encourage the establishment of an annual SEE Central Banks Forum. This forum could discuss in details topics such as financial stability, statistics, payment systems, economic research, and why not human resources. I would like to encourage active participation of the second and third level Central Banks’ managers in this “Forum – to be”. They must follow the example of their governors and engage in a closer cooperation. They should not only follow up issues discussed and decided amongst governors, but they can open a dialogue and exchange opinions, identify the best business practices and standards and then adopt those in their daily work.  2 BIS Review 104/2007 
IV.  Conclusion I do not know how many times I might have mentioned the word “cooperation” today, but I hope that you will still tolerate me to close my discussion by saying that I strongly believe in the regional cooperation. I will never stop promoting this important process among financial systems of the Balkans.  Dear governors, we have all spent enough time and energy on this important topic, to know that you share the same opinion as I do. The regional countries are on the right track, leaving behind the status of transition countries and joining the community of developing market economies. The central banks in the region need to play their irreplaceable role in order to sustain their countries in their path to common progress and reforms.  So let’s keep up such attitude toward cooperation, it will build confidence in the region and enhance our efficiency. I wish the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina success and prosperity for the many years to come. Thank you. BIS Review 104/2007 3 
Philipp Hildebrand: (The) productivity (imperative) Summary of a speech by Mr Philipp Hildebrand, Vice-Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at Avenir suisse, Zurich, 24 September 2007. The complete speech can be found in German on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). *      *      * Just a few years ago, the weak growth of the Swiss economy was a dominant topic in public debate. For four years now, the economy has been advancing strongly. Is this merely a cyclical boom? Or has structural change taken place, affecting both productivity and the associated potential growth path? This would have far-reaching implications, not least for monetary policy. A number of factors indicate that structural change is indeed occurring and that this could ultimately result in an increase in the underlying productivity trend. However, time lags and cyclical distortions make it difficult to identify such changes. BIS Review 104/2007 1 
Kevin M Warsh: Financial market developments Remarks by Mr Kevin M Warsh, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, to the State University of New York at Albany’s School of Business, Albany, New York, 21 September 2007. The original speech, which contains various links to the documents mentioned, can be found on the US Federal Reserve System’s website.  *      *      * It is good to be back in upstate New York. Thank you to the School of Business of the University of Albany for inviting me. I am particularly heartened to see old friends, new students, and prominent business leaders in attendance. I played in the New York State Public High School Tennis Championships on the other side of this campus, so this is certainly familiar terrain. However, I hope to perform better in my remarks today than I did with my racquet twenty years ago.  I have been honored to serve in Washington, D.C. for the past 5-1/2 years. My knowledge of the economy has deepened by working with my colleagues to put fiscal and monetary policy into practice. Nonetheless, with each passing day, it is more obvious that I learned much of what I need to know about the real economy in my first eighteen years here in upstate New York.  The current period of heightened financial market volatility has drawn more attention than usual to the policy actions of the Federal Reserve. Returning home at this time serves as a useful reminder that the decisions we make in Washington matter on the front lines of the real economy. Our monetary tools, for example, affect the ability of aspiring homeowners to take out a first mortgage. They also matter to retirees on fixed budgets, who are vulnerable to escalating prices, and to graduates of this and other universities looking for jobs. Our supervision and regulatory policies, to cite another example, matter to businesses, large and small, looking to borrow from banks to expand their operations.  On the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), my colleagues and I seek to deploy our monetary policy tools to help keep the U.S. economy on an even keel.1 We try to provide the right mix of policy prescriptions, patience, and perspective to counter possible adverse developments. In evaluating the state of the U.S. economy, its prospects, and the current stance of policy, we typically turn to such arcana from the economics textbooks as the term structure of interest rates, the shape of the Phillips curve, trends on the natural rate of unemployment, changing risk premiums, the exchange value of the dollar, and marginal propensities to consume as asset values change, to name just a few.  While these indicators and relationships are important, many of the enduring teachings needed to evaluate the financial markets and U.S. economy (particularly in times of financial tumult) are well known without the technical jargon all across the country: Trees don't grow to the sky. There is no free lunch. You shouldn't put all your eggs in one basket. There is no substitute for doing your own homework. And my favorite, that which can't go on forever usually doesn't.2                                                   1  The views expressed herein are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of other members of the Board of Governors or of the Federal Open Market Committee. I am grateful for the assistance of Nellie Liang and Daniel Covitz of Board staff, who contributed to these remarks. 2  That is a slight paraphrasing of Herbert Stein's self-styled "Stein's Law" (Herbert Stein, 1998, What I Think: Essays on Economics, Politics, and Life, Washington: AEI Press, p. 32). BIS Review 104/2007 1 
My intent today is not to suggest that the Federal Reserve is somehow omniscient regarding the path of the U.S. economy. Nor is it my intent to suggest that the Federal Reserve's knowledge and tools are sufficiently surgical to steer the U.S. economy completely unscathed through the choppy waters of financial market turbulence. And of course, I do not literally mean to suggest that common aphorisms provide an infallible compass to guide the economy past shocks of one sort or another. Instead, my goal is to describe the Federal Reserve's monetary responsibilities, highlight the critical role of liquidity in financial markets, and discuss the recent financial market turmoil. While the subprime-mortgage markets showed some of the earliest and most pronounced indications of weakness, I believe that problems afflicting the subprime-mortgage markets served more as the trigger than the fundamental cause of recent market turmoil and economic uncertainty. Monetary responsibilities and financial markets By way of background, allow me to highlight the Federal Reserve's dual mandate for monetary policy, as embodied in the Federal Reserve Act. The Federal Reserve's statutory objectives are to institute policies that foster maximum employment and price stability. To ensure that these objectives are consistent with each other and with strong, enduring economic performance over time, my colleagues, past and present, interpret "maximum employment" to mean maximum sustainable employment. In pursuing this objective, the Federal Reserve is trying to foster an environment in which those who are looking for work can reasonably find it. Similarly, we generally interpret our congressional mandate to ensure "price stability" to mean that inflation (the rate of price change for a broad range of products and services) is at sufficiently low and predictable levels so that it is not a factor in the economic planning of households and businesses. The principal instruments of monetary policy conducted by the Federal Reserve – open market operations, the discount rate, and reserve requirements – do not operate in a vacuum.3 Rather, they operate dynamically in association with ever-changing financial market conditions to produce effects on the real economy. Indeed, well-functioning financial markets are a precondition for a sustainable, prosperous economy. Financial markets facilitate the flow of capital from individuals and institutions that have savings to individuals and institutions with investment opportunities that are deemed worthwhile. When functioning properly, financial markets may also lower financing costs by allocating risks to suppliers of capital most willing and able to bear them. Investments that build human and physical capital, in turn, generate economic growth and ultimately raise living standards. In addition, financial markets should serve as a shock absorber of sorts for both individuals and businesses. The capital cushions of financial intermediaries, for example, should help mitigate the impact of financial shocks on the overall economy.  Conversely, when financial markets function poorly, the capital allocation process I just described is impaired, and worthwhile investment projects may go unfunded. In the extreme, savers refuse to part with their funds for capital investments at virtually any price. Instead, they retreat to the shore for safety, waiting for calmer seas and cooler heads to prevail. As I have noted previously, "While policymakers and market participants know with certainty that these episodes will occur, [we] must be humble in [our] ability to predict the timing, scope, and duration of these periods of financial distress."4                                                 3  A fuller description of the tools available to Federal Reserve policymakers is in Laurence H. Meyer (1998), "Come with Me to the FOMC," Gillis Lecture, speech delivered at Williamette University, Salem, Ore., April 2, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents. 4  Kevin Warsh (2007), "Market Liquidity: Definitions and Implications," speech delivered at the Institute of International Bankers Annual Washington Conference, Washington, March 5, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents. 2 BIS Review 104/2007 
To avoid these outcomes altogether, some believe that the Federal Reserve should treat financial stability itself as a goal. Often that is seen to imply a preference by policymakers for the perpetuation of existing financial institutions and products. That is not a view I share. The level of economic activity would invariably be lower if financial stability alone were our guiding light; protecting incumbents at the expense of innovators would prove detrimental to the long-term vibrancy of the economy. We should be extremely wary of protecting financial institutions and their various stakeholders from incurring losses. Such actions distort asset prices and critically impair the efficiency of capital allocation. The desire for well-functioning markets does not require us to insulate asset prices or individual financial institutions from the buffeting of the marketplace. Liquidity and well-functioning financial markets Now, let me briefly highlight a key attribute of well-functioning financial markets: they function best when they attract sufficient liquidity. In previous remarks, I advanced the notion that liquidity can be thought of as roughly comparable to investor confidence.5 Liquidity exists when investors are confident and willing to assume risks. And liquidity persists when risks are quantifiable and investors are creditworthy.  To trace the origins of recent financial markets turmoil, let's recall a time when the environment was more benign and financial markets were flush with liquidity. This does not require a long memory, as it aptly characterized our capital markets just four months ago. In early June, I remarked that:  There is little doubt, then, that liquidity in most financial markets is high today and that investors seem willing to take risks, even at today's market-prevailing prices. In the United States, term premiums on long-term Treasury yields are very low, corporate bonds appear to be nearly “priced for perfection,” and stock prices are setting new records. Credit markets are highly accommodative for issuers, and the volume of loans to finance highly leveraged transactions is escalating rapidly.6These financial market conditions were, in part, I argued, the consequence of a long period of remarkably supportive macroeconomic conditions, the acceleration in financial innovation, particularly the growth of structured finance products, and the continued export of the culture of capitalism to emerging-market countries. Taken together, confidence fostered the continued propagation of new securities, new products, and new markets. Not surprisingly, liquidity was ample. Did success sow the seeds of distress? So, what could go wrong? In times of abundant liquidity, investors that were no longer comfortable with their financial positions could readily sell their holdings. Similarly, financial institutions could distribute the securities they originated with few constraints. Like others who had grown increasingly watchful about the ebullience in the financial markets, I wondered whether the risks were being given their due: These prices, terms and credit conditions may reflect solid economic fundamentals – low output and inflation uncertainty, healthy corporate balance sheets, and corporate profits that exceed market expectations –                                                  5  Kevin Warsh (2007), "Financial Intermediation and Complete Markets," speech delivered at the European Economics and Financial Centre, London, June 5, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents. 6  Warsh, "Financial Intermediation and Complete Markets." BIS Review 104/2007 3 
and if so, they may help to ease the effects of fluctuations in liquidity should they occur. The prices and conditions may also reflect increased appetite for risk; or, far less auspiciously, they may be indicative of investor overconfidence.7Confidence can be fleeting. Confidence can beget complacency. If, in liquid times, investors in structured products become complacent, they may not understand fully the value of the underlying assets. High levels of confidence, perhaps even complacency, were also observable in the behavior of many financial intermediaries. Many hedge funds, growing in size and scope, invested in less-liquid assets in search of higher expected returns. Many commercial banks increased sponsorship of structured investment vehicles to invest in long-term securities, often financing them off-balance-sheet with short-term commercial paper. Those financial intermediaries that recognized the risks of extrapolating high levels of liquidity indefinitely were threatened with eroding market share and less-impressive profit profiles. They may have hoped that robust trading markets would allow them to exit positions ahead of a crowded trade. But, to paraphrase an old Wall Street saw, they don't ring a bell when the markets are at the top or at the bottom.  As you know, liquidity conditions started to deteriorate by mid-July. Subprime-mortgage markets suffered significantly from a rapid withdrawal of liquidity. They were a particularly tempting target: Many subprime mortgage products were newer, performance histories were shorter, prices were rising faster, securitization structures were more complex, disclosure was more opaque, and credit standards were weaker than most other asset classes.  But, were subprime credit problems the source of contagion causing broader reductions in liquidity and market functioning, as has become a common refrain? Or did reductions in liquidity – and concomitant changes in investor sentiment – simply manifest themselves first in the subprime-mortgage markets? If the latter is the case, then the true causes of recent financial tumult may well have preceded the turmoil in the subprime-mortgage markets altogether. And policy prescriptions should be judged accordingly. Subprime lending: the spark, not the cause Throughout the summer, delinquency rates for subprime adjustable-rate mortgages jumped as house prices decelerated and effective interest rates rose. The rate of serious delinquencies for subprime mortgages with adjustable interest rates reached close to 15 percent in July. Investors incurred large losses from forced sales of securities backed by subprime mortgages. Credit-rating agencies downgraded numerous securities backed by subprime and alt-A mortgages.  The resulting investor skepticism about the accuracy of ratings, combined with mounting losses at mortgage lenders, caused investors to pull back from a broad range of structured products, even though unrelated to mortgages. Financing for leveraged buyouts halted; demand for securities backed by syndicated loans evaporated. Investors began to shun non-mortgage related asset-backed commercial paper. These subsequent financial problems may not be a reflection of subprime contagion after all. Instead, it may be that investors fundamentally lost confidence in their ability to value a broad range of assets, particularly those that rely on robust securitization and secondary markets. Moreover, uncertainty about the ability of large financial institutions to fund their commitments eroded confidence in counterparties more generally. Risk premiums and term premiums rose rapidly, and investors sought refuge. The principles, products, and practices                                                  7  Warsh, "Financial Intermediation and Complete Markets." 4 BIS Review 104/2007 
that served so many so well for so long seemed somehow ill-suited to the evolving financial architecture.  Markets that rely less on securitizations, and are more transparent, have fared better in recent days and weeks. The stock market, while quite volatile, is about unchanged from mid-June levels. In the corporate bond market, spreads have widened somewhat, but current levels are close to historic averages, and issuance of investment-grade bonds has been quite sizable. Issuance of speculative-grade bonds has been sharply reduced, but aside from difficulties of LBO-related deals, this may reflect issuers' willingness to await improved conditions.  Not unlike prior episodes, it seems increasingly apparent that many investors and financial intermediaries became so content with the benign economic conditions and robust financial markets that they tended to act with confidence greater than warranted by the fundamentals. Indeed, some may have overly relied on credit ratings as sole gatekeepers for evaluating risks. So perhaps, in some sense, markets can become too liquid. In this case, markets may appear to function smoothly, but the risk-based pricing that lies at the heart of how financial markets efficiently allocate capital is impaired. The gloss of confidence may cause a misallocation of resources, and investors and financial intermediaries can be sidelined for a time, undermining the normal functioning of market operations.  Conclusion Some months ago, I asked, "What happens when liquidity falters?"8 Highlighting the risks of a liquidity shock at some indeterminate point in the future is easier than ascertaining the consequences with precision. Reduced liquidity conditions in markets today stem from a pullback in investors' willingness to take risks, which may have been triggered, but I argue not caused, by losses in subprime-mortgage markets. Thus, a broader reassessment of risk positions appears at work, especially for products that are opaque or complex. Investors who had relied on credit ratings alone are now confronted with having to perform their own credit and market valuations. Some may now find they are not well-equipped to make these evaluations. How quickly markets normalize may depend on the speed with which investors and counterparties gain comfort in their abilities to value assets. The adjustment process by private investors has increased the risk that banks may increasingly be called upon as backup providers of funding. The Federal Reserve responded to these developments by providing reserves to the banking system; it announced a cut in the discount rate of 50 basis points and adjustments to the Reserve Banks' usual discount window practices to facilitate the provision of term financing. In addition, earlier this week, the FOMC lowered its target for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points. The action was intended to help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might arise from the disruptions in financial markets and to promote moderate growth over time. Recent developments in financial markets, including impaired price discovery, have increased the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook. What originated as a liquidity shock could potentially give rise to increases in credit risk. The Committee will continue to assess the effects of these and other developments on economic prospects and will act as needed to meet our dual mandate, fostering price stability and economic growth.                                                   8  Warsh, "Financial Intermediation and Complete Markets."

Christian Noyer: Three questions on inflation and money Speech by Mr Christian Noyer, Governor of the Bank of France, at the European Economics and Financial Centre (EEFC), London, 11 September 2007. *      *      * Keeping inflation in check is Central Banks' main objective. Understanding the inflation process is Central Banks main concern. In recent years, we can take satisfaction in the fact that price stability has been achieved in most countries. At the same time, inflation dynamics may have become more complex. Our ability to consolidate our past successes in the future may well depend on our capacity to further deepen our knowledge on what, ultimately, determines the inflation rate. Today, I would like to address three specific questions which have been extensively discussed, but not yet fully answered, in the academic and policy-making community: what is the impact of globalisation on inflation? Has the inflation – output trade-off changed as a consequence? And, finally, how can money aggregates help us in our efforts to achieve price stability? Globalisation and inflation In the last twenty years, greater integration in goods, services, labour and capital markets has coincided with stable and low inflation. Is there a link? Globalisation has made a significant contribution to price stability. With new large new players (such as China and India, or Eastern European countries) entering the world economy, cheap imports have become available to developed countries. The fall in import prices in developed economies allowed real consumption wages to grow without impacting real production wages. This, in turn, has raised the level of employment compatible with price stability, or, put differently, lowered the inflation rate for any given level of employment. The effects of globalisation may also be felt more indirectly through increased competition, both on the products and labour markets. On the products market, globalisation has eliminated the least productive domestic firms (those that set the highest prices) and reduced the pricing power of remaining domestic firms. It may also have created the conditions for wage moderation by increasing the degree of competition on the labour market. Overall, these developments have made it easier for Central Banks to bring down inflation without real costs to the economy. But it is doubtful that we can count indefinitely on such "tailwinds". Inflation only partly depends upon imported prices. Many goods and most services are still produced domestically with little competition from abroad. Domestic factors thus remain crucial determinants of inflation rates. Globalisation lowers the relative price of tradables to non-tradables in an open economy. But the overall level and dynamics of prices ultimately remain determined by the monetary authorities provided they ensure that steady growth in overall nominal demand is maintained through an appropriate monetary policy.1In addition, it is possible that the effects of globalisation on inflation will be reversed in the future. Strong growth in big emerging economies is increasingly putting pressures on the price of oil, food and other commodities. While labour supply in these countries will remain abundant, it is not all that clear whether it will remain cheap. Indeed, we are currently seeing                                                  1  Speech by Charles Bean, “Globalisation and Inflation”, to the LSE Economic Society, 24 October 2006. BIS Review 103/2007 1 
an increase in export prices in emerging countries, which translates into higher import prices for developed economies. This inflationary impact seems to have grown over the past few years, while, by contrast, the disinflationary impact of globalisation seems to have slowed down. Going further, some analysts have suggested that, because of capital market integration, real interest rates will equalize around the world, thus reducing the ability of national Central Banks to control inflation. However, this need not be true. Indeed, the classic Mundell-Fleming analysis concludes that monetary policy should be more effective, rather than less, in the case of international capital mobility, although it can operate through different channels of transmission including the exchange rate. But inflation is more than the direct result of macroeconomic shocks. It is a process in which business cycles as well as expectations play an important role. Has this process changed? A change in the output – inflation trade-off? Inflation dynamics have changed over the past fifteen years or so. Inflation persistence has declined, or, in other words, upward changes in the path of prices have become more temporary and easily reversed. Also, inflation itself has become less responsive to shocks. Both are very welcome developments for monetary policy. Maybe the most documented and commented-upon change in inflation dynamics has been the so-called flattening of the Phillips curve. This, in economists' jargon, means that domestic inflation has become less sensitive to the domestic output-gap; or, alternatively, that it has become more stable during the business cycle. There are several possible – and not mutually exclusive – explanations for this phenomenon. It may well be that expectations of future inflation have become a more important determinant of current inflation at the expense of the current output gap, which would signal that monetary policies have become more effective in anchoring the inflation rate. Most explanations, however, are of a more structural nature. It is possible is that, as a result of structural reforms, the NAIRU has decreased in many countries in recent years, thus giving the "optical" impression of a horizontal Phillips curve during this period. Another interpretation is that firms change their prices less frequently both because it is less necessary in a low-inflation environment and more difficult due to increased competition, including from abroad. These arguments, however,2 have been challenged on the basis that, in an increasingly competitive environment, setting the “wrong” price has become more costly for firms in terms of foregone profits, which should encourage them to adjust their prices more frequently. If anything, according to this view, competition and globalisation should be expected to steepen the Phillips curve. In a broader sense, globalisation itself may also be responsible for the flattening of the Philips curve. In an open economy, domestic demand changes can easily be satisfied through increased imports. As a consequence, domestic inflation may become less sensitive to the domestic output gap and more sensitive to global tensions on production capacities.                                                  2  Notably put forward by Laurence Ball. 2 BIS Review 103/2007 
Finally, it is possible that (due to immigration and structural reforms) labour supply has become more elastic in many countries, and, as a consequence the cyclicality of wages (and prices) has been reduced. 3Flatter Phillips curves may be a mixed blessing for Central Banks. In such circumstances, looking at actual and projected inflation may not be sufficient to detect incipient imbalances between supply and demand. In other words, inflation becomes less informative about the output gap. There is a risk, then, that imbalances are allowed to build up to a point where a stronger reaction may become necessary. To prevent that risk, Central Banks may want to look at information coming from a broader set of indicators, chosen because of their ability to detect, at an earlier stage, potential inflationary pressures. Obviously, monetary and credit aggregates for instance are good candidates for such a job. What role for money in monetary policy? As you may know, this is precisely what is done in the context of the Eurosystem’s two-pillar monetary policy strategy which assigns an important role to money. This structure is based on a particular premise and has one important implication. The premise is that even if money has no systematic and immediate influence on prices, it can provide valuable and specific information on future inflation, at time horizons stretching beyond those usually adopted for the construction of central bank inflation projections. Because of the long-term relation between money growth and inflation, money has leading indicator properties on future price developments. Though it is fair to say that the apparent link between monetary developments and inflation has deteriorated over the recent years, there is still strong statistical evidence of a link between monetary growth and inflation at a low frequency. This relation holds for the euro area, but also for the US, the UK and large OECD countries, with monetary trends systematically leading inflation trends.4The implication referred to is the need to cross-check the information on inflationary pressures and risks to price stability; this cross-checking implies that we bring together and compare different analytical strategies and that we systematically use all the information relevant to decision making. The main issue is to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialize and that medium to longer-term inflation expectations remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with the price stability objective. Such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting sustainable economic growth as well as job creation. Of course, monetary policy does not react mechanically to monetary developments, but rather responds to the information in monetary aggregates that is relevant for maintaining price stability over the medium term. To make best use of the informational role of money, however, we have to address numerous and increasing challenges.                                                  3  It is worth noting that not everybody is convinced that globalisation has played an important role in the flattening of the Phillips curve. For instance, Frederic Mishkin, Axel Weber and Donald Kohn emphasize the uncertainty surrounding the quantification of this globalisation effect, and Laurence Ball even questions this effect on theoretical grounds. Part of these doubts comes from the apparent lack of robustness of the result indicating that domestic inflation has become more sensitive to global output-gap fluctuations, which tends to weaken the case for the globalisation explanation of the flattening of the Phillips curve. 4  Benati L. (2007), “Long-run evidence on money growth and inflation”, forthcoming in the ECB Working Paper Series. BIS Review 103/2007 3 
One major difficulty is identifying in real time the nature of monetary developments and their implications for future price developments. The challenge of monetary analysis is to see through the noise in monetary data to recover those underlying trends which are relevant for monetary policy decisions. Meeting this challenge has not been straightforward in recent years in the euro area. First of all, short-run monetary developments are often affected by transitory shocks. We need to identify and account for such temporary “special factors” or “distortions” that may affect monetary developments and blur their information content. Second, and more permanently, it is necessary to disentangle, in monetary and credit developments, those which reflect structural and permanent changes from those which simply result from movements in the level of interest rates and the position in the economic cycle. Finally, we must be able to assess whether these developments result from money supply shocks, in which case they clearly entail some risks to price stability, or whether they are caused by money demand shocks that may raise the desired level of money balances without necessarily impacting aggregate demand. Such demand shocks can be triggered by structural changes in the behaviour of economic agents or result from portfolio shifts or financial innovations in the context of financial globalisation. There are indeed some signs that a money demand shock occurred at the beginning of the 2000s in the euro area, as illustrated by a structural shift in the trend velocity of money, which summarises the relationship between money, output and the price level. 5One possible consequence of current events in credit markets may be to trigger a re-intermediation process, i.e. an expansion of banks' balance sheets which may further complicate our reading and interpretation of monetary and credit dynamics in the months to come. Conclusion There is no doubt that globalisation has impacted in various and non-trivial ways the functioning of our economies. In doing so, it has blurred the information content of many important variables or indicators relevant for the monetary policy maker, making monetary policy probably more complex in a context of increased uncertainty. Economic theory usually distinguishes between parameter and model uncertainty. In the presence of parameter uncertainty, i.e. when the policy maker is uncertain about the impact a policy instrument has on the economy, economic theory suggests that it is optimal to respond more cautiously than would be the case in the absence of uncertainty (this is the well-known Brainard conservative principle). By contrast, model uncertainty would require more active monetary policy, the idea being to insure oneself against particularly bad outcomes. I will leave it to your wisdom to guess in the present circumstances which of these two approaches would be preferable. Thank you for your attention.                                                  5  Bordes, C., Clerc L. and Marimoutou V.

Lucas Papademos: The science of monetary policy – past advances and future challenges Speech by Mr Lucas Papademos, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, at the conference on “Monetary Policy over 50 years” marking the 50th anniversary of the Deutsche Bundesbank, Frankfurt am Main, 21 September 2007. *      *      * I. Introduction  The subject of this session requires addressing a number of core issues pertaining to the effective conduct and successful performance of monetary policy. It is a subject not only of academic interest but also with important policy implications. The choice of this topic is very appropriate for a conference organised to mark the 50th anniversary of the Deutsche Bundesbank, a great institution, which has been very successful and influential in the conduct of monetary policy aimed at preserving price stability. I am delighted to participate in this celebration and thank you for the invitation. So, will monetary policy become more of a science? The way the question has been posed may implicitly reflect two presumptions, namely that, first, monetary policy does not rely sufficiently on scientific principles and methods at present, and, second, that there is some doubt or scepticism on whether monetary policy will acquire more elements of a science in the future which would be desirable. I would not agree with such implicit presumptions, although it goes without saying that the conduct of monetary policy will always require judgement given our imperfect knowledge and the inevitable uncertainty about the functioning of the economy and the impact of monetary policy actions. Frederic Mishkin provided us with an excellent and comprehensive review of the progress made by monetary policy in becoming more of a science over the past fifty years and an assessment of the limitations to the science of monetary policy. He also highlighted two recent episodes in the United States that demonstrated how “judgement” was informed by “science” and resulted in appropriate monetary policy decisions in a changing and uncertain economic environment; and he discussed some of the gaps in the science of monetary policy that are likely to be filled in the future. I broadly agree with his review of the advances made in recent decades towards making monetary policy more of a science. These advances have allowed monetary policy to be based on a set of “scientific principles and to rely more on concrete econometric models – of increasing sophistication and policy relevance – when making decisions on the appropriate monetary policy stance. His review and assessment of scientific principles and econometric models that can respectively, guide and provide a useful basis for decision-making, reflect his knowledge and contribution as an academic and his experience as a central banker. And I fully share the view about the need to continue pursuing research and analysis that can provide a stronger scientific basis for monetary policy, while, of course, recognising that monetary policy-making will never be transformed into a routine process of mechanical application of principles and rules. Nevertheless, there are several issues I would like to elaborate further pertaining to (i) the role and importance of the core scientific principles that should guide monetary policy; (ii) the current state and limitations of the scientific aspects of monetary policy-making; and (iii) the orientation of our future efforts towards enhancing the science and effectiveness of monetary policy. II.  The science of monetary policy: the role and significance of core principles In order to assess whether and to which degree monetary policy can be characterised as a science or has features of a science, it is useful to keep in mind that the two concepts “science” and “policy” are rather distinct and to explain what precisely we mean when we ask BIS Review 103/2007 1 
whether monetary policy will become more of a science. After all, the science of a specific subject is the systematic and organised body of knowledge on that subject, knowledge which is founded on objective principles involving the observation of, and experiment with, certain phenomena. The subject we have in mind is not monetary economics, but monetary policy, that is a course of action adopted by an authority to achieve certain objectives. All this may sound a bit too philosophical or abstract, but we need some precision and a systematic approach to address the issue in a meaningful way. To this end, it is necessary to define monetary policy in greater detail. In trying to identify the “systematic knowledge” and “core principles” of monetary policy, and how these in turn derive from theoretical propositions and are supported by the empirical evidence, I find it useful to think of monetary policy as comprising three essential components: • the institutional setting • the policy framework, which includes the policy objective and the analytical foundations – theoretical and empirical – linking objectives and instruments • the communication and the actual conduct of policy. Monetary policy has become more of a science over the past fifty years because all its main components are now based on core principles derived from theoretical propositions or arguments that have been scrutinised and tested, to different degrees, on the basis of the available empirical evidence, that is by observing reality: the practice and performance of monetary policy. Let me elaborate on the nine principles presented by Mishkin also in relation to the ECB’s monetary policy framework. The first three principles that (i) inflation is fundamentally a monetary phenomenon, (ii) that price stability has important welfare benefits, including its contribution to sustained growth and reduced output volatility, and (iii) that there is no long-term trade-off between unemployment and inflation are widely accepted and clearly underpin and are reflected in the ECB’s mandate and primary policy objective. The first and third principles are also incorporated in the ECB’s analytical framework and they are overwhelmingly supported by the empirical evidence. These first three principles and the eighth principle about the importance of central bank commitment to a nominal anchor imply that price stability (or an inflation target) should be the primary, overriding objective of monetary policy. This can be considered as a separate or derived principle, which is integrated into the mandate of the ECB.  The fourth principle concerning the crucial role of expectations in the determination of inflation dynamics and in the transmission of monetary policy is also universally recognised and constitutes one of the key advances in the analytical foundations of monetary policy. The role of inflation expectations as a main channel of the monetary policy transmission mechanism motivates the focus placed by central banks on the analysis and use of several indicators of inflation expectations and explains the importance attached in the anchoring of expectations to price stability also in the ECB’s communication policy. This is an area, however, where more progress is necessary, as I will discuss later on, in order to better measure, model and favourably influence the inflation expectations of the public at large.  Two other principles, (i) the importance of central bank independence in order to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of monetary policy and (ii) the need to ensure consistent implementation of monetary policy over time, are reflected in the institutional set-up of most central banks, including the ECB. Political authorities, however, occasionally seem to ignore or forget the significance of central bank independence, which they themselves enshrined in the EU Treaty, precisely on the basis of past experience and the worldwide evidence which clearly demonstrate its contribution to effective decision-making that preserves price stability and helps minimise output volatility. Central bank independence is also crucial for ensuring that another principle – the commitment to a strong nominal anchor – is credible and thus 2 BIS Review 103/2007 
effective in ensuring price stability. For the ECB, the unambiguous commitment to price stability is reflected in the quantification of its policy objective and its communication, but most importantly in its determination and consistency in pursuing price stability (the nominal anchor). So far, I have fully agreed with the role and significance of seven, out of the nine, principles proposed by Frederic for providing the scientific underpinning of monetary policy. There are two principles, however, that I do not consider as having been fully and widely accepted and reflected in the practice of monetary policy: the principle concerning the role and usefulness of monetary policy rules and the one pertaining to the role of financial frictions in business cycles. These two principles do not belong, at least not yet, to the core propositions underlying the science of central banking not because their content is not important but for other reasons. In the case of the policy rules, the simple reason is that they are not used – by most central banks – in the actual conduct of monetary policy, although they may be used for analytical purposes and as benchmarks for comparison of the policies implemented in practice. There are several reasons why such rules are not used in the practice of monetary policy. One such reason, which I will highlight later on, is related to the imperfect inflation available for estimating reliably key variables included in these rules, in real time.  In the case of the role of financial frictions – which I consider to be especially important – I am somewhat sceptical of its inclusion in the core principles at this stage because we have not yet reached the state of knowledge to incorporate financial frictions fully in the monetary policy framework in a generally acceptable manner. This principle is likely to be included in the core principles in the future, but only after further analysis and empirical support for its validity and robustness. There is, however, a notable omission in the list of the key principles to guide the thinking at central banks and the conduct of monetary policy: the role of money, or more precisely monetary and credit aggregates, in the monetary policy transmission mechanism and in the assessment of the medium and long-term risks to price stability as well as to financial stability. This principle provides one of the foundations in the ECB’s analytical framework. I recognise that in recent years its role and significance has been deemphasised by some economists and at some central banks, but as I have argued before, the fundamental role of money in the conduct of monetary policy should not be ignored, but rather emphasised and further explored. And this should be part of the research agenda that will help us to further advance the science of monetary policy. III.  Knowledge gaps and challenges in the science of monetary policy Despite the progress made over the past decades, there are still important knowledge gaps in our understanding and modelling of the monetary policy transmission mechanism; and there are also a number of analytical and statistical (measurement) challenges that must be addressed in order to further advance the science of monetary policy. I had prepared a list of such gaps and challenges before reading Frederic Mishkin’s paper. A comparison with his list of further likely advances in the science of monetary policy showed a very large overlap both with regard to the areas for further research and the reasons given to justify the need for, or likelihood of, further progress. What I would like to do is to highlight a number of the commonly identified knowledge gaps and analytical issues, define priorities and raise some additional issues that deserve further analysis. III. 1. The role of money, credit and the financial system  In order to enhance our analysis and assessment of the impact of monetary policy on price developments, as well as on output fluctuations and asset price dynamics, in a modern economy with a sophisticated financial sector, priority must be given to the further development of structural models that incorporate a banking sector, other financial BIS Review 103/2007 3 
intermediaries and a richer specification of the structure and functioning of financial markets. The integration of the financial system, and of the banking sector in particular, in a state-of-the-art dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model that is empirically estimated, would provide a theoretically consistent framework – based on sound microfoundations – that would allow an analysis of the role of money and credit – of liquidity and financing conditions – in the transmission of the effects of monetary policy on the economy. Such models have been or are being developed at the ECB, other central banks and universities, but there is scope for further extensions and improvements. Although the task is challenging because of the complexities involved in incorporating a realistic specification of the financial sector – with financial market frictions (or imperfections) – into such models, it is important from a policy point of view that we deepen our understanding of this transmission channel of monetary policy and its implications for price and output dynamics. Moreover, as Bernanke, Mishkin, Gertler and others have shown, and as recent experience has vividly demonstrated, information asymmetries and other financial market imperfections play a crucial role in determining the stability of the financial system and business cycle fluctuations. The analysis of the role of money and credit (i) in the transmission of the effects of monetary policy and (ii) as information variables that can provide useful signals for the assessment of risks to price stability and financial stability need not be confined to the further development of DSGE models. These models have great merits but also limitations. They may not be able to capture (adequately or realistically) important features of markets such as financial innovations and other structural changes as well as the behaviour of different groups of agents characterised by fundamental differences in preferences, asymmetric information and alternative approaches to forming expectations. For example, in recent years, the supply of credit by banks has been affected by financial innovations – the securitisation of bank assets and the development of the credit risk transfer market – which resulted in the so-called “originate and distribute” business model pursued by banks. And we have all witnessed recently some of the consequences of this bank business model and certain other features of financial markets. Moreover, capital requirements, the processes of financial integration and consolidation (both within Europe and more generally on the global level) and the increasing role of non-bank financial institutions have also been influencing the expansion of credit and the creation of (monetary) liquidity. Consequently, a better understanding and modelling of these innovations and processes, as well as of the determinants of asset prices and of the sectoral demand for money and credit, is necessary in order to improve both our economic and monetary analysis and our assessment of the likely impact of a change in the monetary policy stance on financial market conditions and price developments. To this end, various avenues of analytical work are being pursued at the ECB, and more generally at the Eurosystem central banks, which draw on a wide range of complementary models and analytical tools and involve the development of new such models and tools.  The broader aim of this research on the role of money, credit and the financial system in the monetary transmission mechanism is to enhance the scientific basis – to strengthen the analytical framework – of our policy deliberations. And I am confident that the outcome of this research will provide further theoretical and empirical support to two of the core principles that should guide the conduct of monetary policy: (i) the principle I added on “the role of money and credit in the monetary policy transmission mechanism and the assessment of medium to longer term risks to price stability” and (ii) a generalisation of the principle on “the role of financial frictions for the business cycle” and, I would add, “for financial stability”.  Events in recent weeks have amply manifested the importance of financial stability for the functioning of the economy. What is less manifestly obvious is the precise relationship between financial stability considerations and monetary policy. Two aspects require, in my view, further analysis and research. First, our monitoring and assessment of financial stability so far mainly relies on qualitative evaluations and judgements. Further progress is necessary towards methods to quantify risks and vulnerabilities identified in the various segments of the 4 BIS Review 103/2007 
financial sector and to relate them, in a theoretically sound and empirically robust manner, to our overall assessment of financial stability. Second, and even more challenging, we need to understand in more detailed and verifiable manner the precise relationship between the causes and implications of financial instability and monetary policy.  III.2.  Expectations  Another priority in our research agenda is to enhance our understanding of the way expectations are formed by different agents in the economy, and how they can be managed successfully so as to improve the effectiveness of monetary policy. Inflation expectations play a crucial role in determining the impact of monetary policy on the economy and in shaping the dynamic response of prices and output to shocks. Forecasts of future price developments and policy simulations based on macroeconometric models depend critically on the modelling of expectations. By now it is widely accepted that expectations should, by and large, be formed “rationally” in the sense that they should take into account all relevant available information concerning the structure and functioning of the economy and the factors and policies – notably monetary policy – that may affect future price developments. This broad formulation about the nature and formation of expectations is perfectly reasonable, appropriate and superior to any mechanical backward-looking specification of expectations formation. In practice, however, there are crucial issues that must be addressed on how exactly “all available relevant information concerning the economy’s structure and functioning” is obtained and processed by economic agents. Often the hypothesis of “rational expectations” in incorporated in theoretical and econometric models by making simplifying and rather unrealistic assumptions about the available information to agents on the basis of which they can make “optimal forecasts” about the future. And these assumptions, which essentially relate to the nature and modalities of the associated learning and information extracting processes and the homogeneity of agents, play a crucial role in determining the dynamics of the economy and the magnitude of, and time lags in, the effects of a change in the monetary policy stance on the price level an output over time. An important implication of the central role of expectations in the monetary policy transmission process and of the “rationality” of expectations – in a broad sense – is that the effectiveness of monetary policy depends on the expectations of the markets and of the public about future policy actions. And this is the fundamental reason why the adoption and public announcement of a quantitative definition of price stability (or an operational inflation objective), the credible commitment of the central bank to this objective, and the effective communication of its policy decisions aimed at achieving this goal are crucial for the anchoring of inflation expectations to price stability. Our own experience and the track record of the ECB since 1999 have been very positive in this respect: despite the fact that the ECB, as a newly created central bank, did not have a previous track record of successful policy-making, financial markets immediately understood the ECB’s commitment to price stability as credible and factored it in their expectations. Ever since 1999, all financial market indicators and private sector forecasts suggest that expectations of future inflation have remained remarkably well anchored to the ECB’s definition of price stability. For example, expectations derived from the prices of nominal and indexed-linked bonds provide compelling evidence that long-term inflation expectations are well anchored in the euro area.  However, while market expectations appear to be “rational” in that they are in line with the ECB’s commitment and demonstrated ability to preserve price stability, the process of expectation formation among the general public appears to be rather more complex. Survey evidence suggests that in a number of euro area countries, a portion of the general public perceives inflation to deviate sometimes significantly from actual inflation or expects inflation to remain at elevated levels which bear little resemblance to actually recorded inflation or BIS Review 103/2007 5 
market expectations of future inflation. More analysis is needed to understand this discrepancy – and some promising work has already been done at the ECB in this respect. More generally, research aiming at incorporating empirically plausible theories of expectations formation into our models is of particular relevance. This will require the introduction and testing of hypotheses of how economic agents learn about the evolving structure and functioning of the economy it and may lead to a relaxation of the assumption of the representative agent which is characteristic of most of our models, including the dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models, and thus to allow for the heterogeneity of agents and expectations.  III.3.  Some modelling and methodological challenges This brings me to some key modelling and methodological challenges that deserve more attention in order to enhance the analytical tools for monetary policy:  • first, how to develop models that overcome the restrictions that are inherent in the stylised assumption of the representative agent; • second, how to cope with statistical uncertainty and data revisions, and their impact, in particular, on our estimates of important economic concepts that are relevant for policy formulation but which are not directly observable, like the potential output growth and the equilibrium values of the unemployment rate and the real interest rate; and,  • third, how to deal with possible non-linearities in economic relationships.  Today’s dynamic macroeconomic (DSGE) models, with their sound microfoundations and ability to ensure internal consistency and invariance of the reduced form parameters to policy changes, have many merits, as I said. But also limitations, and one of them is that they model aggregate economic variables by using one “representative” optimising agent whose choices coincide with the aggregate choices of the underlying group of heterogeneous individuals. Clearly, this assumption is made for analytical convenience. Yet, the conclusions drawn from these models may have far-reaching implications. In real economies, agents are organised into groups and firms, each pursuing their own economic interest. These distinct individual activities are more or less coordinated and some kind of order emerges – this is what Adam Smith called the “invisible hand”. However, the pursuit of individual optimising behaviour does not necessarily imply, a priori, optimal outcomes at an aggregate level. Indeed, many interactions in the economy that require coordination among economic agents may result in suboptimal aggregate outcomes, even if all agents pursue the same interests. In addition to coordination failures, models involving representative agents appear particularly ill-suited to address distributional issues, for example those involving employed and unemployed workers. Developing richer multiple-agent models is unquestionably difficult but should nevertheless be part of longer-term research agenda, as the potential benefits for policy-making are significant. We live – and have to make decisions – in a world of pervasive uncertainty. However, while the academic profession has made tremendous progress in analysing risk in well-defined stochastic economies, the “Knightian” uncertainty that confronts central bankers is of an altogether different dimension. Among the various forms of uncertainty that central bankers face, the uncertainty about how the policy instrument affects inflation and economic activity – the monetary transmission mechanism – and the uncertainty about the (statistical) measurement of the current state of the economy – the data – appear to weigh particularly heavily. Central bankers need to have a good understanding of the timing and the ultimate effects of changes in the monetary policy instruments on inflation and economic activity. For this purpose, monetary policy-making requires more than just the qualitative information that theory provides. They must have quantitative information about magnitudes and lags, even if that information is imperfect. At the same time, caution and circumspection in the face of 6 BIS Review 103/2007 
such model and data uncertainty is clearly warranted. Model uncertainty suggests that further analysis of the robustness of the effects of monetary policy actions across a variety of models would be valuable.  Recent research has shown that central banks should moderate the responsiveness of their policy decisions to real activity when underlying data are known to be subject to measurement error. After all, a strong policy response to mismeasured data will induce unnecessary fluctuations in the economy. In view of this, the weight given to the individual information variables should depend on how precisely those variables are measured. This is especially applicable to variables that are not directly observable, but which are relevant for policy formulation, such as the potential output growth and the equilibrium values of the real unemployment rate and the real interest rate. It would therefore be not advisable for central banks to heavily rely in their policy decisions – and in the respective communication – on models or policy rules that place an inordinate weight on such unobservable parameters, which are difficult to measure in real time, and subject to considerable uncertainty of the underlying data. My final remark on model and methodological challenges concerns the fact that most macroeconomic models today are solved and estimated in linear form, essentially relying on the linear stochastic difference approach used in macroeconomics since the 1950s. Again, this feature has merits and limitations: linear modelling techniques are powerful and easy to handle and can be scaled to larger and more complete models. But there are a number of essential policy questions that simply cannot be addressed within linear frameworks. One prominent question relates to the emergence of time-varying risk premia that are apparently influencing the behaviour of the long-end of the yield curve. Research carried out at the ECB has shown that such time-variation appears to be important for understanding the behaviour of long yields and that these premia are systematically related to economic fundamentals. Modelling them, however, requires nonlinear economic frameworks. Similarly, we might possibly need nonlinear techniques to answer the question how policy should deal with really large shocks. Linear models may give sufficiently accurate answers for dealing with small to medium-sized shocks, but if economic relationships are essentially non-linear, then such models may make considerable prediction errors in a situation where large shocks carry the economy far away from a state characterised by “average behaviour”. For all these reasons, it seems important from a policy perspective to develop and employ non-linear modelling and estimation techniques. IV.  Concluding remarks To sum up, over the past decades, tremendous progress has been made towards making monetary policy more of a science. Undoubtedly, this has contributed to enhancing the effectiveness of monetary policy. At the same time, there is still room – and indeed a need – to further advance the scientific elements of monetary policy-making by addressing a number of conceptual, methodological and empirical challenges. Some of these challenges are a consequence of the nature of the economic system and the uncertainty surrounding its evolution over time. The economic environment is continuously changing and at fast pace as a result of the actions of economic agents. Technological advances, financial innovations, the process of globalisation, even changing preferences, are influencing the structure and functioning of markets and the monetary policy transmission mechanism. Monetary policy-makers have to take decisions against the background of the evolving economic environment and then face a host of uncertainties. This makes our task challenging – but admittedly also more exciting. Moreover, these observations have two important implications for monetary policy. First, the ability to combine “science and art” in a well-structured, balanced, prudent and effective way will always remain a key feature of the successful performance of monetary policy. Second, in an environment of continuous change and considerable uncertainty, it is essential that central banks provide an anchor of stability and certainty: BIS Review 103/2007 7 
through their commitment to and delivery of price stability. This conclusion is directly linked to the purpose of this conference, to celebrate the Bundesbank’s 50-year-long unwavering dedication to its task of “safeguarding the currency” (“die Wähung zu sichern”) as it is stated in the Bundesbank Act. I am confident that 50 years from now, on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Bundesbank, a conference can be again be organised to celebrate this great achievement: “Stable money for Germany and Europe”.  Thank you very much for your attention. 8 BIS Review 103/2007 
Jean-Pierre Roth: The current economic and monetary policy situation Summary of a speech by Mr Jean-Pierre Roth, Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank for International Settlements, at the Centro di Studi Bancari, Vezia, 17 September 2007. The complete speech can be found in French on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). *      *      * It is difficult to determine to what extent the turmoil in the US sub-prime mortgage market impacts on the real economy. It has hit Switzerland at a time when our economy is in enviably good shape. Should the situation in the financial markets not deteriorate any further, it is hard to imagine these factors abruptly slowing economic growth. With its decision to let the Libor slide back towards 2.75% in the short term, the SNB has clearly signalled to the markets an easing of the situation. In Switzerland, price stability has been maintained for the past 13 years, economic growth is significantly higher than in the 1990s and our unemployment rate is the lowest of all industrialised countries. It is our goal to preserve this favourable situation. BIS Review 102/2007 1 
Y V Reddy: India – development and reform experience; and prospects Address by Dr Y V Reddy, Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the Bank of Mexico, Mexico City, 13 September 2007. *      *      * Governor Ortiz and Friends, I am delighted to be here in Mexico to address this august gathering at the Bank of Mexico. I am honoured by the invitation extended to me. Governor Ortiz is among the most respected Central Bank Governors. His perceptions and words of wisdom, based on sound understanding of theory as well as compulsions of public policy making, are eagerly sought. In fact, Governor Ortiz heads the Central Bank Governance Group in the Bank for International Settlements of which I am a Member. The talk that he delivered in the Reserve Bank of India in November 2006 on Mexico’s experience with Financial Stability is vividly remembered by all of us. Again, his elucidation of “Growth and Stability in Latin America and Asia” in the prestigious Sir Purushothamdas Thakurdas Memorial Lecture in India during the same visit is, in my view, a pioneering piece on the subject. Mexico has successfully achieved the macroeconomic and financial stability that fosters rapid economic growth. A range of specific reforms implemented in Mexico, which include to improvement in business environment and corporate governance; development of human capital; incentive-based social assistance programs; and broader access for health insurance; have attracted international interest in the Mexican economy. Monetary policy has also been able to achieve and maintain a low inflation regime, which is vital for the social well-being in emerging economies. Mexico provides an appealing development model for many developing countries. I must compliment the leading lights of public policy in Mexico for these impressive outcomes. I.  India’s development experience: pre-reform period Some hold the view that India was a poor country for most part of the human history though there were pockets of prosperity and islands of riches. However, accounts of others, especially global travellers and those who invaded India indicate that India was a prosperous country at least till the 17th century. According to an OECD publication, in 1700 AD, broadly defined, India’s gross domestic product (GDP) at US $ 90.8 billion was 24.4 per cent of world GDP (Maddison Angus, “The World Economy: A Millennium Perspective”, OECD, 2001). Lord Meghnad Desai, while delivering the first P.R. Brahmananda Memorial Lecture in Mumbai in September 2004, noted that the story of the 19th century for India is not one of gloom and doom. He added that during the second half of the 19th century, where the data are best available, India was an open economy enjoying an export led growth but there was a drain of the export surplus to pay Home Charges. During the forty year period from 1860 to 1900, the per capita income growth was 0.5 to 1 per cent. According to Lord Desai, the first fifty years of the 20th century were much less favourable for the Indian economy than the last forty years of the 19th century. Further, in a book titled “The National Income of India in the Twentieth Century”, Professor Sivasubramonian observed that in the first five decades of the 20th century (1900-01 to 1946-47), before we got our independence in 1947, the per capita GDP in India was stagnant, as the trend growth in GDP during this period was 0.9 per cent with population growing by 0.8 per cent (Sivasubramonian, S., Oxford University Press, 2000). As compared with near stagnant growth in the first 50 years of the 20th century, it could be seen from Table 1 (Attached), the annual growth averaging around 3.5 per cent during the period 1950 to 1980 was comparatively better, while per capita growth broke out of the long period of inertia and averaged 1.1 per cent until around 1980. The average growth rate of BIS Review 102/2007 1 
around 6 per cent since the 1980s, while embarking on a higher average growth path of 8.6 per cent in the last four years could be a paradigm shift.  The Indian experience clearly suggests that the mixed-economy model and planned development strategy in the first phase during the 1950s and 1960s, improved growth rate dramatically relative to previous decades, and also provided the essential building blocks and laid the strong foundations of an indigenous industrial base, vibrant entrepreneurial class, knowledge economy, with considerable improvement in vertical, social and economic mobility. However, the inward looking import substitution strategy pursued during the initial decades of the planning period resulted in declining productivity and high cost economy. Realizing this, significant changes in policy were initiated in the early 1980s, taking account of oil shocks in the 1970s and early 1980s. These policy measures took India into a higher growth trajectory in the 1980s but in its wake created some macroeconomic imbalances leading to a crisis in 1991 that triggered more comprehensive and sustainable reforms. The policies since 1991 provided ample opportunities to build on the strong foundations in economic, political and social sphere, laid during the pre-reform period of planned development. II.  Development experience: post-reform period  Triggers of reforms  The policy reforms in the 1980s provided impetus for high growth and enhanced competitiveness but the growth process turned unsustainable. It manifested in the growing macroeconomic imbalances over the decade in the form of high fiscal deficit, high levels of current account deficit, and increasing levels of short term external debt, besides a repressive and weakened financial system. The immediate provocation for the crisis in 1991 was also a combination of external events that generated liquidity problems on the external front. The gulf crisis of 1991 not only affected India’s oil imports due to soaring oil prices but also eroded export markets in West Asia, and caused a setback to inward remittances and tourist earnings. The deterioration in exports to Eastern Europe, with the break-up of erstwhile USSR, accentuated the crisis. Around the same time, India’s credit rating was lowered, which restricted its access to commercial borrowings and there was unwillingness on the part of normal banking channels to renew short-term credit to Indian banks abroad. Exceptional financing measures became inevitable, and the overall deficit in 1990-91 was financed almost equally by recourse to IMF and drawdown of reserves. The severity of the balance of payments crisis in the early 1990s could be gauged from the fact that India’s foreign currency assets depleted rapidly from US $ 3.1 billion in August 1990 to US $ 975 million on July 12, 1991. I would now narrate the story of our exciting journey from the agony of 1991 to relative comfort in 2007, and conclude by mentioning prospects and challenges ahead of us.  Reform measures During the crisis period, a conscious decision was taken to honor all debt obligations without seeking rescheduling and several steps, including some unconventional ones, like pledging gold with international institutions, were resorted to tide over the crisis. The immediate steps undertaken included, among others, tightening of non-essential imports and availing credit from the IMF and other multilateral and bilateral donors. A macroeconomic structural and stabilization programme encompassing trade, industry, foreign investment, exchange rate, public finance and the financial sector was put in place creating an environment conducive for the expansion of trade and investment. It was recognized that trade policies, exchange rate policies and industrial policies should form part of an integrated policy framework if the 2 BIS Review 102/2007 
aim was to improve the overall productivity, competitiveness and efficiency of the economic system, in general, and the external sector, in particular.  Features of economic reforms  It may be interesting to enumerate here some of the important features of the economic reform process undertaken by India since 1991. First, the approach towards reforms in India has been cautious with appropriate sequencing of measures, complementary reforms across sectors (e.g., monetary, fiscal and external sector), and development of financial institutions and markets. The objective has been to progress with some harmony across sectors. Second, the pace and sequencing of liberalization has been responsive to domestic developments, especially in the monetary and financial sectors, and the evolving international financial architecture. The reforms were debated intensely and designed essentially indigenously. Third, the approach to reform was “gradual but steady” rather than a “big bang” approach. The reforms have generally been viewed as a process and not as an event. In this approach, the pace and sequencing of liberalization could be tempered keeping in view the degree of comfort in moving forward in a credible way.  Fourth, the major thrust driving the reform process was the quest for higher growth and efficiency along with macroeconomic stability. At the same time, the reforms had to be “inclusive” in the sense that the benefits of reforms are to be demonstrably shared by all sections, in particular, the vulnerable sections. This has easily been a very significant electoral issue in both provincial and national elections.  III.  Select economic indicators The major macroeconomic indicators for the last seven years are given in the Table 2 (attached) which broadly summarizes the quantitative achievements. GDP growth Over the last four years during 2003-07, the Indian economy has entered a high-growth phase, with the GDP growth averaging 8.6 per cent per annum. The acceleration of growth during this period has been accompanied by a significant moderation in volatility, especially in industry and services sectors. The structure of domestic output has distinctly shifted in favor of the services sector, while growth in industry is also accelerating. Indian industry appears to have responded well to global competition through restructuring and technological upgradation in recent years. India's growth is mainly driven by domestic consumption, which contributed, on an average, to almost two-thirds of the overall demand.  Saving and investment balances A noteworthy feature of the ongoing structural transformation of the Indian economy is the significant increase in domestic saving and investment rates. Domestic investment rate increased from 24.3 per cent in 2000-01 to 33.8 per cent in 2005-06 and domestic saving rate from 23.7 per cent in 2000-01 to 32.4 per cent during 2005-06. The household sector continued to be the major contributor to gross domestic saving with its saving rate placed at 22.3 per cent in 2005-06, while on account of rise in profit, the saving rate of private corporate sector rose to 8.1 per cent in 2005-06. The public sector, which started posting positive saving beginning 2003-04, recorded a saving rate of 2.0 per cent in 2005-06 on account of continuing fiscal improvement as against a negative saving rate of 1.7 per cent in 2000-01. It may be noted that over 95 per cent of investment is financed by domestic BIS Review 102/2007 3 
savings. Given the fact that Indian per capita income is increasing rapidly and policy efforts towards financial deepening for achieving a more inclusive growth are underway, savings rate in India could even rise further in the medium to long term. The level of saving rates should help continue to finance the investment needs of the economy domestically, without undue dependence on foreign savings. Productivity and efficiency In tandem with acceleration in the rate of investment in the economy, there has been evidence of a pickup in productivity and efficiency of capital use. Some of the recent studies relating to India have indicated an increase in total factor productivity (TFP) growth in recent years. For instance, Rodrick and Subramanian, in an IMF working paper of 2004, point out that India seems to have a large amount of productivity growth from relatively modest reforms. A more recent paper by Barry Bosworth, Susan Collins, and Arvind Virmani (2007) confirms this trend. They find that output per worker grew only 1.3 per cent annually during 1960-1980, when GDP growth was also at a low of 3.4 per cent. TFP growth was barely above zero, according to their calculations, indicating that growth in output was almost entirely driven by growth in inputs. In contrast, growth in output per worker nearly tripled to 3.8 per cent during 1980-2004, while TFP increased ten-fold to 2 per cent. The evidence of an increase in the growth of labour productivity is also available from other studies (Economic Intelligence Unit, 2007). A Study by Tata Services (2003) found that for the all-India manufacturing sector, labour productivity (output per unit of labour) has increased significantly during the post-reform period, compared with the pre-reform period.  Poverty and employment  The sustained economic growth since the early 1990s has also been associated with some reduction in poverty. Based on uniform recall period consumption distribution, the proportion of people living below the poverty line declined from 36 per cent in 1993-94 to 27.8 per cent in 2004-05. There is also evidence of pick-up in employment growth from 1.57 per cent per annum (1993-94 to 1999-2000) to 2.48 per cent per annum (1999-2000 to 2004-05). According to some reports and other anecdotal evidence, the benefits of recent surge in growth rate of GDP are not just restricted to large cities, but people in other urban and semi urban areas are also gaining. There is some evidence of reduction in under employment and disguised unemployment in the informal sector.  Money, prices and credit The high growth in GDP in recent years has been accompanied by some moderation of inflation to an average of 4.9 per cent during 2003-07. Historically, India has not seen very high inflation. The headline inflation rate, in terms of the wholesale price index, has declined from an average of 8.2 per cent during the period 1980-81 to 1990-91 to 6.2 per cent during the post crisis period, i.e., 1992-93 to 2006-07, with a sharper moderation in the recent period.  During 2006-07, money supply (M3) increased by 21.3 per cent on a year-on-year basis and was well above indicative projections for the year. It largely reflected the surge in capital flows in the country. Non-food credit extended by the scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) increased by 28.4 per cent during 2006-07 on top of 31.8 per cent in the previous year. The growth of bank credit has favoured retail lending, particularly housing, real estate, trade, transport and professional services and non-banking financial companies – sectors which hitherto were not significant in the credit market. These developments led to a lively debate on the signs of overheating in the economy but subsequent moderation in inflation has diffused the attention. 4 BIS Review 102/2007 
IV.  Monetary policy and regulatory framework As regards the framework of monetary policy, the basic objectives of monetary policy, namely price stability and ensuring credit flow to support growth, have remained unchanged in India. Of late, considerations of macroeconomic and financial stability have assumed an added importance in view of increasing openness of the Indian economy.  In India, broad money (M3) emerged as an intermediate target from the mid-1980s based on the premise of a stable relationship between money, output and prices. In the late 1990s, in view of ongoing financial openness and increasing evidence of changes in underlying transmission mechanism with interest rates and exchange rates gaining in importance vis-à-vis quantity variables, the Reserve Bank adopted a multiple indicator approach in April 1998 whereby interest rates or rates of return in different financial markets along with such data as on currency, credit, trade, capital flows, fiscal position, inflation, exchange rate etc. are juxtaposed with the output data for drawing policy perspectives. The liquidity management in the system is carried out through open market operations (OMO) in the form of outright purchases/sales of government securities and daily reverse repo and repo operations under a Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) and this has emerged as the main instrument for interest rate signalling in the Indian economy. In the context of large capital flows and sterilisation, the availability of policy instruments to manage liquidity has been strengthened further with open market operations through Market Stabilisation Scheme.  While the preferred instruments are indirect, and varied, there has been no hesitation in taking recourse to direct instruments also, if circumstances warrant them. In fact, complex situations do warrant dynamics of different combinations of direct and indirect instruments, in multiple forms, to suit the conditions – especially the transmission mechanism. Similarly, while there is considerable merit in maintaining distinction between monetary and prudential policies of the central bank, the Reserve Bank did not hesitate to enhance the provisioning requirements and risk weights for select categories of banking assets, namely real estate, housing, consumer finance and capital market exposures. There has also been close monitoring of off-balance sheet exposures of banks. Detailed guidelines have been issued, for consultation, on product, accounting and prudential aspects of credit derivatives. A framework for governing banks’ linkages with systemically important deposit taking and non-deposit taking non banking financial companies has also been put in place. More generally, Reserve Bank’s approach has been to recognise the positive contributions that financial innovations make to enhance efficiency of financial intermediation. At the same time, Reserve Bank considers, in a dynamic setting, appropriate safeguards to ensure stability, taking account of the prevailing governance standards, risk management systems and incentive frameworks in the foreign, public, private and cooperative banks as also related non-banks. Overall, these progressive but cautious policies have contributed to both efficiency and stability of the financial system and enables current growth momentum in an environment of macro stability. Some of the important factors that shaped the changes in monetary policy framework and operating procedures in India during the 1990s were the delinking of budget deficit from its automatic monetization by the Reserve Bank, deregulation of interest rates, and development of the financial markets with reduced segmentation through better linkages and development of appropriate trading, payments and settlement systems along with technological infrastructure. With the enactment of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act in 2003, the Reserve Bank has withdrawn from participating in the primary issues of Central Government securities with effect from April 2006. The recent legislative amendments enable a flexible use of the cash reserve and statutory liquidity requirements for banks, without being constrained by a statutory floor or ceiling on the levels of such prescriptions by the Reserve Bank.  BIS Review 102/2007 5 
V.  Fiscal policy reforms and public debt management: centre and States The fiscal system prevalent in the beginning of the 1990s was characterised by a sustained high fiscal deficit and mounting debt accumulation giving rise to inflation, financial repression, and overall deterioration in the macroeconomic fundamentals of the economy. The average gross fiscal deficit of the central government as per cent to GDP during the decade of 1980s was 6.8 per cent as against 3.8 per cent in the 1970s. A positive outcome in recent years is the marked improvement in the health of Government finances with the adoption of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, 2003 by the Central Government and Fiscal Responsibility Legislation (FRLs) by several State governments. RBI and States Under India’s federal system of government, the Constitution allocates the revenue powers and expenditure functions between the Central and State Governments. In general, the functions required to maintain macroeconomic stability and international relations are assigned to the Centre, while provision of public services such as law and order, internal security, public health, sanitation, water supply and agriculture is largely entrusted to the States. Both government layers share responsibility for education, health and infrastructure, though States have a critical role.  In India, borrowing by the State governments is subordinated to prior approval by the national government. This is embodied in Article 293 of the Indian Constitution, under which, any State Government that is indebted to the Central Government, requires prior approval for borrowings. Central approval is embedded in the procedure for sale of State Government securities, and therefore, cannot be violated. Furthermore, State Governments are not permitted to borrow externally, unlike the Centre.  The Reserve Bank plays two crucial roles in relation to the Indian fiscal system, namely as the banker to and the debt manager of both Central and State Governments. The RBI Act allows the RBI by agreement with a State Government to undertake its banking operations and management of its public debt. While undertaking the role of banker for both the Central and State governments, the RBI also provides temporary support to tide over mismatches in their receipts and payments in the form of Ways and Means Advances (WMA).  The Reserve Bank has been organizing a biannual Conference of State Finance Secretaries since November 1997. This Conference, right from its inception, has provided a very useful forum for interaction among all the stakeholders (State Governments, Central Government and the Reserve Bank) on matters related to State finances and arriving at consensual solutions for issues of policy and operational significance. Among the areas that were deliberated, the more important one’s relate to fiscal responsibility legislations at State levels; standardisation of budgetary, accounting and transparency practices; cash management; management of Consolidated Sinking Fund and Natural Calamities Fund; evaluation of fiscal guarantees etc. The Reserve Bank is proactive and responds from time to time, to the needs of States, as evident from two recent moves. Faced with accumulation of large surplus cash balances and a negative spread earned on the investment of such balances, some State Governments had approached the Reserve Bank to arrange for the buy-back of their outstanding State Development Loans (SDLs). Accordingly, the Reserve Bank formulated a general scheme for the buy-back of SDLs with the concurrence of the Government of India. Following the recommendations of the Twelfth Finance Commission, external loans would be passed on to the States (in rupee terms) on a back-to-back basis. Consequently, the State Governments would now have to bear the foreign exchange risk in the context of such loans. Again, at the behest of the State Governments, the Reserve Bank recently organized a workshop on the management of foreign exchange risk, for the benefit of State Government officials. 6 BIS Review 102/2007 
The Reserve Bank interacts with States on several other fronts especially in regard to lending to agriculture, small industries, weaker sections, depositor protection, financial inclusion, financial literacy, responding to natural calamities etc. mainly through the regional offices. Management of public debt The aggregate stock of public debt of the Centre and States as a percentage of GDP is high, currently at around seventy five per cent. There are, however, several unique features of management of public debt in India, which are noteworthy. First, States have no direct exposure to external debt. Second, almost the whole of public debt is local currency denominated and held almost wholly by residents. Third, public debt, of both Centre and States is actively and prudently managed by the Reserve Bank of India ensuring comfort to financial markets without any undue volatility. Fourth, the government securities market has developed significantly in recent years in terms of turnover, depth and participants, and significant further improvements are underway. Fifth, contractual savings supplement marketable debt in financing deficits. Finally, direct monetary financing of primary issues of debt has been discontinued since April 2006. Hence, the high stock of public debt relative to GDP has not so far been a matter of concern as far as stability is concerned, while it is recognised that long term sustainability would call for a gradual reduction to prudent levels.  VI.  External sector reforms Benefiting from a calibrated and sequenced strategy of liberalisation, India’s external sector has become more resilient. Exports have been growing at an average rate of around 25 per cent during the last three years, while imports have grown by around 35 per cent during the same period. The current account remained in surplus during 2001-02 to 2003-04, before turning into a modest deficit since then. There was a significant strengthening in the capital account resulting in continued accretion to the foreign exchange reserves, which was around US$ 228.8 billion as on August 31, 2007. As could be seen from the table 2, there has been considerable improvement in liquidity and sustainability indicators of external debt.  The exchange rate of rupee became market determined from March 1, 1993 and by August 1994 India became current account convertible by accepting Article VIII of the Articles of Agreement of the IMF. There was simultaneously a significant rationalization of the tariff structure in a gradual manner providing opportunity for domestic industry to equip itself to face global competition. For instance, the customs duty on non-agricultural products has come down from 150 per cent in 1991-92 to 10.0 per cent in 2007-08. A qualitative change was brought about in the legal framework for liberalization by the enactment of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) in June 2000. With this, the objectives of regulation have been redefined as facilitating trade and payments as well as orderly development and functioning of foreign exchange market in India.  The extent and timing of capital account liberalization is properly sequenced with other concomitant developments such as strengthening of banking sector, fiscal consolidation, market development and integration, trade liberalization, and the changing domestic and external economic environments. It is also recognized that there may be links between the current and capital accounts and hence procedures are in place to avoid capital flows in the guise of current account transactions. Further, a hierarchy is established in the sources and types of capital flows. The priority has been to liberalize inflows relative to outflows, but all outflows associated with inflows have been totally freed. Among the types of inflows, foreign direct investment is preferred for stability while excessive short-term external debt is eschewed. A differentiation is made between corporates, individuals, and banks. Operationally, the process of managing the capital account consists of operating two routes, BIS Review 102/2007 7 
namely automatic and non-automatic. Consistent rebalancing in the desired direction is done by expanding the automatic route and by moving most of the prohibited transactions to the non-automatic but approval route and at a later stage, to an automatic or deregulated regime. There has been a significant liberalisation of the policy framework with regard to capital outflows over the past few years. Each country has to design its policy regime for capital outflows keeping in view the specific country context, especially characteristics of the real sector, and not merely the contextual level of inflows and extant absorptive capacity of the economy. First, the current regime of outflows in India is characterised by liberal but not incentivised framework for corporates to invest in the real economy outside India, including through the acquisition route. The regime has served the country well since Indian corporates are increasingly able to establish synergies with overseas units, to make up for lack of scale that has been a legacy problem in India, and to quickly acquire domain knowledge through acquisition. Second, significant liberalisation of outflows by individual households has been implemented following recommendation of the Committee on Fuller Capital Account Convertibility (Chairman: Shri S. S. Tarapore, 2006). Further liberalization here would be done in the light of some international experience which shows that resident individuals often precede overseas investors in initiating outflows when the perceptions in regard to domestic economy’s performance or stability appear to turn adverse. Third, as regards the regime for outflows through financial intermediaries, the approach is characterised by caution and quantitative stipulations whereby both prudential considerations and compulsions of management of capital account are relevant.  VII.  Financial sector reforms Major policy measures in the financial sector relate to phased reductions in statutory pre-emption like cash reserve ratio and statutory liquidity requirements and deregulation of interest rates on deposits and lending, except for a select segment. The diversification of ownership of banking institutions is yet another feature which has enabled private shareholding in the public sector banks, through listing on the stock exchanges, arising from dilution of the Government ownership.  The banking sector reform combines a comprehensive reorientation of competition, regulation and ownership in a non-disruptive and cost-effective manner. Indeed our banking reform is a good illustration of the dynamism of the public sector in managing the overhang problems and the pragmatism of public policy in enabling the domestic and foreign private sectors to compete and expand. The regulatory framework in India, in addition to prescribing prudential guidelines and encouraging market discipline, is increasingly focusing on ensuring good governance through “fit and proper” owners and directors of banks. The Reserve Bank has issues detailed guidelines on ownership and governance in private sector banks emphasizing diversified ownership. The Reserve Bank has also provided a significant thrust to implementation of information technology in the banking sector. Foreign direct investment in the private sector banks is now allowed up to 74 per cent, subject to the prescribed guidelines. Again, 100 per cent foreign direct investment is allowed in 19 activities under the automatic route in Non-Bank Financial Companies (NBFCs). There are minimum capitalisation norms for such investments. Besides, 100 per cent NBFC subsidiary can also be established subject to clearance by Foreign Investments Promotion Board (FIPB), Government of India. There has been noticeable increase in the interest of foreign entities to acquire stakes in NBFCs. Policy initiatives have been taken in recent past to ensure that such NBFCs adhere to regulatory prescriptions spelt out for them. In the cooperative segment, the urban cooperative banks (UCBs) had been suffering from the problem of multiple supervisory/regulatory authorities, as also the challenge of reconciling the democratic character with financial discipline. Therefore, several structural, legislative and regulatory measures have been initiated in recent years for urban co-8 BIS Review 102/2007 
operative banks with a view to evolving a policy framework oriented towards revival and healthy growth of the sector. A vision document for their healthy growth has been formulated. Restructuring of the larger weak banks has commenced and is well under way. Similarly, issues relating to rural co-operative banking structures and regional rural banks (RRBs) have been considered actively and comprehensive measures have been planned and some of them are under implementation.  Financial markets reforms Financial markets in India in the period before the early 1990s were marked by administered interest rates, quantitative ceilings, statutory pre-emptions, captive market for government securities, excessive reliance on central bank financing of fiscal deficit, pegged exchange rate, and current and capital account restrictions. A wide range of regulatory and institutional reforms were introduced in a planned manner over a period to improve the efficiency of financial markets. These included development of market micro structure, removal of structural bottlenecks, introduction/ diversification of new players/instruments, free pricing of financial assets, relaxation of quantitative restrictions, better regulatory systems, introduction of new technology, improvement in trading infrastructure, clearing and settlement practices and greater transparency. Reforms in financial markets were carefully sequenced ensuring that they were in sync with the real sector. The reforms were also important for developing the environment for effective monetary policy making and monetary transmission mechanisms. A noteworthy feature is that the government securities and corporate debt market is essentially domestically driven since FII and non-resident participation in these markets are limited and subjected to ceilings. The linkage between the money, government securities and forex markets has been established and is growing. The price discovery in the primary market is more credible than before and secondary markets have acquired greater depth and liquidity. The Reserve Bank has also initiated a number of steps – institutional, procedural and operational – for making the payment systems safe, secure and efficient. For efficiency enhancements and risk reduction, usage of the Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) System and other electronic payment mechanisms has been encouraged in a big way.  VIII.  Financial inclusion and customer services The Reserve Bank has undertaken a number of measures with the objective of attracting the financially excluded segment of the population into the structured financial system. The broad approach of the Reserve Bank is aimed at “connecting” people with the banking system. Measures relating to financial inclusion may be summarized as follows: First, banks were advised to make available a basic banking “no-frills” account with nil or minimum balances as well as other charges to ensure outreach of such accounts to vast sections of the population. As there are many regional languages in India, banks are required to make available all printed material used by retail customers in the concerned regional language. Second, banks have also been permitted to utilise the services of non-governmental organizations/self help groups (NGOs/SHGs), micro-finance institutions and other civil society organizations as intermediaries in providing financial and banking services through the use of business facilitator and business correspondent (BC) models.  Third, banks are also entering into agreements with Indian Postal Authorities for using the large and well spread network of post offices as business correspondents, thereby increasing their outreach and leveraging on the postman’s intimate knowledge of the local population and trust reposed in him. Similarly, banks in association with insurance companies, are BIS Review 102/2007 9 
providing innovative insurance policies at affordable cost, covering life disability and health cover. Fourth, the Reserve Bank has been encouraging the use of ICT solutions by banks for enhancing their outreach with the help of their Business Correspondents (BCs). A multilingual website in 13 Indian languages on all matters concerning banking and the common person has been launched by the Reserve Bank on 18 June 2007.  Several initiatives were also undertaken by the Reserve Bank to improve the delivery of customer services by banks. First, the recommendations of the Standing Committee on Procedures and Performance Audit on Public Services set up in November 2003 covering an individual customer's dealing with a bank in the areas of foreign exchange, currency and government transactions, including pension, besides the main relationship as an account holder are being implemented.  Second, in order to bring together all activities relating to customer service in banks and the Reserve Bank of India in a single department, the Reserve Bank of India constituted a new department called “Customer Service Department” on July 1, 2006. The new department has facilitated a sharper focus to customer service issues.  Third, the Banking Ombudsman Scheme, which was introduced in 1995 to provide an expeditious and inexpensive forum to bank customers for resolution of their complaints relating to deficiency in banking services, was last revised in 2006. The Scheme has an enlarged scope now and is applicable to all commercial banks, regional rural banks and scheduled primary cooperative banks. The complainants can file their complaints in any form, including online.  Fourth, recognising an institutional gap in measuring the performance of the banks against codes and standards based on established best practices, RBI set up the Banking Codes and Standards Board of India in 2006. It is an autonomous and independent body, in the nature of a self-regulatory organisation. Banks register themselves with the Board as its members and provide services as per the agreed standards and codes. The Board in turn, monitors and assesses the compliance with codes and standards which the banks have agreed to. The Code of Banks' Commitment to Customers was released on July 1, 2006. The Code covers various aspects of transactions of individuals such as deposit accounts, interest rates, fees and charges, remittances, settlement of claims in respect of deceased account holders, loan products, safety locker, credit cards, guarantees, collection of dues and complaints and grievance redressal. The Reserve Bank has also made it obligatory for banks to display and update, in their offices/branches as also on their websites, the details of various service charges in a prescribed format.  Fifth, as lack of financial education on the part of customers of the bank contribute to rising number of complaints, especially relating to credit card operations, the Reserve Bank is according top priority for financial education which would ensure that the customers of banks take an informed decision. Individual banks have also started taking various steps in this regard such as “financial education posters”, “short films” and websites, etc. IX.  Prospects, challenges and strengths Short term prospects For monetary policy purposes, the Reserve Bank, in its Annual Policy Statement, placed real GDP growth for 2007-08 at around 8.5 per cent, assuming no further escalation in international crude prices and barring domestic or external shocks. The policy preference for the period ahead is strongly in favour of price stability and well-anchored inflation expectations with the endeavour being to contain inflation close to 5.0 per cent in 2007-08 10 BIS Review 102/2007 
and to the range of 4.0–4.5 per cent over the medium-term. For the purpose of monetary policy formulation, the Reserve Bank has projected the rate of money supply (M3) growth at around 17.0-17.5 per cent and non-food credit at 24-25 per cent for 2007-08 in consonance with the outlook on growth and inflation. While retaining the stance of the monetary policy, the Reserve Bank has flagged the importance of financial stability in the first quarter review of the Annual Policy Statement issued on July 31, 2007.  Data on recent developments is broadly in consonance with expectations for 2007-08. According to the Central Statistical Organization, during the first quarter of the financial year 2007-08 (April-June, 2007), the real GDP grew by 9.3 per cent on the back of 9.1 per cent in the last quarter of 2006-07 (January-March, 2007) and 9.6 per cent in the first quarter of the previous year (April-June, 2006). The wholesale price index, on a year to year basis, decreased to 3.79 per cent during the week ended August 25, 2007 as compared with 5.12 per cent a year ago. As on August 17, 2007, the broad money (M3) supply growth was 20.0 per cent on a year-on-year basis almost same as in the previous year. Though buoyant and broad based, there was a decline in non-food credit growth to 23.6 per cent as on August 17, 2007 as compared with 32.8 per cent a year ago. Exports continued its momentum, however, imports rose sharply, which led to widening of trade deficit to US $ 25.7 billion during the first four months of 2007-08 (April-July) as compared with US $ 15.8 billion during the same period of the previous year. Available information indicates continuation of the growth momentum during 2007-08 so far at a strong pace with the impulses of growth getting more broad-based. Steady increases in the rate of gross domestic saving and investment, consumption demand, addition of new capacity as well as more intensive and efficient utilisation/capitalisation of existing capacity are expected to provide support to growth during 2007-08. The recent gains in bringing down inflation and in stabilising inflation expectations should support the current expansionary phase of growth cycle. It is, however, necessary to continuously assess the risks to the inflation outlook emanating from high and volatile international crude prices, the continuing firmness in key food prices and uncertainties surrounding the evolution of demand-supply gaps globally, as well as in India.  Risks from global developments continue to persist, especially in the form of inflationary pressures, re-pricing of risks by financial markets and danger of downturn in some asset classes. Excessive leveraging has enhanced the vulnerability of the global financial system. Large changes in liquidity conditions are obscuring assessment of risks, with attendant uncertainty. Given the flux associated with both financial markets and monetary policy settings globally, India cannot be immune to these developments. The policy challenge for Reserve Bank, now, is to manage the current transition to a higher growth path while containing inflationary pressures and focusing on financial stability. Contextually, we in the Reserve Bank are, therefore, maintaining enhanced vigilance to be able to respond appropriately to the prevailing heightened uncertainties in global financial, as well as, monetary conditions.  Medium term challenges  For a large and diverse economy with low per capita income but undergoing structural transformation in a highly uncertain global environment, challenges for public policy are manifold. I would focus on a few, which we in the Reserve Bank consider to be crucial for enhancing medium term prospects for equitable growth. First, while over 60 per cent of the workforce is dependent on agriculture, the sector accounts for 20 per cent of the GDP. Further, the GDP growth generated from agriculture is only marginally above the rate of growth of the population, which is not adequate to ensure rapid poverty reduction. Volatility in agricultural production has not only implications for overall growth but also, as the experience of 2006-07 amply demonstrated, for maintaining low and stable inflation. Enhanced growth of the agricultural sector is vital for ensuring food BIS Review 102/2007 11 
security, poverty alleviation, price stability, overall inclusive growth and sustainability of growth of the overall economy. Recently, our Honourable Prime Minister announced a major scheme to double the growth rate of agriculture to 4.0 per cent over the 11th Plan period. A time-bound Food Security Mission was also announced to counter rising prices of food products and to ensure visible changes in their availability over three years. Second, the manufacturing sector has recorded robust growth, despite several infrastructure deficiencies. The inadequate availability of modern infrastructure and shortage of skilled manpower are the most critical barriers to the growth of the manufacturing sector. It is essential to augment the existing infrastructure facilities, particularly roads, ports and power, to provide the enabling environment for industry to prosper. The most important issues here are regulatory framework and overall investment climate, which are being addressed by the Government. One other concern has been the cost recovery, which is expected to improve with enlightened public-private partnership.  Third, a salient feature of the fiscal consolidation process in recent years even after accounting for cyclical elements has been significant reduction in the key deficit indicators. Our studies on State finances in the Reserve Bank of India give grounds for optimism in regard to their fiscal health. We recognize two important areas that, if addressed, would result in fiscal empowerment. One is elimination of subsidies, which are inappropriate and not directly targeted to the poor, and elimination of most of the tax exemptions, which are patently distortionary. Moreover, the delivery of essential public services such as education and health to a large section of our population is a major challenge.  Fourth, there is a growing recognition in India that governance reforms are critical to strengthen state capacity and enable it to perform its core functions. The task of improving the institutions of economic governance comprise, among others, many organizations and actions essential for good functioning of markets. It must be recognized that good governance can co-exist only when public sector functions fairly and efficiently, which is achievable by improving and not undermining it. The business community has therefore a vital stake in improving and empowering public institutions. I would like to endorse what Professor Avinash K. Dixit, President-Elect, American Economic Association said in the Second P.R. Brahmananda Memorial Lecture delivered by him in June 2007 in Mumbai. “Finally, I think that the process of designing institutional reforms offers a good opportunity for fruitful collaboration between academic economists and businesspeople. Many academic economists used to dislike or disdain businesspeople and prefer a statist solution to economic problems. This is much less true in western countries these days, but the tendency may be more persistent in India. I hope even they will regard the task of improving the institutions of economic governance in a favorable light, seeing it as a way of constraining the opportunistic behavior of businesspeople. Many of them will also be attracted by the idea of a bottom-up rather than a top-down reform. There is a wealth of academic studies, theoretical and empirical, of the evolution, performance, and limitations of such institutions. Businesspeople have a clear perception of the specific governance needs of their industries. The two can combine their brains and energies to adapt the lessons of these studies to the Indian situations, and contribute to creating a better environment for continued rapid economic progress of the country.” (Dixit, Avinash K., Second P.R. Brahmananda Memorial Lecture, June 2007, Mumbai, pages 17-18)  Strengths  The Indian economy has some inherent strength, both quantifiable and non-quantifiable, which would facilitate in meeting the challenges ahead. I have already mentioned extensively the quantifiable strengths. Apart from these quantifiable strengths, there are certain “not easily quantifiable strengths” which our economy possesses and I would like to mention some of them. First, a vast pool of science and technology graduates and the millions of people who are familiar with English language are sources of strength. The familiarity with 12 BIS Review 102/2007 
multiple languages in India prepares the people to adapt better to multi-cultural situations, making it easier for them to fit into international systems smoothly. Second, India also enjoys the distinction of being the biggest democracy of the world. The existence of a free press provides some insurance against excesses and makes Governments at all levels more accountable than otherwise. Third, impressive are the initiatives of many States for empowerment of women which defend their rights and help to gain greater self-esteem and control over their own personal lives and social relationships. Fourth, the political climate is characterised by what may be termed as political system stability, despite the coalition cabinets and periodic elections both at the Centre and in several States. Fifth, India will remain one of the youngest countries in the world in the next few decades. This "demographic dividend" is seen as an inevitable advantage provided prerequisites such as skill-upgradation and sound governance to realize it are put in place. Sixth, in terms of business environment, the impressive growth coupled with market orientation of the economy has been a bottom-up exercise, with a very broad-based growing entrepreneurial class. These tendencies are perhaps reflective of a penchant for innovation among already large and growing entrepreneurial class in India, imbued with professionalism and seeking to be globally competitive. Thank you.    BIS Review 102/2007 13

Fatos Ibrahimi: The banking system situation and the future challenges Address by Mr Fatos Ibrahimi, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Albania, at the European Finance Convention, Tirana, 14-15 September 2007. *      *      * Dear participants, It is a pleasure to participate in this summit and to outline some of the main developments in one of the key areas of the Albanian economy, that of the banking system.  In my following discussion, I will dwell on two main issues: First, the key steps in the banking reforms, with special focus on the issues related to commercial banks and the system’s financial developments in the recent years. Second, the aspirations of the Albanian economy to absorb foreign direct investments, their importance to our financial system and the FDI growth implications in the future.  1) The performance of the Albanian banking system Reform in banking was part of the structural reforms undertaken by the Albanian authorities after 1992. In addition to the macroeconomic stability, these reforms aimed to transform the Albanian economy into a market economy, through its privatization and the establishment of financial institutions and institutions of social protection.  Albania has been going through a constant process of banking system consolidation since the transition into a market economy. In most of the 90s, this process was relatively sluggish as a result of the informal financial markets which had held the country’s economic and financial development back. The high interest rates offered by these markets kept the efficiency of monetary policy in steering the interest rate pending. In addition, other issues, such as the high concentration of deposits and loans in three state-owned banks, their operational losses as a result of the increase in non-performing loans’ portfolio, the undeveloped and incoherent regulatory framework in supervision had become an impediment to the expansion of reforms in the banking sector.  Following this period, the banking system consolidation process began to progress. This period is characterized by the reduction in the share of state-owned banks, their gradual privatization and the considerable increase in the number of private banks from 4 operating in 1997 to 17 banks in 2006. In this context, the central bank has been extremely prudent in selecting and licensing the private banks, where only three of them licensed the recent years are of entirely Albanian capital.  Despite the increase in the number of domestic commercial banks, the expansion of the banking activity until 2003 was a prudent one, being in line with the country’s economic development. During 1998-2003, the banking system’s total assets grew by an average of 13 per cent a year, consistent with the nominal GDP growth during this period. Nonetheless, there has been a swift growth in banking assets by 67 per cent in the last three years, which is 2-3 times higher than the cumulative growth of nominal GDP. As a result of the enhanced confidence in the domestic banking system, the share of assets to the GDP increased in 2006 to the peak level of 70 per cent, which is comparable to that of the Central and East-European countries.  The performance of commercial loan to private sector and to households is also satisfactory. Its growth rate has been constantly exceeding the expansion rate of banking assets. Over the last years, private loan has improved considerably; for 2005-2006 it recorded a cumulative growth of 175 per cent, which is the highest growth recorded in the region and the BIS Review 102/2007 1 
Central and East-European countries. Another characteristic in support of foreign crediting institutions is the free choice of currency, where almost 3/4 (three-fourth) of total loan was extended in foreign currency.  Thus far we may say that credit supply is in prudent levels, since non-performing loans’ portfolio, though increased moderately to 3.1 per cent of gross loans in 2006, provides evidence for a limited exposure of the banking sector to non-settlement risk. However, despite the considerable improvement in the assets quality and the commercial banks’ financial performance, the growth of lending to the private sector and to households remains low as a share to the GDP – about 21.3 per cent in 2006, compared to 49 per cent in Central and East-European countries – providing evidence for other non-utilized banking services capacities in the Albanian economy.  2) Banking law Many amendments to the law on the financial system have been made over these years. These amendments resulted from the need of adopting the European Directives in this area and the Basel core principles for an effective banking supervision. This process was successfully finalized upon the approval of Law No. 9662 “On Banks in the Republic of Albania” by the Parliament. Compared with the previous law, the new law is more complete and more accurate in some parts of it. It has integrated some new concepts which are in full compliance with the European Directive 83/349 and other important directives. It stipulates changes in the licensing of activities by level of capital, in consolidated supervision, etc. In addition, “risk management”, which previously was provided for in specific regulations, has been now summarized in a specific chapter of this law.  3)  Foreign direct investments and the Albanian financial system Foreign direct investments have been assessed as very important for developing countries, since they have a positive impact on the macroeconomic, technological and institutional performance of recipient countries. The wide experience over the last decades indicates that the presence of the financial FDIs improves the soundness of the domestic financial system, through a better management of portfolio risk and a more efficient allocation of credit funds. In addition, the technological innovations deriving from the FDI inflows affect the enhancement of the banking system competition and efficiency, through the increase in the variety of products and services provided. Despite these positive effects, the presence of foreign banks in the country instigates improvements in the institutional framework, by pushing the application of international accounting, reporting and supervision standards, which does not only help the commercial banks’ decision-making process but also the central bank’s.  Therefore, the FDIs are expected not only to promote the production activity in the country, but also to have a direct and indirect impact on the Albanian financial system. Foreign production companies will directly need financial transfers and services (channel payrolls through the ATMs, POS), which will be executed through the domestic financial system. The international companies investing in the country will make use of commercial banks’ funding sources in order to prevent exchange rate and interest rate risk.  There have been many property-related developments in the Albanian banking system. Since its establishment, the domination of state-owned banks has been reducing and today, foreign commercial banks’ assets account for over 90 per cent of the banking system.  The increase in the number of foreign banks in the system has been also favoured by the fact that such investments have not been penalized in Albania; the requirements for establishing a bank are similar for both domestic and foreign-owned banks. 2 BIS Review 102/2007 
The current ownership is diverse; there are foreign investors from Austria, Italy, Greece, USA, Turkey, Germany, Bulgaria, Malaysia and some Arab countries. Greek banks have been present in the market since 1996; the German and Italian investment has been present for quite a long time as well, while the latter has grown substantially and has become one of the market’s key actors. Austrian investments may be considered as the most dominant ones. Their ownership has resulted from the acquisition of the largest domestic state-owned bank.  The long presence of foreign banks in the Albanian banking system has influenced the establishment of a stable banking system and its stable growth. Despite the financial collapse of 1997 or the panic crisis in 2002, in none of the cases was the system’s performance a source of crisis or instability. Previously, foreign banks were more conservative in terms of expanding their geographical activity; however, the entry of Raiffeisen Bank into the market pushed them to be more active. This fact may be evidenced by the variety of products provided in the market, the growth of lending and the employment of clear strategies to increase or maintain their market share.  However, the economic benefits deriving from the presence of foreign banks have not reached the proper levels yet. The enhancement of the quality of information provided to the public at large and to the central bank, the lowering of the intermediation cost, the further improvement of risk management, and the standardization of the accounting and financial reporting systems are not in the desired levels yet.  Now let us now turn briefly to the possible financial relationship between the Albanian banking system and the production foreign investments flow. Undoubtedly, the positive influence foreign direct investments have on economic growth depends largely on their recipient countries’ circumstances. It requires a substantial level of financial system development as a crucial precondition. A developed financial system improves the efficiency in allocating the resources and it further enhances the country’s capacity to absorb the FDI.  The entry of new investors will orient the concentration of market segments to large-size businesses. Their impact, along with the lending capacity of our banking market, are believed to be the crucial proof for their success in Albania. In more concrete terms, the circumstances in Albania are such that there is an asymmetrical distribution of total assets between banks in the market. The reference is only to banks, since in terms of total assets, the banking system shares more than 90 per cent. Other non-bank financial institutions play a more insignificant role than the commercial banks. As far as the latter is concerned, there are many qualitative banks in the market, whose presence is an attractive factor for absorbing the FDI.  On the other hand, the concentration of assets and banking loans in a few commercial banks bears the risk of creating an oligopolistic environment where only a few banks establish the terms for new loans. Such a situation would increase the investment cost in the public and private sector and in households, as well. Though thus far there have not been any cases of prices manipulation or banks exercising a dominant position in the market, I deem as necessary the promotion and vitalization of other financial market segments in general. This market requires real commitment in the efficient intermediation of financial resources in all its segments. Non-bank financial institutions need to become more active by expanding their activity in the market segments they operate in. With regard to the banking system, the Bank of Albania deems the revitalization of certain institutions, whose activity shares a small part of the banking market, as crucial. These institutions need to become more active, by taking more responsibility consistent with their business plans and they need to find new ways of organization and co-operation between them in order to enhance competition and provide a more symmetrical re-distribution of banking activity in our market. BIS Review 102/2007 3 
4)  The system’s future challenges Some sectors of economy, such as agriculture, continue to be credited at low levels or are not credited at all. The contribution of banking loans to production investments is still low. Moreover, considering the high share of loans for commercial purposes, it may be concluded that the largest share of loans is used to finance imports. The level of public accessing the banking system is not in the parameters set in the country’s economic development objectives. Furthermore, the level of cash in economy is extremely high. All these phenomena push the borders of informality further and reduce the monetary policy efficiency. It is the financial system’s duty and responsibility to make all its efforts in co-operation with the Bank of Albania and other Government authorities to find the solution to these problems.  In conclusion I would like to say that as a result of the reforms undertaken, the Albanian banking system, being the most dynamic part of the financial system, has made significant progress during the last years. This progress results from the clear visions and seriousness shown by the Albanian authorities in reforming the banking sector, the fruitful co-operation these authorities have had with the international financial institutions such as the IMF and the World Bank for designing medium-term strategies and developing this sector further. This progress is also a result of the numerous challenges the Albanian banking system has been faced with over the recent years.  It may be concluded that the Albanian banking system is presented safe, sound, under a constant reformation and consolidation process. It is going through a new stage, which will provide to the business and the banking clients modern banking services, aiming to reach the western banks’ standards. ¨ With regard to the aspirations of the Albanian economy and strategies to be employed for its further opening to foreign investors, we believe that these undertakings will have a positive impact on the country’s macroeconomic, technological and institutional area.  The banking system’s stage of development and the FDI flows in economy have mutual influences on each other. Hence, if Albania attracts stable and long-term FDI flows in the following years, their impact on the further development of the financial system will be considerable. Furthermore, the demand for banking products both from domestic and foreign companies will grow. 4 BIS Review 102/2007 
Glenn Stevens: Asia, Australia and financial markets1Address by Mr Glenn Stevens, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to the Asia Society AustralAsia Centre CEO Asia Update luncheon, Sydney, 18 September 2007. *      *      * As you would all be aware, 2007 is the 10th anniversary of the Asian financial crisis. The crisis is usually dated as having begun with the float of the Thai baht in July 1997, though the problems had been building for some time before that. The events of 1997 and 1998 profoundly affected the region’s economic growth. In a speech earlier this year, I reviewed the key events of the crisis.2 Rather than go over that ground again today in detail, I will address the question of how Asia is coping with the recent distinct change in global financial market conditions, before talking about how the same events are affecting Australia. I want, then, to turn to issues for the future and, in particular, what interests the Asia-Pacific region has in the ongoing efforts to renovate the post-war official architecture of the international financial system.  Recent financial events For a number of years now, many commentators have expressed concerns about the under pricing of risk in financial markets, with investors increasingly willing to purchase risky assets at high prices and often with considerable leverage. Easy credit conditions accommodated and encouraged these trends. Over the past couple of months, we have witnessed something of a reversal. The initial trigger was the deterioration in the US sub-prime mortgage sector, itself a result of declining credit standards and a slowing US housing market. Since the exposures to these risks had been spread via securitisation into global financial markets, losses are being borne in most parts of the world, including in Australia and some countries in Asia. Those losses have been coming to light only slowly, however, in part because the complex and opaque nature of some of the financial instruments in use makes valuation difficult, or even impossible under adverse conditions. In some cases, there simply is no market for, and hence no way of providing an objective valuation of, the claims in question. In the ensuing climate of uncertainty, investors rapidly have become quite risk averse, and some parts of the global capital market have suffered severe dislocation. In turn, institutions that rely heavily on wholesale capital markets, either for balance sheet funding or to securitise assets they have originated, have experienced difficulties. So-called conduits, credit arbitrage funds and various other vehicles often issued short-term commercial paper to fund their assets. This strategy, which was in some cases designed to avoid capital requirements for loans held on banks’ balance sheets, can carry significant maturity mismatch and hence funding risk. When investor attitudes changed abruptly in early August, asset-backed commercial paper markets around the world virtually came to a standstill, forcing many of these vehicles to tap lines of credit they had with banks. This, of course, transferred the funding pressures to the banks. Since there is a great deal of uncertainty about the likely demand on their own liquidity, banks have been conserving liquidity and have been reluctant to commit to lending to others for anything beyond a very                                                  1  I thank Vanessa Rayner for assistance in preparing this address. 2  See “The Asian Crisis: A Retrospective”, address to The Anika Foundation, 18 July 2007. Available at http://www.rba.gov.au/Speeches/2007/index.html. BIS Review 101/2007 1 
short horizon. Institutional investors, which are now in a much more powerful position than a few months ago, have behaved cautiously and are demanding higher yields to accept bank paper. Hence, short-term funding rates have moved higher in a number of countries. In some cases, even overnight rates spiked sharply higher.  Changes in attitude to risk also spilled over to other markets. The difficulties have spread beyond sub-prime mortgages per se to include the broader range of instruments euphemistically labelled “structured products”. As investors have looked for more secure and liquid assets, yields on government securities have declined, share prices have fallen and there has been some significant readjustment of exchange rates. Volatility across a range of markets has increased significantly.  So risk is being re-priced, and strategies that looked like easy ways of making money in good times are being tested. The episode is also a reminder of the key role still played by the core banking system, despite the growth of capital markets. Banks were the first line of liquidity support when capital markets stumbled. For the time being at least, more of the flow of new credit needs to be done on, and to remain on, the balance sheets of the core intermediaries than has typically been the case over recent years. It is helpful, then, that in most countries, those core institutions are profitable and well capitalised, since there may be quite a considerable process of re-intermediation to be undertaken over the months ahead. Effects of recent developments on Asia There are several potential channels through which these events could have an impact on east Asia. Asian investors could be exposed to the underlying problem assets; Asian institutions and markets could be affected by the backwash of liquidity and funding issues in the major markets; and Asian economies could be affected by broader macroeconomic effects. Let’s consider a few of these channels. At this point, disclosed exposures of Asian financial institutions to the US sub-prime mortgage market per se have been limited and look small relative to the total assets of the institutions concerned. Actually, to digress for a moment, for most holders of such exposures, losses should be sufficiently small as not to fatally undermine the solvency of the holder, unless the holder is leveraged. The biggest problem thus far has not been that exposures are large, but that they are not transparent. The sooner they are all on the table, the sooner the uncertainty will be lessened and the sooner market participants can discriminate sensibly among their counterparts. This is not easy to achieve given the pricing issues, but at the moment, there is widespread suspicion in the absence of clear information. It would be very damaging for that lack of information to lead to a lengthy period of severely reduced credit flow to perfectly good borrowers simply because investors cannot tell who is sound and who is not. More information is needed. Against a backdrop of rising global risk aversion and increased demand for liquidity, investors sold off emerging Asian equity holdings in late July, resulting in noticeable falls in share prices. Asian currencies fell. These movements were not especially large, however, compared with numerous others seen over the past couple of decades. 2 BIS Review 101/2007 
Graph 1    Graph 2   Asian sovereign debt spreads to US Treasuries have risen over recent weeks, though by less than the spreads on low-rated American corporate debt. Indeed, the absolute level of sovereign bond yields in Asia has changed little. BIS Review 101/2007 3 
Graph 3   The sharp increases in short-term money market rates in developed countries do not seem, as yet, to have been a widespread feature of emerging Asian markets. There are a couple of reasons for this. Mortgage lending via securitisation plays a relatively small role in most Asian housing finance markets, which means that the region’s banks have not had to fund warehousing of loans.3 This, along with the fact that most banks in east Asia tend to rely less on offshore or wholesale sources of funding than many of their developed country counterparts, means that it is unlikely these banks have been under much additional funding pressure as a result of tighter global credit conditions. In fact, foreign bank claims on the 1997 crisis countries in total, as a ratio to GDP, have declined substantially over the past decade.                                                  3  See Chan, E., M. Davies and J. Gyntelberg (2006), “The role of government-supported housing finance agencies in Asia”, BIS Quarterly Review, December.

Graph 4    The rapid growth that we have witnessed in east Asian equity markets may pose a risk. Despite the Asian region being a net creditor, net private capital inflows have been positive over the past few years, partly reflecting strong equity inflows. If conditions in global financial markets deteriorate further and risk aversion becomes more entrenched, there is always a possibility that equity capital could flow out of the region reasonably quickly. But Asian equity market valuations are generally not that high, with solid corporate earnings keeping P/E ratios down despite the sharp rise in equity prices recorded in recent years. More generally, in my judgement, structural changes and reforms to Asia’s banking and corporate sectors over the past decade leave the region in better shape than it was a decade ago to cope with any potential problems which may occur.4 Bank balance sheets are typically stronger, a result of improvements to the quality of supervisory oversight and risk management practices, and reduced fragmentation and government ownership in the banking sector. A range of indicators also point to a healthier corporate sector in Asia.54 There is also generally more flexibility in exchange rates today. That, combined with the large build-up in foreign exchange reserves, means that capital outflows, were they to occur, could now be handled more effectively than in the past. Of course, the region could still be affected by international events through the trade channel. The ratio of exports to GDP has increased for all Asian countries over the past decade. While it is true that intra-regional trade has expanded a great deal, it remains the case that a considerable part of this activity is ultimately aimed at delivering goods to outside the region. So a major slowdown in the US economy would still be important for east Asia, the more so if the slowdown also extended to Europe. China is growing strongly, which will help the region to expand even in the face of weaker conditions elsewhere. But, the Chinese authorities are trying to slow their own economy to avoid overheating. So, Asian nations will need to assess the overall economic fall-out from the current episode in formulating their own policies.                                                  4  For a discussion of banking systems in east Asia since the crisis, see Turner, P.

BIS Review 101/2007 5 
In summary, the impact of the recent tightening in global credit conditions on Asian financial markets has, so far, been reasonably well contained. In comparison with the extreme volatility experienced in financial markets during the Asian crisis, recent market movements are minor. This is not surprising, really, given that the nature of the shock we are experiencing today is very different from that of a decade ago. In 1997, the epicentre was in Asia, with inability to distinguish between countries resulting in regional contagion. In contrast, the shock we are experiencing today originated in the developed world, with events in the US housing market the catalyst. The relatively lesser degree of international integration of Asian capital markets with the global system has, in this instance, probably been a blessing. It would appear from this analysis that the main risk to most of the east Asian economies lies not so much in the area of direct financial contagion, as in the ordinary macroeconomic impacts of, potentially, a slower US and world economy. Effects of recent events on Australia Australian financial markets are part of the global financial system, and have become progressively more integrated over time. This has had many benefits, not least of which has been improved access to global capital markets for Australian investors and borrowers. By the same token, when there are major events in global markets, Australian markets can expect to be affected. Recent weeks have offered a clear demonstration of that fact. As I noted earlier, international commercial paper markets have had a very difficult time over the past month. For some weeks, outstanding paper was not able to be rolled over, and it was almost impossible for many entities to issue new paper. The same was true for residential mortgage-backed securities. Some Australian entities have been significantly affected by these disruptions. The underlying asset quality in Australia is clearly sound. Loans that could be called “sub-prime” in Australia are about 1 per cent of the stock of total mortgages, compared with around 15 per cent in the US, and arrears rates on these loans are considerably less than those on US sub-prime loans. The securities backing these Australian loans continue to perform. For the housing loan portfolio as a whole, arrears rates remain exceptionally low by global standards; and for securitised loans in particular, arrears rates have been steady, at about 0.4 per cent, for about the past year and a half. But at times like this, investors are often unable, or unwilling, to discriminate between different underlying credit risks. In such a climate, issuers have understandably been cautious about offering new paper because of the likely higher cost involved. In other words, uncertainty on both sides led to a drying up of the flow of funds in capital markets for several weeks. In recent days, there have been some encouraging signs of new credit beginning to flow again. But conditions are still difficult and this may remain the case for a while yet. In the meantime, the same sorts of pressures on term funding costs for financial intermediaries observed elsewhere have been seen in Australia. International interbank rates for three month A$ loans have recently been about 50-60 basis points above the overnight index swap (OIS) rate (a measure of the expected cash rate). The normal margin is around 10 basis points. Bank bill rates in Australia have been as much as 40-50 basis points above OIS, compared with 5-10 basis points normally. These gaps are smaller than seen in other comparable countries but are nonetheless significant.  6 BIS Review 101/2007 
Graph 5    It is important to note that this is not due to a shortage of overnight liquidity. The system is amply supplied and settlement balances are, in fact, much higher than normal. The RBA has supplied as much cash as the market requires for the cash rate to remain at the level set by the Board, and that rate has indeed remained within a couple of basis points of the target throughout.  Other rates are determined, as they always have been, by market conditions based on participants’ expectations about how the cash rate might move as well as term, liquidity and credit premia. Sometimes, as now, those premia have been known to move. It should go without saying that loan rates are decided by the intermediaries making the loans on the basis of their costs, risk assessments and competitive considerations. The RBA does not set these rates, though we can and do take account of how the margin between these rates and the cash rate alters. As markets work to re-price risk and individual participants grapple with uncertainty about their own possible future liquidity needs, lending and borrowing have been kept very short term. The RBA has acted to assist market functioning by extending the pool of acceptable securities for repurchase agreements. The intention of this is to give market players some additional confidence that quality assets can be turned into cash if needed, so they can get on with the job of re-pricing risk. From our point of view, this means accepting a little more private credit risk in our operations, but we have been moving in that direction anyway for years, if for no other reason than that there is no longer a sufficiently large stock of government securities on issue in which we and market participants could transact in volume. Provided the transactions are conducted on proper commercial terms with appropriate margins, we judge these credit risks to be manageable. Helping financial markets to function as they undergo a re-pricing is, of course, one role of a central bank. But it is also important that we do not lose sight of our other role, of making monetary policy in pursuit of sustainable growth with price stability. From that perspective, we observe that funding costs for intermediaries have risen beyond the adjustments associated with the rise in the cash rate on 8 August. Some borrowers are being asked to recognise this higher cost in the rates they pay for their loans, a trend that will continue if the higher funding costs persist. Hence it appears, at this stage at least, that we may well observe a further tightening of financial conditions in the Australian economy in the months ahead. BIS Review 101/2007 7 
In assessing that prospect, the Bank will need to take note of two forces. The first is that, going into this episode, the economy was travelling very strongly, with the outlook for growth and inflation being revised higher over recent months. The data since the August decision to lift the cash rate indicate an economy at least as strong as the Board’s assessment at that time, with few signs of that momentum slowing. The second factor is that the outlook for the US economy has been weakening and will presumably be affected to some extent by the credit market events themselves. It is conceivable that some European economies could be affected as well, given the credit difficulties in those markets. To this extent, global growth, which has continually surprised by its strength in recent years, could, other things equal, turn out to be a bit weaker than expected a few months ago. Given the macroeconomic situation of the Australian economy thus far, some additional restraint would perhaps not be unwelcome. But just how much such restraint will occur as a result of a market tightening in credit conditions is not yet clear. Assessments of how much is warranted could be affected by changes in the international environment as well as by developments in the domestic economy. These are matters the Board will need to grapple with over the period ahead. Asia-Pacific in the international financial system I turn now away from recent events, as absorbing as they are, to offer a few observations about the Asia-Pacific region in the international financial system over the longer run. It is commonly observed that the “centre of gravity” of the global economy is shifting east, away from the Atlantic and towards Asia – which, for this purpose, should be defined to include India. There is naturally a discussion about how best to recognise this greater importance of Asia in the “architecture” of the international system, including in the official institutions. Some initial progress was made in the small increases in quota allocations in the IMF to four emerging countries, two of which were in Asia, late last year. The much harder task of finding agreement for more far-reaching changes over a longer timeframe is now under way. That is very important work. But the point I would like to offer here is the following. In parallel with the efforts to reform governance of the international institutions, there will need to be efforts to find agreement on mandate questions – that is, about what it is we want the IMF and other bodies actually to do, and not do. It will not suffice for Asia (or other regions in the emerging world) to expect more say in how the institutions are governed without being part of a clear consensus as to how they will use that increased influence. What is their vision of the IMF’s role? What are the limits to that role? Those who will ultimately have to cede some of their current influence to accommodate the developing countries will surely be reluctant to do so unless there is clearer mutual understanding on those sorts of questions. Asia must be prepared to contribute to this discussion. This requires meaningful engagement on the key issues such as: • how can different national policies, including exchange rate regimes, be made to co-exist within the international system?  • what are the respective responsibilities of the various nations to foster that compatibility?  • what is the proper role for the IMF and other supra-national bodies, not just as occasional lenders to individual nations, but as custodians of the international system all the time?  8 BIS Review 101/2007 
The recent “review” of the “1977 Exchange Rate Decision” by the IMF is a start on this discussion. It revises an agreed set of words from 30 years ago to form a more up-to-date basis for guidance to IMF members about exchange rate policies, and provides a framework for surveillance by the IMF membership of those policies. This is a good start, but only a start. The key will be the way the surveillance is actually implemented. That is in the hands not just of the IMF’s staff and management but also its membership. The membership from this region will need to be ready to play its part. By this I mean that the countries of Asia will need to be ready to defend their policies robustly, but also to work with others in understanding and mitigating unintended consequences of their policy choices. Asian countries should, of course, expect the same from other regions. It is worth adding that, in other fora, Asian countries have a potentially strong voice if they can coalesce. In the G-20, for example, China, India, Indonesia, Japan and Korea are all at the table, as is Australia. If that group of countries could speak in a united way on issues of key mutual interest, it would be a powerful force in a globally significant group. It is not easy to find a common position, of course, and it will not be possible on some issues. We need only to look to Europe – a continent that has been working at this for a long time – to see how national differences frequently limit collective regional influence. But to the extent that Asian countries can agree on some things, they have the potential to be quite influential. Conclusion Recent events are putting financial systems to the test around the world. For years people have worried about the so-called “global imbalances” leading to trouble because Asian investors might refuse to buy dollars. Others have feared some sort of repeat of the 1997-style “sudden stop” crisis in the emerging world. But, in fact, it has been a domestically generated credit event in the world’s most sophisticated economy, the United States, that has triggered the recent reappraisal of risk. The resulting financial strains have been most acute in the developed, rather than the developing world. This episode may have some time to run. But the sooner the exposures to problem assets are accounted for and disclosed, the sooner markets can get back to pricing risk prudently and providing credit on sensible commercial terms. At present, without enough information, they are operating on an impossibly short timeframe, out of fear of what tomorrow might bring. Asian countries appear, to date, to be weathering the storm fairly well, as is Australia in my view. But the episode reminds us all of the importance of working to improve the resilience of our own domestic financial systems and policy frameworks, and of the task, as yet uncompleted, of building better international arrangements for the future.

Kemal Kozarić: Reflections on ten years of the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina Speech by Mr Kemal Kozarić, Governor of the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina, at the conference on the 10th Anniversary of the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Sarajevo, 13 September 2007. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen, Governors, From those previous presentations, you could hear about all the challenges that the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina faced during the previous 10 years. The new Governing Board and the Management, in the full capacity, have been running this institution for three years now on the same principles, committed to maintain the local currency stability and the price stability, as the most important tasks of the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The transition to the local management was done smoothly, which, to be honest, we actually expected. The Law on the CBBH has defined this state institution as independent and has given us a good base for performing all the set tasks with a professional attitude and experience. The governing structure and all the staff were motivated to have the Central Bank continue to go the way of stability, safety and confidence. The saying that confidence is difficult to gain, but easy to lose, may be the most evident in central banking, so we defined our policies very carefully in order to avoid the possibility of risking our reputation. Applying the currency board principles, we have continued to invest, in a safe and efficient way, the foreign exchange reserves of our Central Bank and today they reach the highest amounts since its establishment (KM 6.4 billion or USD 4.4). The Central Bank of B&H, as a fiscal agent of the state, is in charge of servicing international obligations, and certainly contributes to Bosnia and Herzegovina’s regular and timely servicing of all the taken over liabilities. Our institution as a fiscal agent has provided for Bosnia and Herzegovina to obtain a new credit rating which is currently B2 with a stable outlook. The successful reform of the payment system has set the Central Bank as the owner of RTGS system and gyro clearing, responsible for all the payments in real time in the country.  The creation of Single Transaction Account Registry of all legal and physical entities in Bosnia and Herzegovina is another project which was very significant for all financial sector. The establishing of the Credit Registry of Legal and Physical Entities, which is in the function of commercial banks in respect of making better business decisions, also has a preventive impact on financial stability and decrease of credit growth. By the end of the year, we will also set up the platform for inter-bank market for gyro money and cash, which will have a positive effect on daily liquidity of commercial banks and reduce the costs and increase the safety of cash transport in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Bosnia and Herzegovina is preparing for issuing bonds to regulate the internal debt issue, primarily the issue of old foreign exchange savings. Those would be the first bonds to be issued by the state and the CBBH will participate in the process as a fiscal agent – it will carry out the settlement of securities to be issued by the state. Today, we will sign the agreement on direct payment operations with Serbia and Montenegro, which will influence the reduction of commercial banking payment operations costs in this region.  In the previous period, the cooperation with the institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina, primarily with the Presidency, the Parliament and the Council of Ministers, was at extraordinary level. The independence of the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina, BIS Review 101/2007 1 
institutional, financial, personnel, was respected by all, which helped a lot to this monetary institution to achieve such significant results. The cooperation of the CBBH with international financial institutions, especially with the IMF, the World Bank, the BIS, the EBRD, was at a high level. The USAID was involved in the most significant projects of our institution, by helping, both in material and personnel respect, their successful completion, which we sincerely thank them for. The Eurosystem has just finished the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina needs assessment programme. The purpose of this project is the assessment of the situation in seven areas of operations the Central Bank, with the comparison with the standards of the European System of Central Banks. The programme applies to the functions of the Central Bank related to the coordination of activities of the agencies in charge of licensing and supervision, economic analysis and research, financial stability, internal audit, monetary policy within the currency board arrangement, payment systems and statistics. In the report prepared by the Eurosystem experts, it is stated that «the CBBH is one of the most stable state institutions and has high reputation as a professional, independent and technically efficient organization which has achieved, in the previous 10 years, a significant progress in developing functions assigned to it.» It is our objective to join the European System of Central Banks, when B&H is ready to join the European Union, and – later on – to introduce the EURO as our own currency in accordance with EU Treaty requirements.  I am using the opportunity at this conference, which is attended by Governors and representatives of central banks in the region, to point out a need of a closer cooperation of central banks which could contribute to the economic development of the region. Namely, the common long-term objective of all the countries in the region is the membership in the European Economic and Monetary Union. All the countries are on the same road to the European Union, some of them progress faster and are well ahead of other countries, while others enter a complex process of meeting the criteria and fulfilling the European standards. The Central Bank, as a unique monetary institution with the primary task to preserve the financial stability and price stability in the country, also has a very important role in European integration processes and regional cooperation. Our region has common objectives and trends, therefore it is natural that we share and exchange experiences. The central banks in the region can cooperate in numerous projects which are highly important for the economy of both the country and the region. In the last 10 years we have tried to implement the monetary policy in a responsible and consistent manner and be a pillar for the entire banking sector and their clients. Our goal was to in a transparent way establish the communication with the public by organizing press conferences, through press releases, regular presence in the printed and electronic media, and by issuing bulletins and periodic reports. I am using this opportunity to thank also the representatives of the media for their professional and objective reporting on the activities of the CBBH. I wish to thank also the previous and current Governing Board for their full support in strategic principles of the CBBH, and to all the vice governors for their significant contribution to the achieved results and to all the employees. In the end, as you know, many foreigners have spent certain periods in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Although I appreciate the contribution and engagement of all of them, the fact is that we quickly forget many of them. However, it is sure that the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina will never forget the engagements of Mr. Serge Robert and Mr. Peter Nicholl. I wish to thank Mr. Robert, who, unfortunately, is not here today because of illness and thank you Mr. Nicholl for everything you have done for our institution. Thank you all for making our anniversary even more important with your presence, and I wish the guests from other countries to have a nice time in Sarajevo and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Thank you for your attention! 2 BIS Review 101/2007 
Jean Claude Trichet: Hearing before the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Parliament  Speech by Mr Jean Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, at a hearing before the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Parliament, Brussels, 11 September 2007. *      *      * Madame la Présidente, Mesdames et Messieurs les membres de la Commission Economique et Monétaire,  La crise du marché américain des prêts immobiliers subprime et son impact potentiel sur l’Europe ont suscité beaucoup d’intérêt au cours des dernières semaines. Je souhaiterais tout d’abord vous fournir de plus amples informations sur les interventions de la BCE en réaction à la forte volatilité enregistrée sur les marchés financiers. En second lieu, j’évoquerai brièvement la situation économique et monétaire et reviendrai plus en détail sur les raisons sous-jacentes à nos récentes décisions de taux. Zum Abschluss möchte ich einige vorläufige Schlussfolgerungen aus Sicht der Finanzmarktstabilität ziehen. *** Let me begin by providing you some further information about the recent events in financial markets and the ECB’s interventions. In July and early August, the crisis in the so-called US sub-prime mortgage market intensified and appetite of global investors for risky assets declined. Market volatility increased in all asset classes. Stock prices declined and government bonds benefited from safe-haven investment flows. In this context, several investment funds holding asset-backed securities suspended withdrawals. A number of European banks admitted direct or indirect exposures to the US mortgage market. Yet it is important to remark that the credit losses were not significant enough to materially impact the soundness of core financial institutions.  Initially, the impact was felt in the US dollar money market, where domestic and international banks were raising short-term liquidity in order to cope with the liquidity needs of a number of “special vehicles” or “conduits” that had difficulty to refinance themselves on the commercial paper market. On Thursday morning 9th of August, the tensions also spread to the euro money market. These unprecedented circumstances called for commensurate actions. Therefore, the ECB injected additional liquidity in the money market in order to restore orderly conditions.  Let me briefly describe our operations in more detail. Our first operation was carried out on 9 August and matured the following day. It was a non-regular overnight operation where the ECB provided liquidity to banks at a fixed rate of 4.00 percent, which is the level of our key policy rate. This liquidity was provided through so-called reverse repurchase agreements. These are transactions whereby the ECB purchases a given amount of eligible assets on the understanding that these will be repurchased by the counterparty at a given price the following day. We pre-announced that we would fulfil 100 percent of the bids submitted by banks. This allowed us to gauge the amount of exceptional liquidity needs in the banking system as a whole and to contribute to calming down the overnight money market under these circumstances. As a result of this operation, the calm on the very short-term money markets was restored for the rest of the day.  During the following three business days, the ECB conducted similar overnight liquidity-providing operations through variable rate tenders with a minimum bid rate of 4.00 percent. In the case of variable rate tenders, counterparties are asked to indicate both the desired amount of money and the interest rate at which they wish to obtain it. The Eurosystem then satisfies first the bids with the highest interest rates. The use of a variable rate in these BIS Review 100/2007 1 
subsequent overnight liquidity-providing operations was in line with our usual practice. Thanks to these operations, on each day from 9 to 14 August the ECB provided additional euro liquidity above what is needed by the banking system under normal circumstance. It rolled over a progressively smaller amount on each day, as the rates and amounts bid by banks in our tenders became progressively lower.  On 14 August, the first Tuesday following the start of the tensions in the money market, the ECB resorted to its standard instrument for market operations, namely its one-week main refinancing operation which is usually allotted on Tuesdays. With a view to ensuring orderly conditions in the money markets, the ECB allotted significantly larger amounts of liquidity than it would have under normal circumstances. The same approach was adopted in the subsequent one-week main refinancing operations on 21 and 28 August and 4 September. Thanks to this relatively generous allotment, money market rates with maturities up to one week were brought back to usual levels.  However, tensions remained in money market rates for maturities above one week. In order to support a normalisation in this money market segment, the ECB decided to implement two supplementary longer-term refinancing operations, the first decision being taken on 21 August and the second on 6 September, both with the usual maturity of three months. In preparing and deciding upon the various operations, the Eurosystem remained, as usual, in close contact with other central banks, including in particular, but not exclusively, the Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of England, the Bank of Canada and the Swiss National Bank. These other central banks also took steps, each within the parameters of their own operational framework. When comparing the steps taken by the various central banks, it is important to take account of these differences in operational frameworks. In any case, it is important to stress that the Eurosystem has shown its capacity to react both promptly and effectively to these challenges. I am convinced that, given the circumstances, we did the right thing at the right level at the right time. Monetary policy stance Through these liquidity operations, the ECB fulfilled one of its key responsibilities, namely to ensure an orderly functioning money market. I will now turn to our primary objective, namely that of delivering price stability over the medium term and be credible in the delivery of price stability over the medium and long term. I would like to emphasize that our primary mandate calls for our monetary policy stance to deliver price stability in the medium term. Once the level of interest rates is decided we have the responsibility to ensure the smooth functioning of the segment of the money market that we influence. The two responsibilities are clearly separated and should not be mixed. On 6 September the Governing Council decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The incoming macroeconomic data confirmed that risks to price stability remain on the upside over the medium term, as identified by both our economic and monetary analysis. The incoming macroeconomic data also again confirmed the strong fundamentals of the euro area economy and support a favourable medium-term outlook for real GDP growth. Data on activity in the third quarter – from various confidence surveys and indicator-based estimates – remain overall favourable. The latest data on unemployment indicate improving labour market conditions and the global economic activity is expected to remain robust, as the likely slowdown in the United States is expected to be largely offset by the continued strong growth in emerging markets. This outlook is also reflected in the September 2007 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee average annual real GDP growth in a range between 2.2% and 2.8% in 2007, and between 1.8% and 2.8% in 2008.  The monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons. On the basis of the latest available data, covering the period to the end 2 BIS Review 100/2007 
of July, the underlying rate of monetary and credit expansion remains strong. This is reflected in the rapid growth of the broad monetary aggregate, M3 and the strength of MFI loans to the private sector, which continue to increase at double-digit rates on an annual basis. Against this background, our monetary policy stance is still on the accommodative side with, inter alia, money and credit growth vigorous in the euro area. At the same time, the financial market volatility and reappraisal of risk of recent weeks have led to an increase in uncertainty. Given the current high level of uncertainty, the Governing Council has deemed it appropriate to gather additional information and carefully examine all new data, before drawing further monetary policy conclusions. Accordingly, the Governing Council will monitor very closely all developments. On the basis of our assessment, by acting in a firm and timely manner, we will ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise and that inflation expectations are firmly anchored in line with price stability, which is even more important in the current context of financial market volatility and increased uncertainty. In this respect, the Governing Council will continue to pay great attention to future financial market developments. Financial stability I would like to conclude my introductory remarks by drawing some tentative lessons for financial stability and supervision of this episode.  Let me first qualify how we see the current situation. We are experiencing a market correction with a significant reappraisal of risk, the possibility of which we had been warning about for quite some time. I can recall that in my appearances before you and elsewhere, I had said that we were diagnosing a level of risk appreciation in global financial markets that was signalling an under-appreciation of risks in general. This was illustrated in particular, but not exclusively, by the relatively low level of spreads, the low level of risk premia and the low level of volatility across a wide range of financial markets. In the very first issue of the ECB Financial Stability Review published in December 2004 we had said that a high level of risk appetite was encouraging a search for yield among investors across a wide range of markets and asset classes. This phenomenon went on for several years together with a very significant degree of innovation and creativity in global financial markets which was improving financial efficiency but also creating new sources of risk.  As I just said we are now in a correction phase which can, as frequently observed in such situations, comprehend episodes of hectic behaviour, a high level of market volatility and elements of over-shooting.  We had seen a distinct possibility that the ongoing deterioration of the creditworthiness of borrowers in the US sub-prime mortgage market could be a trigger for more broad-based market correction. We had said this in our Financial Stability Review published as recently as last June. The most important channel for the propagation of the correction turned out to be the maturity mismatch and, therefore, the strains placed on the balance sheets of special purpose vehicles and conduits which had funded medium-term positions in asset backed securities – where sub-prime mortgages were an important element – with short-term financing commercial papers. It was the difficulties these vehicles faced in rolling over their short-term funding which created much of the strains we saw in money markets.  Now, I know that you are particularly interested in the lessons we can draw from the present episode. As we are not yet at the end of it, I would say that at this stage we must be prudent in drawing definitive conclusions. That said, I believe there are a number of areas where we know lessons will have to be drawn by the international community and where orientations for appropriate improvements can be seen.  First, over the past decade, we have experienced a tremendous increase in the sophistication of financial instruments. While the positive effect of these innovations has BIS Review 100/2007 3 
been to allow market participants to better share risk, some negative aspects have clearly been highlighted by the ongoing episode. In particular, the degree of complexity of some products that are designed for the purposes of re-packaging and selling debt instruments has become overwhelming. Although I would be very hesitant to impose limitations on the creativity of market participants in their pursuit of innovation and enhanced efficiency of the financial markets, in my view, instruments and structures that cannot be fully understood even by those who bear the ultimate responsibility of the level of risk taken by financial institutions should not be acquired or set up by banks and investors who are lacking sufficient sophistication in the management of the risks. At the same time, the responsibility of those originating such new products should not be understated either, as the current episode has demonstrated that the underlying assumptions in the pricing models for complex instruments are not always robust to changing financial market conditions. Investment banks have become very active in this area and a part of the dramatic increase in derivatives markets and financial leverage that we have witnessed has been favoured by the underpricing of risk, of which the ECB has repeatedly warned about in the recent past.  Second, much attention has been focused on the role played by rating agencies prior to the current market correction. It is true that the very small number of large global rating agencies is a real issue for the present functioning of global finance. Potential conflicts of interest, where they exist, would have to be dealt with and possible benchmarks for improved behaviour could be worked out. In any case an important lesson of the current risk re-pricing is that investors must never take the opinion of rating agencies as a substitute for their own credit analysis and due diligence.  Third, the current events highlight the importance of further improving financial sector surveillance activity by financial regulators and the risk management practices of financial institutions. The new Basel II capital accord, which is currently being implemented, will bring substantial benefits in this sense. Indeed, Basel II strongly relies on significantly improved risk management in determining the appropriate capital buffers for banks. Despite these improvements, the degree of sophistication of financial markets calls for constant investment in stress-testing practices in order to ensure that banks are aware of the potential losses they might accrue even in highly unlikely scenarios. The Basel Committee for Banking Supervision, where the relevant authorities are represented, is playing a very important role in this field. Another area where progress could and should be made is the area of liquidity. Appropriate harmonisation of the various national rules and requirements appears to be particularly opportune in the light of the recent events. Fourth, we have to continue reflecting on how to deal with all non-regulated entities. The main channels of propagation of the present turbulences have been the non-regulated constituency of so-called conduits and special investment vehicles and not the highly leveraged non-regulated institutions like hedge funds and private equity funds. I would say at this stage that we should implement rapidly what is already crystallized in international consensus on hedge funds, namely the recommendations of the Financial Stability Forum. And we have to improve very substantially our handling of conduits and special vehicles.  Looking forward, some tentative policy implications can be identified from a financial stability perspective. First, we need to restore confidence as we have a paradox that there is a large number of high quality assets which investors are currently treating as if they were not creditworthy. Now, it seems to me that the one important reason why we observe such a lack of confidence is because we do not have sufficient transparency. This is an area that we need to look at very carefully, to see which measures should be taken to improve transparency. Let me remind you that after the Asian crisis we drew that conclusion: the absence of sufficient transparency had driven a number of investors and market participants to consider that each particular issuer in Asia was to be treated with great caution and fear, because they were not sure of the accuracy of the information and data which were displayed. The international community drew the conclusion that it was necessary to increase transparency in particular as regards monetary policy, fiscal policy and the level of 4 BIS Review 100/2007 
reserve assets in these emerging markets. And it worked, in my opinion, pretty efficiently. So again, it is a lesson that we learnt in the past.  I am now at your disposal for questions. BIS Review 100/2007 5 
Amando M Tetangco, Jr: The constellation of monetary challenges and responses Speech by Mr Amando M Tetangco, Jr, Governor of the Central Bank of the Philippines (Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas), at the Philippine Economic Briefing, Makati City, 12 September 2007.  *      *      * I.  The current economic constellation Both the domestic and international business communities affirm that the Philippines is now experiencing the most stable macroeconomic environment in a decade.  The inflation rate has been low and stable, with the outlook for inflation benign. This has allowed monetary authorities to maintain interest rates at low and stable levels also.  Our balance of payments remains in surplus, bolstered by the current account, which is also in surplus, in fact for four (4) consecutive years now. We have built up our international reserves to a record-high of $30.3 billion, adequate to more than cover our short-term liquidity requirements. Our strong external position enabled the BSP and the NG to prepay foreign debts amounting to US$ 2.1 billion in 2006 and another $0.9 billion in the first half of 2007. These have markedly improved our external debt ratios. Included in these payments was the prepayment in full of the country’s outstanding obligations to the IMF in December 2006, a milestone in the Philippines’ relationship with the IMF since it effectively ended the country’s use of IMF resources after nearly four and a half decades.  Our banking system is growing at double digit rates in both asset size and deposit base, improving in profitability and continues to be capitalized well-above international standards.  Investor attention and responses to the current constellation of economic data have been significantly positive as evidenced by the following developments, particularly during the first half of the year:  • The stock market reached seven-year highs  • The peso appreciated on account of strong export earnings and sustained overseas remittances.  • Our sovereign credit spreads compressed.  • Yields on domestic securities fell to record lows.  The questions, however, that may be in your minds now are: Can these gains be sustained? Will the economic momentum be able to weather the recent domestic and global market adjustments and volatilities?  My quick answer is yes.  Our macroeconomic fundamentals are sound. Because our underlying fundamentals are the result of the fiscal, macroeconomic, banking and financial sector reforms that have been undertaken vigorously and continue to be pursued, I believe we are resilient and therefore less vulnerable to domestic and external uncertainties.  II.  The challenges to monetary policy formulation On the part of the BSP, we formulate monetary policy against an assessment of global and domestic economic issues and developments.  BIS Review 100/2007 1 
We are mindful of the range of circumstances in recent times which draws important challenges for Philippine monetary policy. Plentiful global liquidity. The strong foreign exchange inflows into Asia. The build-up of international reserves. The marked appreciation of regional currencies against the US dollar. Financial innovations. Yield-seeking activities of agents, and now more recently, a reassessment of risk appetite and repricing of risks. A possible further tightening of global credit conditions. The fragility of US growth. Volatile oil and commodity prices.  All these challenge us as we endeavor to provide a sound monetary policy environment, while advancing reforms that promote growth and respond to changes in global financial conditions. Our resolve to follow good governance and international best practices in our reform agenda has provided us the discipline necessary to craft appropriate responses and avoid steps that could distort rational market behavior. III.  The courses of action Let me put forward three essentials in response to these challenges. One, we will remain focused on achieving our inflation target. Our monetary policy will continue to be responsive and forward-looking. Our inflation targeting approach has proven to be effective as a monetary anchor and provides us with an array of policy tools against turbulent economic and financial conditions.  Two, we will maintain our market-determined exchange rate policy, while complementing this with a liberalization of our foreign exchange regulations to allow greater access to foreign exchange for outward investments. We have already put out the “first wave” of FX liberalization measures, a “second wave” will be implemented before the end of the year.  Third, we will continue to undertake steps to strengthen the domestic financial system and help manage risks attendant to financial market developments.  In the banking sector, we are focused on good governance, asset-clean up, capital build-up and industry consolidation. We want to see stronger, well-governed, better-capitalized banks that would be effective channels of monetary policy. In other words, stable financial institutions that perform the intermediation function between the sources and users of funds, fully cognizant of the risks attendant to this role.  As driven by the changing profit dynamics brought about by our adoption of international accounting and the Basel II capital adequacy standards, we are encouraging banks to look for ways to capture economies of scale. This would make them more capable of investing in the required technologies (i.e., risk-based technologies) thereby making them more competitive in an increasingly challenging local and global environment.  These and other long-term structural reforms will continue to support a favorable investment climate and enhance productivity through investments in our growth sectors. IV.  The clever response from you We are aware that the core investor is always in search, not just of higher and higher returns, but rather of “quality” returns. We are also aware that countries with good governance frameworks, wide-ranging structural reforms and appropriate macroeconomic policies are always on such investors’ shortlist in their search for high effective returns.  I believe, the Philippines’ macroeconomic fundamentals as well as the reforms that have been instituted in the banking sector make us a clear choice for the core investor.  The recent volatilities related to the US subprime mortgage market are not likely to have a direct significant impact on our banking system. Philippine banks’ exposure to the CDO 2 BIS Review 100/2007 
market is a minuscule 0.2 percent of the total banking system’s assets, none of which have subprime mortgages as underlying assets. Apart from this, sufficient liquidity in the domestic financial system, as well as the increased tapping by corporates of long-term domestic funding for their expansion needs, will help reduce the influence or effects of external developments on our markets. As always, should there be need for more liquidity in the system, the BSP will act to maintain order and stability in the markets. As the country pursues further reforms that support growth and reduce our vulnerabilities to external shocks, I ask investors to focus on our fundamentals. I am confident that this pattern of strong macroeconomic fundamentals will be sustained and favor a constellation of bullish opportunities and expectations for the Philippine economy.

Ben S Bernanke: Global imbalances – recent developments and prospects Remarks by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Bundesbank Lecture, Berlin, 11 September 2007. The original speech, which contains various links to the documents mentioned, can be found on the US Federal Reserve System’s website.  *      *      * In a speech given in March 2005 (Bernanke, 2005), I discussed a number of important and interrelated developments in the global economy, including the substantial expansion of the current account deficit in the United States, the equally impressive rise in the current account surpluses of many emerging-market economies, and a worldwide decline in long-term real interest rates. I argued that these developments could be explained, in part, by the emergence of a global saving glut, driven by the transformation of many emerging-market economies – notably, rapidly growing East Asian economies and oil-producing countries – from net borrowers to large net lenders on international capital markets. Today I will review those developments and provide an update. I will also consider policy implications and prospects for the future.  A principal theme of my earlier remarks was that a satisfying explanation of the developments in the U.S. current account cannot focus on developments within the United States alone. Rather, understanding these developments and evaluating potential policy responses require a global perspective. I will continue to take that perspective in my remarks today and will emphasize in particular how changes in desired saving and investment in any given region, through their effects on global capital flows, may affect saving, investment, and the external balances of other countries around the world. The origins of the global saving glut, 1996-2004 I will begin by reviewing the origins and development of the global saving glut over the period 1996-2004, as discussed in my earlier speech, and will then turn to more-recent developments. As is well known, the U.S. current account deficit expanded sharply in the latter part of the 1990s and the first half of the present decade. In 1996, the U.S. deficit was $125 billion, or 1.6 percent of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP); by 2004, it had grown to $640 billion, or 5.5 percent of GDP.1 National income accounting identities imply that the current account deficit equals the excess of domestic investment in capital goods, including housing, over domestic saving, including the saving of households, firms, and governments. The proximate cause of the increase in the U.S. external deficit was a decline in U.S. saving; between 1996 and 2004, the investment rate in the United States remained almost unchanged at about 19 percent of GDP, whereas the saving rate declined from 16-1/2 percent to slightly less than 14 percent of GDP.2 Domestic investment not funded by domestic saving must be financed by                                                  1  The shift was almost wholly attributable to a similar expansion of the trade deficit. The balance on investment income actually improved over the period.  2  More precisely, investment grew from 19.0 percent to 19.3 percent of GDP, and saving declined from 16.5 percent to 13.8 percent of GDP, for a net change in investment less saving of 3.0 percent of GDP. As implied by data noted earlier in this paragraph, the net change in the U.S. current account deficit over the same period was 3.9 percent of GDP. In principle, the change in the excess of investment over saving and the change in the current account deficit should be the same. The difference between the two figures is accounted for by BIS Review 99/2007 1 
capital flows from abroad, and, indeed, the large increase in the U.S. current account deficit was matched by a similar expansion of net capital inflows. Globally, national current account deficits and surpluses must balance out, as deficit countries can raise funds in international capital markets only to the extent that other (surplus) countries provide those funds. Accordingly, it is not surprising that the widening of the U.S. current account deficit has been associated with increased current account surpluses in the rest of the world.  What is surprising, however, in light of historical patterns, is that much of the increase in current account surpluses during this period took place in developing countries rather than in the industrial countries.3 The table shows current account balances for various countries and regions in selected years. The aggregate current account balance of industrial countries other than the United States did increase between 1996 and 2004, by a bit less than $200 billion, much of that rise being accounted for by an increase in Japan's current account balance; the aggregate balance of the euro area rose only slightly.4 In comparison, the aggregate current account position of developing countries swung from a deficit of about $80 billion in 1996 to a surplus of roughly $300 billion in 2004, a net move toward surplus of $380 billion.  In the aggregate, the shift from deficit to surplus in the current account of the emerging-market world over this period largely reflected increased saving as a share of output rather than a decline in the rate of capital investment. However, changes in saving and investment patterns varied by countries and regions. For example, in the countries of developing Asia excluding China, most of the $150 billion swing toward external surplus between 1996 and 2004 was attributable to declines in domestic investment. In China, rates of both saving and investment rose, but saving rates rose more, leading to an increase in that country's current account surplus of about $60 billion. Outside of developing Asia, oil exporters in the Middle East and the former Soviet Union were also important contributors to the large increase in emerging-market current account balances. The combined current accounts of the two regions increased from a surplus of $20 billion in 1996 to a surplus of $162 billion in 2004, an increase of about $140 billion. This rise largely reflected higher saving rates, as domestic consumption fell behind the surge in oil revenues. Among other emerging-market economies, higher saving also accounted for an increase in the aggregate current account balance of Latin America. Of course, as emerging-market countries switched from being net borrowers to being net lenders, they began to pay down their international debts and to acquire assets of industrial countries.                                                                                                                                                        statistical discrepancies, both within the national income and product accounts (NIPA) and between the balance of payments definitions and NIPA definitions of certain international transactions. 3  I am using the terms "emerging-market" and "developing" interchangeably. 4  As shown in the table, the surplus of industrial countries other than the United States increased from about $150 billion to nearly $350 billion over the period, and the Japanese external balance rose from $66 billion to $172 billion. The increase in the Japanese current account balance as a share of GDP, from 1.4 percent to 3.7 percent, occurred despite a substantial fall in the GDP share of the saving rate, from 30.4 percent to 26.8 percent, as the GDP share of the investment rate fell even more dramatically, from 28.9 percent to 23.0 percent. For the euro area as a whole, the current account balance remained at about 1 percent of GDP between 1996 and 2004, as aggregate investment and saving ratios remained largely unchanged. Within the euro area, Germany's current account balance increased almost 5 percentage points of GDP – from -0.6 percent in 1996 to 4.3 percent in 2004 – as saving moved up and investment decreased. However, this development was offset by declines in the balances of some other euro-area countries, including France, Italy, and Spain; the decreases were mostly associated with higher investment rates. Data on saving, investment, and current account balances for countries other than the United States are drawn primarily from the International Monetary Fund, World Economic Outlook Database, April 2007 (www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2007/01/data/index.aspx); in some cases, data are drawn from national sources. 2 BIS Review 99/2007 
I have noted the expansion of the U.S. current account deficit and the associated increases in current account surpluses abroad over the 1996-2004 period. A third key development in that period was a sustained decline in long-term real interest rates in many parts of the world. For example, the real yield on ten-year inflation-indexed U.S. Treasury securities averaged about 4 percent in 1999 but less than 2 percent in 2004. The difference between the nominal long-term Treasury yield and the trailing twelve-month rate of consumer price inflation, another measure of the U.S. real interest rate, showed a similar pattern, falling from about 3.5 percent in 1996 to about 1.5 percent in 2004. Similar movements were observed in other industrial countries: In the United Kingdom, the real yields on inflation-indexed government bonds fell from an average of 3.6 percent in 1996 to just below 2 percent in 2004; in Canada, the analogous figures were 4.6 percent in 1996 and 2.3 percent in 2004. Real interest rates measured as the difference between government bond yields and consumer inflation also fell in Germany, Sweden, and Switzerland. However, in Japan, real interest rates remained low throughout the period.  In sum, considering the 1996-2004 period, we have three facts to explain: (1) the substantial increase in the U.S. current account deficit, (2) the swing from moderate deficits to large surpluses in emerging-market countries, and (3) the significant decline in long-term real interest rates. Many observers have focused on the expansion of the U.S. current account deficit in isolation and have argued that it is due largely to domestic factors, particularly declines in both public and private saving rates. But accounting identities assure us that any movement in the current account must involve changes in realized saving rates relative to investment rates. The question at issue, therefore, is whether the decline in the realized saving rate in the United States reflected a decline in desired saving or was instead a response to other, possibly external, economic developments. Or, in textbook terms, did the fall in the realized saving rate in the United States reflect a shift in the demand for savings at any given interest rate (a shift in the saving schedule) or a decline in savings induced by a change in the interest rate (a movement along the saving schedule)?  In fact, there is no obvious reason why the desired saving rate in the United States should have fallen precipitously over the 1996-2004 period.5 Indeed, the federal budget deficit, an oft-cited source of the decline in U.S. saving, was actually in surplus during the 1998-2001 period even as the current account deficit was widening. Moreover, a downward shift in the U.S. desired saving rate, all else being equal, should have led to greater pressure on economic resources and thus to increases, not decreases, in real interest rates. As I will discuss later, from a normative viewpoint, we have good reasons to believe that the U.S. saving rate should be higher than it is. Nonetheless, domestic factors alone do not seem to account for the large deterioration in the U.S. external balance. In my earlier speech, I put forth an alternative explanation that is consistent with each of the three basic facts I listed earlier. That explanation takes as a key driving force a large increase in net desired saving (that is, desired saving less desired domestic investment) in emerging-market and oil-producing economies, a change that transformed these countries from modest net demanders to substantial net suppliers of funds to international capital markets. This large increase in the net supply of financial capital from sources outside the industrial countries is what, in my earlier remarks, I called the global saving glut. To interpret the rise in net saving in emerging-market countries as causal, we need to identify factors in those countries that may have caused their desired saving to rise, or their desired                                                  5  During the first part of the period, the rise in U.S. productivity and higher stock prices likely contributed to the U.S. current account deficit by increasing desired investment and reducing desired saving. However, some of the increase in stock prices may have been the endogenous result of factors discussed later, and in any case the effects of the stock market on investment dissipated by 2004. Finally, as noted in the text, if the driving force behind the changes in external balances was a decline in desired saving in the United States, world real interest rates would have risen rather than fallen. BIS Review 99/2007 3 
investment to fall, or both. In fact, several factors appear to have contributed to the increase in the supply of net saving from emerging-market countries. First, the financial crises that hit many Asian economies in the 1990s led to significant declines in investment in those countries (in part because of reduced confidence in domestic financial institutions) and to changes in policies – including a resistance to currency appreciation, the determined accumulation of foreign exchange reserves, and fiscal consolidation – that had the effect of promoting current account surpluses. Second, sharp increases in crude oil prices boosted oil exporters' incomes by more than those countries were able or willing to increase spending, thereby leading to higher saving and current account surpluses. Finally, Chinese saving rates rose rapidly (by more even than investment rates); that rise in saving was, perhaps, a result of the strong growth in incomes in the midst of an underdeveloped financial sector and a weak social safety net that increases the motivation for precautionary saving. The combined effect of these developments, I argued, raised desired saving relative to desired investment in the emerging markets, which in turn led to current account surpluses in those countries. But for the world as a whole, total saving must equal investment, and the sum of national current account balances must be zero. Accordingly, in the industrial economies, realized saving rates had to fall relative to investment, and current account deficits had to emerge as counterparts to the developing countries' surpluses. This adjustment could be achieved only by declines in real interest rates (as well as increases in asset prices), as we observed. The effects were particularly large in the United States, perhaps because high productivity growth and deep capital markets in that country were particularly attractive to foreign capital. The global saving glut hypothesis is thus consistent with the three key facts I noted earlier. To be sure, the global saving glut was not the only factor behind the decline in long-term real interest rates since the 1990s. As I described in subsequent remarks (Bernanke, 2006), term premiums also declined during this period for reasons that are debated but may have included a perceived reduction in uncertainty regarding inflation and the real economy as well as increased demand for longer-term securities by various institutional investors, including pension funds and foreign central banks. Changes in the global pattern of saving and investment surely played an important role in the decline in long-term rates, however. Recent developments I turn now to a review of developments since I last spoke on these issues two and a half years ago. In brief, external imbalances have become wider since 2004. Both the geographical pattern of these imbalances and their sources in terms of saving and investment rates have changed a bit. Nevertheless, the broad configuration that developed after 1996 still seems to be in place today. As the table shows, the U.S. current account deficit has widened further in the past two years, from $640 billion in 2004 (5.5 percent of GDP) to $812 billion in 2006 (6.2 percent of GDP), although it fell a bit in the first quarter of this year, to $770 billion at an annual rate. In an accounting sense, the increase in the U.S. deficit over this period reflects primarily an increase in the investment rate from about 19 percent of GDP in 2004 to 20 percent of GDP in 2006. The U.S. national saving rate did not change significantly over that period. Meanwhile, the aggregate current account surplus of emerging-market economies expanded about $350 billion, from $297 billion in 2004 to $643 billion in 2006; almost all the increase was attributable to a higher aggregate rate of saving. A significant portion of this further growth is due to China, whose current account surplus swelled an additional $180 billion, rising from 3.6 percent of national output in 2004 to 9.4 percent in 2006. The increase in the Chinese surplus can be attributed primarily to an increase in the saving rate between 2004 and 2006. The increase in China's saving rate could, in part, be a consequence of the rapid pace of growth in the country. That is, with income growing very rapidly, but with consumer credit not readily available and precautionary motives for saving remaining strong, 4 BIS Review 99/2007 
consumption is failing to catch up.6 Also contributing to high saving rates was the authorities' decision to limit currency appreciation, thereby restraining import demand and boosting exports. Oil exporters have also contributed significantly to the recent increase in the aggregate current account balance of developing countries. The combined current account balance of the countries of the Middle East and the former Soviet Union (which include a number of large oil exporters) rose about $150 billion between 2004 and 2006. Again, the increase is almost entirely reflected in higher saving rates, as the oil exporters continue to save a large portion of the increased revenue resulting from higher oil prices.  In contrast to the situation in emerging markets, the aggregate current account surplus for industrial countries other than the United States declined recently, from almost $350 billion in 2004 to about $200 billion in 2006; most of the decline reflected a sharp drop in the euro-area balance. Thus, unlike in the 1996-2004 period, industrial countries other than the United States have absorbed part of the increase in the net supply of capital coming from the emerging-market economies. In aggregate, the recent decline in the current account balances of non-U.S. industrial economies reflects an increase in investment rates; saving rates have generally remained little changed.7 In short, in the emerging markets, realized saving and current account surpluses have increased since 2004. In the industrial countries, over the same period, current accounts have moved further into deficit, primarily because of higher realized rates of investment. What about real interest rates? Since I discussed these issues in March 2005, real interest rates have reversed some of their previous declines. For example, in the United States, real yields on inflation-indexed government debt averaged 2.3 percent in 2006 as compared with 1.85 percent in 2004. In the past few weeks, that yield has averaged about 2.4 percent. Inflation-adjusted yields in other industrial countries have also started to move back up after falling in 2005.8  How does this all fit together? My reading of recent developments is that although some of the details have changed, the fundamental elements of the global saving glut remain in place. Most important, the emerging-market countries and oil producers remain large net suppliers of financial capital to global markets. The mix of suppliers of funds and the factors motivating that supply have changed a bit: China and the oil exporters account for a larger share of the developing countries' aggregate surplus, and developing Asia excluding China accounts for somewhat less. Also, the further expansion of the region's net supply of saving in the past two years appears to reflect primarily an increase in desired saving by the emerging-market countries, whereas the previous increase in net saving also involved some decline in desired investment in East Asia after the financial crises of the 1990s. Exchange rate policies in Asia have also influenced desired saving in that region.                                                  6  The combined current account balance of developing Asia excluding China narrowed a bit as a share of GDP between 2004 and 2006, as the investment rate edged up while the saving rate was little changed. Nevertheless, investment rates in this region still remain substantially below their 1996 levels.  7  The combined current account balance for the euro area moved from a surplus of $115 billion in 2004 to a deficit of about $10 billion in 2006, largely because of an increase in the aggregate investment rate. Large declines in the balances of France, Italy, and Spain more than offset a higher surplus in the balance of Germany. For the euro area as a whole, the movement into deficit has largely reflected an increase in the euro-area investment rate from about 20 percent of GDP in 2004 to about 21 percent of GDP in 2006. Japan's current account surplus was almost unchanged at around $170 billion in both 2004 and 2006, as an increase in the rate of investment was matched by a higher saving rate.  8  Inflation-adjusted bonds in the United Kingdom had a yield of 2.19 percent, on average, in July 2007 as compared with a yield of 1.65 percent, on average, in July 2005. In Canada, yields on inflation-adjusted bonds moved from 1.76 percent in July 2005 to 2.18 percent in July 2007. Real interest rates, calculated as government bond yields minus twelve-month inflation rates, have also moved up since 2005 in Germany, Sweden, and Switzerland. BIS Review 99/2007 5 
Further increases in net capital flows from the developing economies, all else being equal, should have further depressed real interest rates around the world. But as I have noted, in the past few years, real interest rates have moved up a bit. This increase does not imply that the global saving glut has dissipated. However, it does suggest that, at the margin, desired investment net of desired saving must have risen in the industrial countries enough to offset any increase in desired saving by emerging-market countries. This characterization is certainly consistent with the pickup in investment rates in the industrial countries, which I noted earlier, and it is also consistent, more generally, with the recovery of domestic demand growth in Europe, Japan, and other parts of the industrial world. In summary, economic growth over the past few years, especially in industrial countries, has apparently been sufficient to increase the net demand for saving and thus to raise global real interest rates somewhat. Once again, however, I do not want to rely exclusively on this line of explanation for the behavior of long-term real interest rates, as other factors have no doubt been relevant. In particular, term premiums appear recently to have risen from what may have been unsustainably low levels, in part because of the greater recent volatility in financial markets and investors' demands for increased compensation for risk-taking. Are current account imbalances a problem? This analysis of the sources of global imbalances does not address the critical normative question: Are the current account imbalances that we see today a problem? Not everyone would agree that they are, for several reasons.  First, these external imbalances are to a significant extent a market phenomenon and, in the case of the U.S. deficit, reflect the attractiveness of both the U.S. economy overall and the depth, liquidity, and legal safeguards associated with its capital markets.9 Of course, some foreign governments have intervened in foreign exchange markets and invested the proceeds in U.S. and other capital markets, which most likely has led to greater imbalances than would otherwise exist. But the supply of capital from foreign governments is not as large as that from foreign private investors. From 1998 through 2001, even as the U.S. current account deficit widened substantially, official capital flows into the United States were quite small. During the years 2002 through 2006, net official capital inflows picked up substantially but still corresponded to less than half (47 percent) of the U.S. current account deficit over the period. On a gross basis, during the same period, private foreign inflows were three times official capital flows.10 Moreover, even public investors are motivated to some extent by the attractions of the U.S. economy and U.S. capital markets.  Second, current account imbalances can help reduce tendencies toward recession, on the one hand, or overheating and inflation, on the other.11 During the late 1990s, for example, the developing Asian economies that had experienced financial crises and consequent collapses in domestic investment benefited from being able to run trade surpluses, which helped strengthen aggregate demand and employment. During that same period, the trade deficits run by the United States allowed domestic demand to grow strongly without creating significant inflationary pressures. Until a few years ago, the euro area was growing slowly                                                  9  An interesting vein of recent research suggests that one of the reasons that developing countries seek to run current account surpluses is to finance the acquisition of high-quality assets they cannot produce in their own economies. Refer to Caballero, Farhi, and Gourinchas (2006) and Mendoza, Quadrini, and Rios-Rull (2007). 10  During 2002-06, gross foreign official inflows totaled $1,491 billion; net official inflows were only slightly less, as U.S. official outflows were negligible. Private foreign inflows net of private U.S. outflows totaled $1,659 billion during the same period; gross foreign private inflows were $4,697 billion. 11  Another way to make this point is that current account balances and surpluses give countries the flexibility to spend more or less than their current output, as dictated by economic conditions and needs. 6 BIS Review 99/2007 
and thus also benefited from running trade surpluses; more recently, as domestic demand in Europe has recovered, the trade surplus has declined.  Third, although the U.S. current account deficit is certainly not sustainable at its current level, U.S. liabilities to foreigners are not, at this point, putting an exceptionally large burden on the American economy. The net international investment position (NIIP) of the United States, although at a substantial negative 19 percent of GDP, is still smaller than the negative NIIP of several other industrial economies. As a fraction of net household wealth, which totaled almost $56 trillion in 2006, the negative NIIP is even smaller – less than 5 percent. Moreover, the U.S. investment income balance, which essentially represents the debt service on the NIIP, remains positive, at least for now. Thus, even after years of current account deficits and corresponding increases in net liabilities, the United States continues to earn more on its foreign investments than it pays on its foreign liabilities. And, as best we can tell, the share of U.S. assets in foreign portfolios does not seem excessive relative to the importance of the United States in the global economy. All that said, the current pattern of external imbalances – the export of capital from the developing countries to the industrial economies, particularly the United States – may prove counterproductive over the longer term. I noted some reasons for concern in my earlier speech, and they remain relevant today. First, the United States and other industrial economies face the prospect of aging populations and of workforces that are growing more slowly. These trends enhance the need to save (to support future retirees) and may reduce incentives to invest (because workforces eventually will shrink). If the United States saved more, one likely outcome would be a reduction in the U.S. current account deficit and in the rate at which the country is adding to its liabilities to the rest of the world. Second, the large U.S. current account deficit cannot persist indefinitely because the ability of the United States to make debt service payments and the willingness of foreigners to hold U.S. assets in their portfolios are both limited. Adjustment must eventually take place, and the process of adjustment will have both real and financial consequences. For example, in the United States, the growth of export-oriented sectors such as manufacturing has been restrained by the shifts in relative prices and foreign demand associated with the U.S. trade deficit. Ultimately, the necessary reduction in the trade and current account deficits will entail shifting resources out of sectors producing nontraded goods and services to those producing tradables. The greater the needed adjustment, the more potentially disruptive and costly these shifts may be. Similarly, external adjustment for China and other surplus countries will involve shifting resources out of the export sector and into industries geared toward meeting domestic consumption needs; that necessary shift, too, will likely be less disruptive if it occurs earlier and thus less rapidly and on a smaller scale.  On the financial side, if U.S. current account deficits were to persist at near their current levels, foreign investors would ultimately become satiated with dollar assets, and financing the deficit at a reasonable cost would become difficult. Earlier reduction of global imbalances would reduce the potential strains associated with financing a large quantity of international liabilities and likely allow a smoother adjustment in financial markets.  Finally, in the longer term, the developing world should be the recipient, not the provider, of financial capital. Because developing countries tend to have high ratios of labor to capital and to be away from the technological frontier, the potential returns to investment in those countries are high. Thus, capital flows toward those countries should benefit both them and the countries providing the capital. Prospects for reducing external imbalances What are the prospects for a gradual and orderly rebalancing of spending and external accounts around the world? The brief answer is that signs of progress have appeared but BIS Review 99/2007 7 
that most countries have only just begun to undertake the policy changes that will ultimately be needed.  Recently, the pickup in economic growth outside the United States, together with changes in the real exchange rate and other relative prices, has assisted the process of current account adjustment. Notably, during 2006, foreign growth helped U.S. real exports of goods and services grow 9.3 percent, and exports of capital goods rose 10.8 percent. Some of the gain in foreign growth is cyclical, but some is due to economic reforms (in both industrial and non-industrial countries) and thus may be more persistent. Overall, we have seen some modest indications of improvement in the U.S. external balance recently. For example, the non-oil trade deficit has declined modestly, from 3.7 percent of U.S. GDP in 2004 to 3.5 percent of GDP in 2006. In addition, in 2006, net exports made a positive contribution to U.S. real GDP growth, the first year that had happened since 1995. Net exports also contributed to U.S. growth in the first half of 2007. As is well known, however, further progress on the U.S. current account seems unlikely without significant increases in public and private saving in the United States. The U.S. federal budget deficit has declined recently and is officially projected to improve further over the next few years. Unfortunately, as I have noted, the United States has already reached the leading edge of major demographic changes that will result in an older population and a more slowly growing workforce. A major effort to increase public and private saving is needed to prepare for the economic consequences of this demographic transition and to address external imbalances. As the global perspective makes clear, the reduction of the U.S. current account deficit also requires efforts on the part of the surplus countries to reduce the excess of their desired saving over desired investment. Over the longer term, the current account surpluses of the emerging-market countries seem likely to narrow as domestic spending catches up with income. Economic policies in these countries can assist this process. For example, the oil exporters have collectively saved much of the windfall arising from higher crude prices in recent years; they should spend more in the future to develop and diversify their domestic economies. China has officially recognized the need to increase its domestic spending and scale back its reliance on exports. Measures that could help achieve these goals include further reforms of the financial sector; increased government spending on infrastructure, environmental improvement, and the social safety net; and currency appreciation. In East Asia excluding China, continued efforts to strengthen and deepen the banking sector and financial markets would help domestic investment recover from the lingering effects of the financial crises of the 1990s. In each of these cases, the indicated policies would reduce global imbalances. Moreover, as with U.S. saving efforts, these actions would convey important economic benefits to the countries undertaking them even if current account balances were not an issue. What implications would a gradual rebalancing have for long-term real interest rates? The logic of the global saving glut suggests that, as the glut dissipates over the next few decades and thereby reduces the net supply of financial capital from emerging-market countries, real interest rates should rise – a tendency that seems likely to be only partly offset by increased saving in the industrial countries. However, factors other than the saving-investment balance affect long-term interest rates, including the relative supplies of, and demands for, long-term securities and changes in the required compensation for the risk embedded in term premiums. Moreover, distant one-year forward interest rates remain low, an indication that markets currently do not expect much change in the global balance of desired saving and investment or that they expect the effects of such a change to be offset by other developments. Accordingly, we are again reminded of the need to maintain appropriate humility in forecasting returns and asset prices. 8 BIS Review 99/2007

Jean-Pierre Roth: The position of the Swiss franc exchange rate in the Swiss National Bank monetary policy strategy Summary of a speech by Mr Jean-Pierre Roth, Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank for International Settlements, at the University of St. Gallen, St. Gallen, 19 December 2007. The complete speech can be found in German on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). *      *      * The exchange rate is an important factor in determining the domestic price level in Switzerland. Nevertheless, it is not a monetary policy goal for the Swiss National Bank and is only relevant insofar as it has an impact on future inflation. Our concerns about our currency's weakness should not be read as a hidden form of exchange rate policy but rather as genuine concern about future price stability. A sustained tendency to weakness on the part of the Swiss franc could trigger inflationary effects that – sooner or later – would have to be countered with monetary policy instruments taking the form of interest rate measures. In the medium-term, this could lead to a reduction in the interest spread between the Swiss franc and the euro. BIS Review 151/2007 1 
Stanley Fischer: The Israeli economy, its banking system and Basel II Address by Professor Stanley Fischer, Governor of the Bank of Israel, to the Conference of the Association of Banks, Tel Aviv, 25 December 2007. *      *      * Today I will first speak about the state of the economy in Israel, and about the banking system as an important part of the economy; then I will talk of the Bank of Israel’s activity regarding competition in the banking system; and finally I will turn to Basel II. 1.  The state of the economy Israel’s economy is in a very good situation, and growth this year is expected to be 5.4 percent, or even slightly higher. Exports have risen rapidly, the current account of the balance of payments is showing a surplus of 4 percent of GDP, the debt/GDP ratio has fallen to about 82 percent of GDP, compared with about 102 percent in 2003, the strong inflow of foreign investment in Israel is continuing, unemployment is declining, and according to quarterly figures has already reached 7.3 percent, down from about 11 percent in 2003, the rate of participation in the labor market is rising, price stability has been maintained, and both financial and economic stability have been preserved. At the present time, the inflation rate is slightly higher than the upper bound of the target range, but it is expected to return to the target by around the middle of next year. The Bank of Israel, for its part, will make every effort to ensure this outcome. The auspicious state of the economy is reflected in the OECD’s invitation to Israel to start the process of joining the organization, the improved credit rating granted to Israel, the agreement of the US government to continue providing us with loan guarantees, and the report of the IMF delegation that visited Israel this month. Nevertheless, the future looks less rosy: it appears that the financial crisis in the US and Europe will become more severe. The central banks are searching for the right tools to deal with the problems of liquidity, and as a result of the difficulties in the financial markets the gaps between central banks’ interest rates and market rates are widening. The first signs of the fruits of the central banks’ efforts are becoming visible. If this continues, the interest rate gaps will again become more reasonable, but even then the problem of the collapse of the US housing market and its implications for the economy will remain. Till now there has been no evidence of a slowdown in the US economy. However, a slowdown is expected, and the financial crisis is likely to exacerbate the situation. Israel’s banks were hardly exposed to the situation that developed in the international financial markets. Nevertheless, Israel’s interest spreads have widened, and if a serious slowdown in the US occurs, it is bound to affect Israel’s economy too. The intensity of the potential impact on Israel depends on us. Therefore, it is imperative that the government continue to observe fiscal discipline, that the Bank of Israel continue to maintain price stability and to support financial stability, and that the banks continue with prudent, and particularly with cautious risk management. If all the above fulfill their functions properly, and if concurrently the business sector continues to display enterprise and to thrive, we will be able to continue to grow at a good pace, even against the background of some economic slowdown in the advanced economies. In the context of this strategy, our chances of achieving the main objective of economic policy will improve – to convert a high rate of growth into sustainable growth. Such growth is vital to the future of the country, society, and the economy. Growth has already improved the standard of living of the whole population in Israel and of all its strata. As a result, the rise in the poverty rate halted in 2006, based on the relative measure of poverty (which relates BIS Review 151/2007 1 
mainly to income differentials); based on the absolute measure of poverty (with relates to the ability to purchase a basket of basic goods), poverty actually declined in 2005 and 2006. In addition, unemployment has fallen from its peak in 2003 at all educational levels, including the lowest, the rate of participation in the labor market has risen in all parts of the country, including the outlying ones, and the rate of employment of Israelis and the average real wage has risen in all industries, including the low-technology ones. 2.  The Israeli banks What does this mean for Israel’s banks? It is clear that economic buoyancy affects the banks. The financial position of the banks in Israel has improved during the last few years, with regard to their profits, capital ratio, and the drop in the proportion of problem loans. Israel’s economy needs the banking system to remain strong and robust. However, it was not only correct management that contributed to their success – the improved economic situation also played a part. Therefore, I repeat the message that I delivered in my address last year (it sounds better in Yiddish): “Bad loans are made in good times.” This is an important thing to say at any time but particularly at the present time, in view of expectations of a growth slowdown in the global economy and, especially, the US economy, in 2008. On this point, an important aspect is the process in which the banks are currently engaged, with the support of the Supervisor of Banks – of raising the capital ratio. This process should be followed through to its completion. Before I turn to the subject of competition in the banking system, I would like to emphasize one especially important point. The banks have recently been subjected to a wave of attacks in the name of competition and customers’ wellbeing, and I too have leveled criticism with regard to one aspect, and that is bank fees. Sometimes the banks themselves take steps that seem to invite such attacks, but we must be extremely careful. A strong and stable banking system, as I have already stated, is vital to the robustness of the economy, and we must not weaken it. Although nearly all proposed legislation regarding banks purports to protect depositors, in certain cases it would harm the banks and the desire of other entities to act as competitors to the banks, and in the final analysis, the depositors themselves. It is thus essential that any initiative concerning the banking system be undertaken in full cooperation with the banking supervision. 3.  Competition in the banking system Competition in the banking system has been a focus of attention in the Bank of Israel and among the public for many years. There is a reasonable degree of competition in the area of banking services for the business sector, and the Bachar Committee dealt with competition in the credit and capital markets. This year bank fees were the focus of a great deal of attention. The Banking Supervision Department was deeply involved in the subject this year. Firstly, the Supervisor of Banks, together with the Knesset Economics Committee, successfully promoted the Bank Fees Law. Following that, the Banking Supervision Department, after investing a great deal of effort, drew up a new schedule of bank fees for households and small businesses. The new schedule is standard for all banks, and contains 68 fees, still not a small number, but significantly fewer than the 198 fees currently listed. The new schedule will make it easier for customers to know how much they will have to pay, and for what. This enables customers to compare the fees charged by the different banks, and to decide which offers the cheapest rates for which services. We hope that when the degree of competition has increased we will no longer have to supervise bank fees. The best supervision is that exercised by consumers and the markets. 2 BIS Review 151/2007 
In addition to the work invested in the subject of bank fees, the Bank of Israel was also very busy with many aspects of increasing the level of competition long term in banking services for households and small businesses. The underlying approach to this topic is to create sources of competition not only from within the banking system but also from outside it. The aim is to offer the Israeli consumer alternatives for certain services currently provided by the banks. In some areas this requires cooperation with other institutions, such as the Ministry of Finance (and specifically with the Commissioner of the Capital Market, Insurance and Savings), the Ministry of Justice, the Securities Authority, the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, the Anti-Trust Authority, and the Government Companies Authority. What are the main potential sources of competition for the banking system from without? 1. Money market funds. These are likely to compete for short-term local-currency deposits in banks. We hope that in due course they will be able to offer additional cash management services, such as drawing checks. 2. Commercial paper. These are likely to compete for short-term local-currency deposits in banks. 3. Repo-type transactions. These are likely to compete against short-term bank credit. 4. Securitization. This should contribute to the general development of the credit market, including nonbank credit. 5. A platform for online distribution of mutual funds. This may compete with the banks in their distribution of mutual funds. In addition to the above, there are other possible sources of competition from within the banking system: 1. Simplification of switching from bank to bank. This a very important step in encouraging competition within the banking system, and several significant measures have already been introduced by the Banking Supervision Department: banks need to provide customers with relevant information before customers close accounts and the process of switching banks has been simplified; the transfer of the account is handled by the bank to which the customer is moving; customers now have the possibility of transferring some of their activities; and the costs of transferring to another bank have been reduced. The Banking Supervision Department intends to tighten the enforcement of its directives in this regard and to increase customers’ awareness of it. The power to supervise bank fees will also enable steps to be taken as necessary to reduce the costs of switching between banks. 2. Increasing the transparency of banking activity for customers. The Banking Supervision Department intends to take further steps towards the uniformity and simplification of reports to customers on their banking and credit-card activities, and the provision of information about a given banking service before the customer commits him/herself by signing a contract The new fee schedule is an important move in this direction. 3. Increasing the chances of other banks entering the banking system. The more banks there are in Israel, the greater the choice facing customers, and the greater the competition. On this point there is a trade-off between the number of banks in the system—the more banks, the more competition – on the one hand, and their efficiency and robustness, on the other, and the latter is certainly a relevant consideration for the supervisory authorities This trade-off is a focal consideration when it comes to decisions on mergers between banks. BIS Review 151/2007 3 
The Banking Supervision Department is already taking steps to remove barriers to increase the chances of an internet bank operating in Israel, to advance the privatization of the Postal Bank and to regularize its banking activity, and to bring about the entry of a foreign bank into the field of retail banking in Israel. All of which, without waiving considerations of banking-system stability. Here it is important to stress the following two points: 1. The size of Israel’s economy, the high technological level of its banking system, and Israel’s geopolitical situation all play a part in foreign banks’ considerations about entering Israel’s retail banking market. 2. As I mentioned before, the attacks on banks, and I include in that the extensive legislative activity regarding banking, is likely to deter anyone, including foreign banks, from starting to operate in Israel. Some of the points made above are already being dealt with by the Bank of Israel, and others will be discussed by the Ariav Committee set up by the Minister of Finance and myself. The committee consists of the appropriate people in the relevant authorities and external experts in the field. The establishment of the committee signifies the importance that the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Israel, among others, attribute to the development of Israel’s financial system. Now we must allow the committee to get on with its work and to present its conclusions in due course. I now turn to my last subject for today: 4.  Basel II The adoption of the Basel II principles is one of the most important tasks being tackled by the Banking Supervision Department, and hence, by the banking system as a whole. Basel II is an advanced approach to bank management and supervision, based on the establishment of risk-management systems rather than detailed rules. This requires the banks to invest much effort in setting up sophisticated information and management systems and an extensive database. The Banking Supervision Department is devoting many resources to this subject. The Supervisor of Banks has already published a schedule and delineated the path to be followed in preparing for and completing the adoption of Basel II. This is an ambitious project, and it is very important that we succeed in implementing it. Adopting the Basel II principles and those of SOX 404 will improve overall management – and in particular risk management – and banks’ control, and will institute the highest international standards in Israel’s banking system. I hope that next year we will be able to stand on this platform and look back and see how much we have progressed in this vital aspect of banking, and in particular with regard to the competitiveness, efficiency, and robustness of the banking system. Thank you. 4 BIS Review 151/2007 
Rundheersing Bheenick: Bank of Mauritius – brief review of activities in 2007 Speech by Professor Rundheersing Bheenick, Governor of the Bank of Mauritius, at the launching ceremony of new notes and coins, Port Louis, 6 December 2007. *      *      * I welcome you all to this finale of the celebratory events of our 40th anniversary year. Over the last four months, on a more serious theme in our festivities, we have had a series of lectures on banking, money and finance. Professor Bishnodat Persaud addressed us from the West and spoke on trade, finance and currency. This was preceded by two reviews of monetary policy from Sweden by Professor Stefan Gerlach from the Bank for International Settlements, which is the central bank of central banks. Then, from Switzerland, we had Professor Philippe Bacchetta on Financial Market Development and Economic Growth. This week, we had a fascinating review of the changing axis of global finance and the rise of India and China by Dr Y. Venugopal Reddy, the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India. Finally, only yesterday, we had a special address at the Bank from my good friend Dr Paul Acquah, Governor of the Central Bank of Ghana who covered the raging debate on the performance of the IMF over the past decades. The heart of our job, or rather what we formally call our Corporate Responsibility, is to contribute to and I quote from the Bank of Mauritius Act 2004: “the orderly and balanced economic development of Mauritius”. As part of this, we are giving special attention to the importance of being a good corporate citizen. One special moment for me was in laying the foundation stone of our new building in Rodrigues to better serve the large community of our sister island. But the corporate function probably works best when it is done with a lighter heart and a looser step than was the practice of bankers of the distant past with their bowler hats and their pin stripe suits. Let me mention now some of our other activities in this anniversary year. • We have launched what we called originally a “Financial Literacy and Outreach Programme”. Now, if you mull over the acronym of a “Financial Literacy and Outreach Programme”, “FLOP”, you will understand why we changed this name to “Consumer Outreach Programme”, for “COP” sounds better than “FLOP”. • We have opened our doors to over-the-counter sales of security bills and bonds. • We had a Charity Dinner in this very venue in aid of the Epilepsy and Alzheimer associations. • Last week, I inaugurated with the Minister of Agro Industry and Fisheries, Dr A. Boolell, a bamboo garden at Midlands and we trust that other banks present here will follow suit with their own contributions to sustain the bio-diversity of our island. • We have also sponsored the Inter Clubs Youth Championships for boys and girls. • You have just heard about the Banknote Design Competition that we launched. The idea behind this was that people of my generation normally look to the past for our heroes and then we proceed to put their faces on our notes and their effigies on our coins and we thought that, perhaps, the younger generation may have a different take on this issue. So, we thought to give them a chance to design the future family of our banknotes. The results of this competition were just announced by the BIS Review 151/2007 1 
Chairman of the Jury Panel, Mr Tristan Bréville. I would like here to thank Mr Bréville and all his colleagues who worked on the Jury Panel and all those who participated in the competition and of course, a special word of congratulations to the winners. I am now pleased to move to the next stage of our event. We have three different launching events here tonight: (i) The first is the launching of a special commemorative coin which marks our 40th anniversary. It is a silver-proof coin and will go on sale as from Monday 10 December. (ii) The next, a sort of double first, is the twenty rupee coin we are launching today, the first of its kind in Mauritius. And the second part of this double first, is that this new coin, is the first bimetallic coin we have ever had in Mauritius. (iii) And the next item today involves a triple, a triple signature. As you know, the Central Bank now has two Deputy Governors. The new banknotes being issued today from the old family carry, for the first time, three signatures. So, if I may say, rather pleasingly, we celebrate today a first, the commemorative coin; a double first, the bimetallic twenty rupee coin; and a triple first, the new notes with three signatures. Now it is my pleasure and honour to invite our Vice-President, the Honourable Angidi Chettiar to unveil the coins and notes which will join our family of notes and coins. I thank you for your attention. 2 BIS Review 151/2007 
Caleb M Fundanga: Financial sector challenges and progress in Zambia Speech by Dr Caleb M Fundanga, Governor of the Bank of Zambia, at the Information Exchange Forum on Sources of Finance, Lusaka, 10 December 2007.  *      *      * • Mr Chairman • Representatives of International Financial Institutions • Chief Executives and representatives of Financial Institutions • Distinguished ladies and gentlemen I am greatly honoured to be given an opportunity to make some remarks at this forum. I wish to extend a warm welcome to all participants gathered here today, particularly those who have travelled from outside the country. I hope that you will not only have fruitful deliberations but also find time to explore the beautiful scenery and experience the warm hospitality that Zambia has to offer. Mr Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, this forum is more than timely as Zambia is working tirelessly towards financial deepening, wealth creation and reducing the levels of unemployment. In order to achieve this, affordable financial services should be available to the majority of businesses. In fact, the forum has come at an opportune time when the economy has shown signs of macroeconomic stability and growth. The financial sector in Zambia is considered relatively under developed. In spite of this status, post independence governments have always recognised the importance of the financial sector to national economic development. This is the reason why the activities of the sector had up until 1992 been controlled by the state. Since then, the financial sector has been liberalized while simultaneously strengthening the regulatory framework. Concerned with the limited contribution of the financial sector to economic development, the Government devised and formulated policy mechanisms for addressing a number of identified obstacles within the framework of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) whose implementation started in 2002. In line with the PRSP framework, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund undertook an assessment of the financial system through the Financial Sector Assessment Programme (FSAP) which was complimented by our own review. Some of the principle areas of concern identified included: • Low financial intermediation with limited access to financial services, especially for the rural and peri-urban population and the low-to-middle income earners; • Poor credit culture in the market; • Multiple and potentially conflicting roles of the government in the financial sector; • Weak regulatory framework for non-bank financial institutions, insurance and pension funds; • Undeveloped money and capital markets; and • Limited long-term development and housing finance. In recognition of the strategic importance of the financial sector to the country’s development and poverty reduction efforts, the Zambian government launched the Financial Sector Development Plan (FSDP) in 2004 to address weaknesses that had been identified in the financial sector. The FSDP is therefore a comprehensive strategy that is aimed at achieving a financial system that is sound, stable and market-based, that would support efficient resource mobilization necessary for economic diversification and sustainable growth. BIS Review 150/2007 1 
The financial sector weaknesses are being addressed through a public and private sector partnership. The implementation structure is chaired by the Secretary to the Treasury at Ministry of Finance and National Planning with the secretariat function responsible for the coordination of activities based at the Bank of Zambia. Mr Chairman, the goal of the FSDP is to have a financial system that is stable and market-based in order to support efficient resource mobilization necessary for economic diversification and sustainable growth. A number of reforms have already been undertaken under this plan. For instance, a Credit Reference Bureau has been established and we expect it to be operational in the coming year. In addition, studies have also been taken to comprehend the constraints to broader access financial services. One of the outputs of the FSDP has been a market knowledge study called Finscope Zambia which is a nationally representative survey of the use of, and demand for, financial services. It provides insights into how consumers source their income and manage their financial lives. This is the first time a survey like this has been conducted in Zambia and provides valuable information for players in the financial market. The survey, which was conducted in 2005, notes that very few Zambians use the formal financial sector. The report reveals that most Zambians prefer to invest in non-financial instruments such as a business, livestock, land or agriculture equipment. Mr Chairman, the year 2006 marked the eighth consecutive year of positive real growth in output while inflation declined remarkably to single digit level of 8.2%. During this period, investment was strong, particularly in the mining, tourism, construction, transport and agricultural sectors. This set a good basis for further favourable economic growth in the medium to long-term. Increased private sector investment, particularly in the mining sector, contributed to this growth. Mr Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, Zambia’s external position has also shown remarkable improvements with the trade surplus rising to US $1,176.0 million in 2006 from US $10 million in 2005. Similarly, the current account deficit as a percent of GDP (excluding grants) reduced to 2.3% from 11.8% during the same period. This outturn was mainly attributed to high receipts from increased copper exports. Debt relief and increased budget support from cooperating partners also helped strengthen the external position. Mr Chairman, the financial system has exhibited continued stability in the last eight years with the banking sector recording an average annual growth of more than 27% in total assets. Similarly, the deposit base has recorded an annual average growth of 28% over the same period. This is evidence of rising economic activities. However, the increase in the deposit base alone can not fully support the enormous need for access to affordable loan-able funds in the economy. I must mention here Ladies and Gentlemen, that financial markets in Zambia are still developing. With respect to money market developments, commercial banks lending rates have been declining but not at the rate as inflation or treasury bill rates. Commercial banks nominal average lending rate declined from 33.9% in December 2005 to 27.6% in December 2006 and stood slightly lower at 27.3% in February 2007. This is still on the high side for most entrepreneurs. However, there are positive indications from commercial banks due to the growing confidence in the economy and lower lending rates are therefore expected given the current environment of low inflation. Mr. Chairman, in the Non-Bank Financial Institutions (NBFIs) sector, institutional growth has continued to be a challenge. The number of NBFIs supervised by the Bank of Zambia has increased in the last 6 years, by 15% from 52 in 2001 when a specialized NBFIs department was established, to 60 today. The establishment of this specialised department was in response to: • the expansion of the NBFIs sector; 2 BIS Review 150/2007 
• the increased innovation in the sector; and • the increase in the number of NBFIs supervised by BoZ after amendments to the Banking and Financial Services Act (BFSA) in 2000. The increase in the number of new entrants in the NBFI sector has been due to the stability in the macro-economic environment in general and the financial sector in particular. To illustrate this further the BOZ receives on average about 7 applications per quarter, mainly from bureaux de change. This is also being driven by the growing demand for finance by both public and private investors in this sector. In the recent past for instance, a private leasing company received structured finance of US$10 million (or approximately K38 billion at today’s exchange rate) while the Development Bank of Zambia also issued a corporate bond of K68 billion (which is just under US$18million). Increased participation in both the money and capital markets by non-bank financial institutions with proposals for issuance of other corporate bonds are also under current consideration. Mr Chairman, some of the key sectors with potential investment include agriculture, mining, manufacturing, tourism and energy. Mr. Chairman, given all these developments which I have cited, one can tell that there are enormous possibilities for the financial sector in Zambia. In this regard, our expectation, at the Bank of Zambia, is that the financial sector should take a leading role in facilitating further developments in the areas which I have discussed. However, during our interactions, key players in the financial sector have informed us that they have a limited capacity to provide the required services in this regard. This forum has therefore been organized and arranged by the Bank of Zambia to bring together Zambian financial sector players and international financial players who have an interest to see that Zambia takes its rightful place in the world economy. Our expectation is that after this forum, we shall see the emergence of an interactive and symbiotic alliance between International and Zambia financial institutions whose goal will be to provide financial services that will uplift the well-being of the Zambian populace at large. This sounds like a difficult task to achieve but it is my conviction that it is better to begin a step towards this direction rather than waiting for it happen in future. On a lighter note, Ladies and Gentlemen, let me remind you that the Soccer World Cup to be hosted by South Africa in 2010, has attracted increased demand in the construction and tourism sectors in the whole Southern African Region. Zambia needs to take advantage of this and invest heavily in the tourism industry to benefit from the event; particularly that it has a vast number of national parks and the Victoria Falls, one of the seven natural wonders of the world. Obviously this can only be done if there is long term partnerships between local financial institutions and International financial institutions like the ones invited here today. Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, I thank you for your attention. BIS Review 150/2007 3 
Philipp Hildebrand: Global financial system developments and the Swiss banking sector Introductory remarks by Mr Philipp Hildebrand, Member of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the end-of-year media news conference, Zurich, 13 December 2007. *      *      * Six months ago, when our Financial Stability Report was published, I stated that "the global financial system and the Swiss banking sector (…) are moving forward at a pretty fast speed". In view of the credit market turmoil we have experienced since then, I would like to give you a brief updated assessment of the situation. I will then talk about some initial lessons that can be drawn from the latest developments. In particular, I will present some proposals as to how similar situations could be prevented or at least mitigated in future. Deterioration of the situation in the banking sector as a result of the credit market crisis Let me first give you my assessment of the current situation. On the whole, the position of the most important international banks in Switzerland is not as good as it was last June. The deterioration was mainly triggered by the crisis on the US sub-prime mortgage market. The slowdown in the US real estate market as well as surging interest rates in sub-prime mortgages led to a rise in loan defaults. Consequently, from July the prices of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) collapsed, after having remained practically constant for a long time. Even top-rated securities were affected by this slump. In the last few days, these prices have recovered a little, but volatility remains unusually high (cf. graph 1).

Crisis caused by high risks, insufficient transparency and inadequate risk management The sub-prime segment accounts for 12 to 15 percent of the US mortgage market. The US mortgage market, in its turn, corresponds to significantly less than 10% in value terms of total bonds and shares traded worldwide. How was it possible, then, that problems which were initially limited to just one segment could spread, triggering such widespread turmoil? Unfortunately, a lot of what has been unfolding has confirmed our fears of last June. First, it has become evident that the risks incurred by many banks were too high overall. There was an ever increasing willingness on the part of banks to accept high risk, which, for example, resulted in strong growth in lending and expanding balance sheets. Moreover, markets probably assessed existing risks too optimistically, as was evident in view of the extraordinarily low risk premiums on bonds, for example. Second, banks' increasing uncertainty about their own risks in the structured credit market and the creditworthiness of their counterparties turned out to be a handicap. Even the affected banks themselves did not know which contingent liabilities should be recorded on their balance sheets. Moreover, they had a lot of difficulty gauging the creditworthiness of their counterparties quickly and with sufficient accuracy. This confidence problem was particularly apparent in the interbank market. The risk premium for unsecured interbank loans has more than tripled since the onset of the US mortgage crisis. And, third, it has become clear that risk management has its limitations. In the area of market risk, events have occurred that – according to the models used – should not even have been possible, or at least would have been considered extremely unlikely. In the case of liquidity risks, it has become clear that assumptions and precautions based on normal times are not appropriate in extraordinary market situations.  Possible risks: contagion effects in related markets and deterioration of environment  What comes next? Is the worst already past? Unfortunately, there is no clear answer to this question. A risk analysis reveals that, ultimately, the future course of the crisis is likely to be determined by two major risks.  First, it is not impossible that problems which have so far been limited to a few partial markets could spill over to additional markets. Such a danger of contagion mainly exists for related credit markets that have so far been largely unaffected by the turmoil. These include, for example, commercial real estate. Risk premiums on these securities have been pointing in a clear upward direction of late (cf. graph 2). The same development can be observed for US corporate bonds. However, by historical standards, the delinquency rate on credit card loans remains at a very low level, even though it rose in the third quarter (cf. graph 3).  2 BIS Review 150/2007

Of particular note here is the global economy, which so far has proved to be extremely resistant to the sub-prime crisis. The same applies to the stock markets. Save for a few corrections, they have held up fairly well since the middle of the year. This has strengthened banks' earnings situation in areas outside of the real estate business, thereby enabling banks affected by the credit crisis to compensate part of their losses.

general economic environment were to deteriorate, this previous important source of stability would be adversely affected. Nevertheless, we must stress that the banks are still operating in a stable real economic environment, and that economic data from Europe, Latin America and Asia continue to provide evidence of robust growth momentum.  What can be learned from the current crisis? How can we ensure that the kind of market turmoil we are experiencing at present can be avoided in the future, or at least does not occur on this kind of scale? And how can we make sure that the banking sector will be in a position to emerge from comparable or even worse disruptions unscathed? Once again we need to stress that definitive conclusions cannot yet be drawn because the current crisis has not yet been overcome. However, as initial provisional lessons from the crisis, the following points seem particularly important to me. First, banks need to improve their transparency on a sustainable basis. The fact that, last summer, most banks came out with information on their positions in the sub-prime market only hesitantly, providing an incomplete picture, has made a significant contribution to the uncertainty in the interbank market. Consequently, we are reiterating our request that banks do a better job in making information available on their existing risks. In order to promote market discipline, it must be possible for outsiders to be able to assess a bank's resilience under both normal and stress conditions.  Second, recent events highlight the limitations of risk-weighted capital adequacy requirements. The problems in risk management have made it clear that the modelling of bank risks will always remain imperfect. In interpreting capital adequacy requirements which are based on such risk models, we must therefore proceed with appropriate caution. This is particularly relevant in view of the new capital adequacy requirements that will also be introduced in Switzerland next year. The main change under these requirements, known as Basel II, is that capital adequacy requirements will rely more heavily on banks' own risk assessments. Bearing this in mind, the lesson learned last summer may well have come at the right time. This now begs the question as to whether – in addition to the complex, risk-weighted capital adequacy requirements – other criteria, such as volume limits or the simple debt-equity ratio should not also be considered. The reason for this is that the higher this ratio, the greater the leverage effect of losses on the soundness of a bank. It is not that I intend to question the concept of risk-weighted requirements in any way. Rather, it is my wish to possibly strengthen these requirements by introducing supporting measures. For example, compared with risk-weighted requirements, volume limits or the debt-equity ratio have the advantage that such key figures are basically very transparent and are not based on complex models. Moreover, they calculate the only element that is relevant in a crisis, and that is the size of the buffer that a bank needs to absorb losses.  Third, it is a striking fact that, to date, hedge funds have not been a focus of the current crisis. To a considerable extent, this is attributable to a much improved management of counterparty risk in recent years. It is my view that banks should strengthen their risk management as regards their own refinancing decisions and risk allocation and not just with respect to external customers such as hedge funds. The kind of internal subsidising of refinancing costs for individual business areas observed in some cases creates false incentives. In future, the refinancing costs that a bank charges its internal risk centres should constitute an integral element of its risk management approach.  To sum up, I would like to state that it is certainly true that the current situation in the credit markets is very serious. At the same time, I want to stress that, fundamentally, the earnings capacity of our international banks is high, thanks to their diversified business model, and this increases their resilience. In this respect, the measures announced by UBS, which are aimed at strengthening its capital base, are to be welcomed. The fact that UBS has been able to attract a large and internationally recognised Asian investor for this purpose serves 4 BIS Review 150/2007 
as an illustration of one of the ways in which globalisation of financial markets has been to our advantage.  BIS Review 150/2007 5 
BIS Review 150/2007 1 Thomas Jordan: International money market disruptions, central bank reactions and lessons learnt Introductory remarks by Mr Thomas Jordan, Member of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the end-of-year media news conference, Zurich, 13 December 2007. *      *      * As early as the first half of 2007, turbulence could be observed now and then on international financial markets. However, each event was isolated and short-lived. In the second half of 2007, there was a fundamental change in the situation. The sub-prime mortgage crisis in the US had a substantial impact on international financial markets, the extent of which had never been anticipated. I will cover three areas in my following remarks. First, I will discuss the upheaval on the international money markets. Then I will talk about the reaction of central banks, in particular that of the Swiss National Bank. Finally, I will outline some of the lessons learnt from this crisis to date.  Serious disruptions on international money markets At the beginning of August, the US sub-prime mortgage crisis spread like a shock wave into the money markets of the most important currencies. In doing so, it hit the vital nerve of the international financial system. Well functioning money markets are essential in ensuring that financial market participants can adjust their liquidity positions. Ultimately, they are crucial for banks' solvency and long-term commercial viability. With attention focused on money markets, the spotlight also fell upon central banks who implement their monetary policy in money markets by influencing the level of interest, via the supply of liquidity. Moreover, the central banks are the only market participants who are in a position to create the liquidity used in the interbank payment systems.  The kind of upheaval observed in the international money markets over the past few months has never been witnessed in living history. Rumours and reports of substantial sub-prime positions at banks led to a sudden loss of confidence in international financial institutions. Moreover, these banks are, to some extent, uncertain about their own future liquidity situation. Consequently, banks subsequently began hoarding liquidity and became extremely cautious when granting credit to each another. The market for unsecured interbank loans over longer terms collapsed and at times the market for foreign exchange swaps dried up. Since then, banks have been unable to obtain unsecured funds for terms of more than a few days or weeks – or have been able to do so only by paying substantial interest premiums.  There were three factors that exacerbated the money market disruptions. First, bank securities holdings that had supposedly been first class and liquid proved to be illiquid, thereby failing to serve as a source of supplementary liquidity. Second, other participants in the financial markets also faltered in their supply of liquidity to the banks. Their confidence in banks suffered because money market investments that had been considered safe suddenly turned out to be risky. This led to the third exacerbating factor: Instead of helping the situation, off-balance sheet investment vehicles established by the banks made it far worse. Suddenly, these investment companies could no longer refinance themselves in the market and the banks were therefore forced to inject their own liquidity. Initially, the liquidity bottleneck manifested itself in the US dollar money market, above all. On the one hand, this was due to the fact that sub-prime losses and refinancing needs mainly affected US dollar positions. On the other, it was because liquidity hoarding also occurred chiefly in US dollars. US dollar liquidity was particularly tight for European banks. Thus 
2 BIS Review 150/2007 tensions spread rapidly from the dollar money market to the euro money market, but also to the Swiss franc money market. The extent of the upheaval on these three money markets can be seen in graph 1 which shows the path of risk premiums, using three-month funds as an example. Before the crisis, these risk premiums were almost negligible. They now amount to between 50 and 100 basis points, depending on the currency. The graph also shows that, so far, the crisis has moved forward in two waves. After normalising to some extent in October, the situation became increasingly tense from mid-November onwards, after more bank losses had been reported.  Stabilisation by central banks The turbulence on the money market is challenging central banks. Although the way in which they steer their individual money markets differs, ultimately they provide just the amount of liquidity that is necessary to maintain the key monetary policy rate at the targeted level.  The SNB reacted rapidly, and was the very first central bank to provide additional liquidity, which it did on 9 August, by means of fine-tuning measures. In the course of the following days, we continued to provide the banking system with generous supplies of funds as part of our regular auction procedure. In this way, we succeeded in rapidly defusing tensions on the call money market. Since then, we have carrying out fine-tuning measures on a consistent basis, in order to dampen sharp fluctuations in the call money rate in either direction. This has allowed us to stabilise the very short-term Swiss franc money market.  However, we were unable to prevent risk premiums in interbank business from rising, since this is largely independent of our measures. As can be seen in graph 2, the three-month Swiss franc Libor had risen to 2.90% by mid-September 2007, which was substantially above the level targeted by us. By international standards, however, the increase in Libor was minimal. Our monetary policy decision of 13 September was aimed at further calming the Swiss franc money market, by bringing the three-month Libor back down to around 2.75%. With this in mind, we made funds available to banks for a term of three months. We did this from the day of the monetary policy assessment onwards. It was the first time we had done so since the introduction of the repo as a monetary policy instrument. At the same time, we undertook a significant reduction in the repo rate used for our transactions. Our aim was to compensate the higher risk premiums through a lower repo rate, and to move the three-month Libor back into the middle of the target range. The desired reaction ensued within a few days and the three-month Libor stabilised at 2.75%. We thereby neutralised the monetary policy impact of the higher risk premium. As announced a short while ago, we will also be supplying the market with ample liquidity as we approach the end of the year, and will be conducting longer term repo transactions with this in mind.  At the operational level, steering the three-month Libor proved to be a challenge, due to the high and fluctuating level of the risk premium. Simultaneously, the benefits of our operational flexibility became very clear. Since we are generally present in the market on a daily basis with short-term repo transactions, we were in a position to adjust liquidity measures to individual market conditions. Over the past few months, we have made consistent use of this flexibility; first, by providing the banking system with generous amounts of seven-day money, gradually lowering the repo rates as we did so, and second, by absorbing liquidity that was no longer required as soon as the call money rate declined. In this way, it was possible to retain overall liquidity in the bank system at an appropriate level. As you will see in graph 3, the average level of bank sight deposits changed very little throughout the year, if we compare each minimum reserve period with the next.  Our other operational processes have also stood up well in the turmoil of the past few months. Payment transactions carried out between banks in the SIC system ran smoothly at all times, although banks have made greater use of SNB intraday loan facilities. In order to bridge liquidity bottlenecks at the end of the day, the National Bank provides a liquidity-shortage financing facility to banks. This allows them to obtain liquidity on a temporary basis 
BIS Review 150/2007 3 when needed, provided they have a limit with the SNB and provided this limit is continually covered with eligible securities. The continual coverage of the limits ensures that the banks have access to a liquidity cushion, even in critical situations. Actual use of the limits is generally restrained, and this has also been the case in recent months. Lessons learnt I would like to draw your attention to some of the lessons that we have already learnt from the current crisis. I will mention four points. First, the worldwide money market upheaval clearly shows how highly integrated international financial markets are today. Local crises can spread around the globe in a flash. The money market crisis is unlikely to have been overcome yet. Confidence among financial market participants remains insufficient. The pressure on participants who are still only able to refinance themselves in the market on a very short-term basis remains high. As long as uncertainty with respect to the scope of the credit problems exists, the disruptions on the money market are likely to persist.  Second, the central banks have played a fundamental role in calming and stabilising the money markets through close consultation and targeted operations. The SNB reacted rapidly to the tensions in the Swiss franc money market. The flexibility of our monetary policy instruments demonstrated its value in this difficult setting. Above all, short-term interest rates calmed as a result of the measures taken. The difficulties in bank refinancing over longer terms and the rise in risk premiums in the money market came about through the loss of confidence. Central banks can not compensate this lack of confidence simply by injecting additional liquidity. On the contrary, the financial market participants themselves must take the fundamental steps needed to restore this confidence. Third, the crisis in the money market once again clearly demonstrates that liquidity management is a core task of each and every bank, falling within the direct accountability of bank executive management. Liquidity provisioning must begin in good times. It is critical that sufficient liquid assets be held. Only first-class securities are suitable for this purpose. These can be sold in the markets or mobilised via repo transactions, even in difficult conditions. In an acute crisis situation, the availability of sufficient liquidity, together with a strong equity position, is absolutely crucial. Fourth and finally, I would like to mention that, in the Swiss franc money market, repo business via the Swiss Value Chain has proved to be a crisis-resistant source of liquidity, thanks to the consistent minimisation of risks. The repo market allows participants to undertake rapid refinancing in the interbank market, independent of credit limits, thereby making a major contribution to the stability of the financial system. That is why it is important for the SNB that all Swiss and foreign banks operating in the Swiss franc money market join the Swiss repo system.

Timothy F Geithner: Restoring market liquidity in a financial crisis  Welcoming remarks by Mr Timothy F Geithner, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, at the Second New York Fed-Princeton University Liquidity Conference, New York, 13 December 2007. *      *      * Welcome to the New York Fed and to this conference on liquidity. You are addressing some of the most important issues affecting financial markets today. Your timing is good, perhaps too good. We are all going to need some time and perspective before we will know enough to draw conclusions and recommendations from the events of the past six months. The conditions that led to this crisis took a long time to develop and they will take some time to resolve. I think it is appropriate, though, that as central banks act to address the challenges in markets today, we also begin to define the agenda for future research and policy.  On December 12, the Federal Reserve and several other major central banks, announced a series of actions in response to the elevated pressures in funding markets. Together, these actions provide a more flexible and potentially more effective set of instruments, alongside our conventional monetary policy instruments, to help mitigate the risks that liquidity pressures in markets going forward could pose to the broader economy. With this framework of tools, we have the capacity to calibrate our response as market conditions change.  Although the specifics vary across central banks, the approaches outlined have several important common elements. We each have taken actions to provide more financing at terms longer than overnight. We each have chosen to auction funding against a broader range of collateral, collateral other than government securities, and in our case with a broader set of counterparties. And we have activated swap lines to help the relevant central banks provide liquidity in dollars in their markets.  The initial spark to the pressures we observe in markets today was the sharp deterioration in the value of nonprime mortgage securities and the resulting increase in uncertainty about the value of a much larger amount of financial assets exposed to that risk. This was magnified by a substantial increase in uncertainty about the economic outlook and the consequences of that uncertainty for asset values and credit losses. Financial institutions faced a sharp drop in demand for a range of assets, impairing the securitization market as a source of funding. And a substantial amount of these illiquid assets were held in vehicles with implicit or explicit liquidity guarantees provided by banks. This produced a large unexpected increase in demand for funding from banks at the same time banks confronted a reduced capacity to raise financing.  As market participants have adjusted to what has been a very acute change in expectations about economic and credit risk, they have become more cautious in how they use their liquidity and capital. The symptoms of this are apparent in the high risk premia across a range of assets, as well as in the dramatic contraction in the volume of transactions for certain assets and the securities that reference those assets. Elevated term premia in the interbank market has the effect of tightening overall financial conditions, offsetting some of the impact of reductions in the target federal funds rate. The danger this poses is the risk of an adverse, self-reinforcing dynamic in which concerns about overall liquidity magnify concerns about credit problems. As financial institutions prepare for a more challenging funding environment, in part by conserving capital, and as they anticipate the higher potential losses that would normally accompany an economic slowdown, their response, in aggregate, makes markets and the economy potentially more vulnerable to that adverse outcome. The risk is a greater contraction in the availability of credit beyond what might have otherwise occurred, with attendant risks to growth.  BIS Review 149/2007 1 
Monetary policy has an important role to play in addressing these dynamics in markets. By adjusting policy proactively as the risk to the outlook changes, central banks can help reduce the probability of the extreme adverse outcome. And this can positively affect the incentives that might otherwise lead market participants to protect themselves against the extreme outcome. Central banks have been employing a range of different tools to help reduce the incentive for an excessive level of liquidity hoarding by banks that might impede an efficient flow of liquidity among banks. Although the mix of tools and approaches has varied across the major economies, each has tried to provide a more effective form of liquidity insurance to its financial institutions by expanding the capacity of banks to borrow at longer maturities from the central banks against a broader range of collateral. The actions to address liquidity issues – those we announced this week and those that we have taken over the past five months – can help reinforce our monetary policy actions by providing greater assurance for market participants of access to funding. By allowing strong banks to borrow against collateral that they can no longer easily finance in the market, the central bank is providing an additional source of liquidity to banks as a complement to our open market operations.  The Term Auction Facility gives us a tool that lies somewhere between our open market operations and our primary credit program. It provides a mechanism for expanding the range of collateral against which we provide funds to the market – in effect to change the composition of our balance sheet – in ways we cannot do through traditional open market operations. And it does this in a way that may be more effective in mitigating a broader marketwide liquidity shortage than does the existing discount window facility, in part because of the perceived stigma in recourse to a facility that has come to be regarded as a source of funds for individual institutions facing a temporary, exceptional need for liquidity. Because the quantity of funds to be injected is known in advance, this mechanism poses fewer complications for our ability to reduce volatility in the fed funds rate around the target.  The auction facility and other measures we have taken to address market liquidity problems do not directly address the balance sheet or capital constraints facing financial institutions. Nor can they be expected directly to reduce the perceived risk in exposure to other financial counterparties. But by providing a more effective form of access to liquidity, these new measures can help reduce the uncertainty that gives institutions the incentive to secure liquidity in ways that might lead to a further deterioration on market conditions.  Major financial institutions in the United States and elsewhere entered this period of adjustment with capital substantially above the various regulatory thresholds. These capital cushions have enabled banks to expand their balance sheets as they have met contingent commitments and as the economics of other non-bank financing vehicles have deteriorated. This has been an important part of the adjustment process in markets.  We have also seen some early steps by a range of different institutions to bring new capital into the banking and financial system. This is a healthy development. It reduces the need for further asset sales to preserve capital ratios. And it gives those institutions that acted earlier and on a more substantial scale the flexibility to play a greater role in markets and in the economy going forward.  Finally, let me say something about future challenges in this area that are of special relevance to today’s conference and to the research agenda in which you are all engaged. We are already involved in a coordinated review with other central banks and supervisors of how we should adapt policy and supervision in the wake of this financial crisis. Two issues are of particular interest in the context of this conference. The first relates to the incentives we create, through regulation and supervision and other policies, for influencing how financial market participants manage liquidity risk. Several aspects of the existing capital framework and other parts of the policy and regulatory 2 BIS Review 149/2007 
framework affect these incentives. In addition, the evolution of the financial system has altered the role and importance of liquidity provision by banks and how that provision of liquidity responds to different types of stress to the financial system. The second issue relates to the tools that central banks have at their disposal for providing liquidity in ways that do support our monetary policy objectives. Do we need additional instruments that would better enable us to mitigate marketwide liquidity problems? And how can we mitigate the moral hazard risk inherent in such instruments? Efforts are underway to address these issues both within the Fed and among our central banking colleagues around the world. We will be looking both to financial market participants and to the academic community for advice. For now, though, our principal task is to address the challenges of the present. The Federal Reserve Act gives us broad authority to act in response to these types of conditions. We will continue to examine ways to adapt our instruments as market conditions evolve. We will do so in close cooperation with other central banks, as indeed we have since August. And we will do so in the tradition of pragmatism and flexibility that has been one of the defining features of the central bank of the United States.  Thank you. BIS Review 149/2007 3 
Rasheed Mohammed Al Maraj: Challenges facing Islamic financial institutions Speech by His Excellency Rasheed Mohammed Al Maraj, Governor of the Central Bank of Bahrain, at the 14th Annual World Islamic Banking Conference 2007, Manama, 9 December 2007. *      *      * Fellow Governors, Excellencies, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen. On behalf of the Central Bank of Bahrain, may I welcome you all to the Inaugural Plenary Session of today’s conference. May I take this opportunity to thank the sponsors and organisers of this Conference which this year concentrates on the mechanisms to encourage the growth of the Islamic banking industry whilst containing its risks. Over the last 20 years we have seen the establishment of several of Islamic banks and financing companies as well as Islamic banking windows as banks have rushed to satisfy the appetite of investors and consumers for Sharia compliant products to finance assets from cars and houses to aircraft and project finance. However as banks have flourished in number, there is increasing evidence that banks will find it difficult to maintain the pace of innovation that marked the 1990s. Islamic banks seem to be increasingly focused on real estate and asset finance but not moving into other financial or liquid instruments with active secondary markets. Perhaps we can take this opportunity to look at the challenges facing Islamic banking and see how the industry, its regulators and stakeholders may respond. The first challenge is the success of Islamic Banking. The sensational growth that has brought Islamic banks such high profits over the past five years coupled with high levels of liquidity have meant that Islamic banks have not had to fight for funding or ideas. The result is that we are seeing too many Islamic banks with the same business models and structures.  The availability of plentiful liquidity coupled with the explosion of real estate projects in the MENA region have conspired to breed a level of, dare I say it, complacency in some Islamic banks. Many Islamic investment banks are project-driven and do not have a steady source of "bread and butter" revenue to tide them over any slumps in economic activity. This is in contrast to many of the major conventional banks with loan books, overdraft and credit card facilities to provide steady revenue to cover overheads. Another challenge facing Islamic banks is the multiplicity of Sharia boards and judgements. This leads to a lack of homogeneity for some products on the one hand, and a lack of uncertainty by clients as to whether a product developed in one jurisdiction is Sharia compliant in a neighbouring jurisdiction. Islamic financial products need some level of harmonisation in terms of product features to gain mass acceptance. We at the Central Bank of Bahrain are working with the International Islamic Financial Market to set certain standards on some capital and money market products, but banks themselves could work more closely to establish common disclosure standards for the costs of financing. Additionally, we at the Central Bank have noted the continuing need for high quality human resources within Islamic banks. Islamic banking has been growing so fast that it has been difficult for banks to find enough skilled or qualified staff. This is why the CBB has participated with Islamic institutions in Bahrain in setting up the Waqf fund to provide financial and technical support in upgrading current training programs and introduce new ones. It is hoped that we will begin to see a larger number of financiers qualified in Sharia – related subjects in the near future. Such initiatives can only be to the benefit of Islamic banking and I urge more institutions to participate in the funding and support of the fund and its works.  I think at this point I should talk about governance challenges facing Islamic financial institutions. BIS Review 149/2007 1 
A major issue which is growing in importance is Sharia compliance and how to provide a satisfactory framework to assure investors and other stakeholders that the activities of the bank are within the permitted scope of Sharia. Islamic banks have various mechanisms to ensure Sharia compliance in the products and activities of the institution. The first and most obvious body is the Sharia Supervisory Board. This body produces judgements or fatwas on products or structures that the bank intends to provide. The next body is the Internal Sharia Review function which performs post-facto reviews of the activities of a bank. The last body is the external auditor which, in addition to verifying the accounts of the bank, also checks to ensure that the bank correctly followed AAOIFI Sharia standards. There are differing perceptions about the respective scope of authority of these three bodies and therefore there is a need to reach consensus on the functions of these respective bodies. This is clearly an area where the institutions, Sharia scholars and the standard setters need to agree upon what constitutes best practice and set an agreed set of standards. The next challenge is that of accounting standards. There are currently some 60 AAOIFI accounting, auditing, governance and Sharia standards. This body of work is testimony to the commitment and continuing efforts of AAOIFI since its establishment in 1990 to the development of accounting and auditing standards for Islamic institutions. However, products continue to develop rapidly and concepts such as “fair value” have come to centre stage. Conventional accounting standards have responded accordingly. Two such examples are IAS 39 and IFRS 7. Corresponding modifications to existing AAOIFI standards have not yet been made. This means that, for rating purposes or competitive reasons, Islamic banks may need to follow IFRS where AAOIFI standards do not fully cover the concerned product or disclosure. This lack of equivalent AAOIFI standards is making difficulties in producing financial statements for Islamic banks. Additionally, both AAOIFI and IFSB standards need to be adopted by more institutions and regulators to reinforce their status as the benchmark standards in Islamic finance. I trust that the above challenges need to be addressed by regulators, Islamic banks and the support organisations to consolidate the position of Islamic finance. Please accept my best wishes for a rewarding and stimulating conference. Thank you. 2 BIS Review 149/2007 
Paul Tucker: Money and credit – banking and the macroeconomy Speech by Mr Paul Tucker, Executive Director and Member of the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England, at the Monetary Policy and the Markets Conference, London, 13 December 2007. My thanks for comments and/or for background work to Peter Andrews, Charlie Bean, Tim Besley, Roger Clews, Andy Haldane, Colin Miles, James Proudman and Iain de Weymarn. Special thanks to Jing Yang and Alex Haberis. For comments and background work to Damien Lynch. And for secretarial support to Sandra Bannister and Cheryl Feeney.  *      *      * Each month the MPC sets a policy rate, Bank Rate, that will prevail until our next policy meeting. But no one – here today, in the market, or on the Committee – thinks that setting the overnight money market rate for the coming 30 days can be enough to steer demand conditions and maintain stable inflation. Rather, policy works on the basis of expectations of the path of the Bank Rate in the future, and of how our policy settings will vary according to economic conditions: the so-called “reaction function”.  Perceptions of the reaction function therefore matter a lot and a great deal of effort goes into being transparent about the three inputs: the Committee’s objective; the MPC’s views on the shocks to demand and supply affecting the economy; and our views on how the economy works and how our policy settings affect it. This conference is focused on one important element of this: the role of financial markets in the setting and transmission of monetary policy. That is covered in the Bank’s publications on how the economy works, including the Committee’s 1999 paper on the Monetary Transmission Mechanism (MTM), and books describing the models used in forecasting.1 But those high-level descriptions miss out an awful lot about how the real and financial parts of the economy connect. Financial variables are limited to the short-term interest rate, the exchange rate, and equities. Nothing on the role of long-maturity interest rates, or on credit spreads and risk premia – which misses out a whole universe of financial asset prices. Very little on credit more generally. Next to nothing on money. And nothing at all on the role of bank intermediation. These gaps were perhaps underlined by a degree of confusion amongst commentators about the way in which Money and Credit featured somewhat more prominently in the Committee’s discussions during the backend of 2006 and into this year (Chart 1). With both having been strong for a while, some asked whether this marked some kind of change in the reaction function, implying a greater stress on nominal variables. Given the near identity of deposits and bank lending, Money and Credit are often used almost inseparably, even interchangeably, with wider measures of non-bank credit looked at only when assessing the health of corporate and household sector balance sheets. But in some circumstances one can do better to approach things the other way round, starting with general credit conditions, examining the interactions of non-bank and bank lending, and then broad money as a (partial) counterpart to M4L. My remarks today will follow that structure, which will provide a framework for some observations about the current tightening in credit conditions, as well as about the preceding expansion.                                                   1  “The transmission mechanism of monetary policy”, a paper by the Monetary Policy Committee at the Bank of England, April 1999 and Harrison R., K. Nikolov, M. Quinn, G. Ramsay, A Scott and R. Thomas, “The Bank of England Quarterly Model”, Bank of England 2005. The Bank’s wider “suite of models” does include richer asset price channels. BIS Review 149/2007 1 
Credit Credit is, of course, vital to any economy, enabling households and firms to make choices about whether to bring forward or defer spending from income. There are conditions in which it would play no active role, passively reflecting cyclical fluctuations in output, employment and inflation. In a world of more or less complete transparency between borrowers and lenders, very low transactions costs, and very low risk aversion, access to credit would not be rationed; and ex ante yields on financial assets, including loans and bonds, would not embody risk premia. So if households and firms wanted to bring forward spending in the face of shocks to the economy, they would be able to do so restricted only by their need to remain solvent.  But nobody believes that that is a description of the real world in which households and companies manage their affairs. Both are, to a greater or lesser degree, rationed in their access to credit, given that borrowers know a great deal more about their conditions and prospects than do risk-averse lenders, and that lenders face obstacles in ensuring that borrowers honour their contracts.2 The availability, price and terms of credit– whether unsecured or secured – will be sensitive to a range of factors, including assessments of the idiosyncratic risks of a particular borrower, and the risks common across borrowers. Variations in these factors give rise to the possibility of a credit cycle.  A borrower’s ability to pledge collateral can help to overcome the problems of “asymmetric information” and enforceability, by evidencing its net worth and giving it a continuing stake in its contract with the lender. This can give rise to the so-called “financial accelerator” channel of the Monetary Transmission Mechanism (MTM), in which monetary policy works partly by affecting lending terms through its effect on asset values and so the net worth of borrowers.3  But credit conditions also depend on the access to credit of the lenders themselves. There is an important distinction here between intermediation across bank balance sheets and via the capital markets, although as I shall describe it turns out to be blurred.  Total credit: capital markets and securitisation For the moment, I shall put that distinction to one side in order to focus on total credit. A series of environmental changes over the past decade or so have affected the quantity and price of credit generally. Greater macroeconomic stability, and perceptions that it will persist more or less uninterrupted, probably increased the supply of credit; and by reducing risk premia, may have increased demand too (Diagram A).  Other developments are more likely to have worked purely through credit supply. The most obvious is the growth of instruments such as credit derivatives and securitisation, associated with an increased role for rating agencies in monitoring credit risk. This was in effect a shock to technology, making portfolios transferable. By offering the prospect of better meeting desired risk profiles and by separating origination from investment, it has brought more non-bank financial institutions, and so more capital resources, into the credit markets, increasing the supply of credit (Diagram B). This seems to have been borne out in the significant shift in actual credit quantities and prices up to the middle of this year.  In the United Kingdom, non-bank lenders have accounted for a greater share of credit extension to both the household and corporate sectors (Charts 2-4).                                                   2  Stiglitz, J. E. and A. Weiss (1981), “Credit rationing in markets with imperfect information”, The American Economic Review, Vol. 71, No. 3, pp 393-410. 3  Bernanke, B. and M. Gertler (1989), “Agency cost, net worth, and business fluctuations”, The American Economic Review, March 1989, pp 14-31. 2 BIS Review 149/2007 
A lot of that has been securitised (Chart 5). For the household sector, spreads on securitised portfolios of both secured and unsecured credit fell between 2003 and 2005 (Chart 6). That will have contributed to the fall in effective rates on the underlying mortgages and personal loans (Chart 7).  The same broad picture holds for the corporate sector (Chart 8). An illustrative decomposition suggests that, especially for sub-investment grade borrowers, the compression of spreads could not be explained solely by reduced compensation for default risk, with the excess possibly reflecting lower liquidity premia (Chart 9).4  These falls in spreads were material relative to the changes in the MPC’s Bank Rate and to the risk-free yield curve. For example, in the latest “policy cycle”, we increased Bank Rate by 125bp over 11 months from August 2006. During that period, effective rates on new mortgages rose by closer to 50bp. In other words, from around 2003, monetary policy needed to take account of a progressive loosening of credit conditions.  The tables have now turned. Spreads have risen; the issuance of securitised portfolios of household loans has collapsed; corporate bond issuance has fallen (Charts 10-11). It is pretty clear that, for the time being, there has been an adverse shift in the supply of credit from the non-banking sector. In part, that seems to be due to investors becoming less confident that they can base decisions about exposures to complex credit portfolios on rating agency ratings; this is akin to lenders deciding that their monitoring of risk was less good than they thought. In part, it is due to various types of non-bank investor in credit finding themselves facing actual or incipient liquidity pressures. Both as cause and effect, liquidity in the capital markets is impaired. This is apparent in the opening up of a so-called “negative basis” between the spreads on corporate bond and on equivalent credit-default swaps, which unbundle the transfer of credit risk from the provision of funds and so are less affected by liquidity hoarding (Chart 12).  A twin-engine financial system?  At various times over the past decade or so, it had been argued5 that the macroeconomy as a whole should be more resilient to shocks to a financial system with “twin engines” – combining capital markets with banking system intermediation of savings and credit. The argument is that when the capital markets are impaired, banking can take more of the burden, and vice versa. I have a good deal of sympathy for this view – but not for all circumstances. It rather overstates the independence of capital markets and banking, as recent developments graphically demonstrate.  First, whether through financing the purchase of credit assets by leveraged funds or warehousing portfolios prior to sale or providing “liquidity lines” to conduits and other investment vehicles, the banking system puts its capital and liquidity behind the distribution of credit risk to the wider asset-manager universe. As the official sector stressed over recent years, it is important to be clear about the circumstances in which risk can flow back to the banking system.6  Second, the “twin engines” view draws too absolute a line between banks and non-bank financial intermediaries. Alongside other asset managers, banks have been material investors in securitised credit. In some respects, it may be more useful to distinguish                                                  4  See Churm R., and L. Webber (2007), “Decomposing corporate bond spreads”, Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, Q4 2007 (forthcoming). 5  Alan Greenspan made this point a few times. 6  For example see Tucker P M W (2007), “A perspective on recent monetary and financial system developments”, speech at Merrill Lynch Conference on Hedge Funds, Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, Q3 2007, pp 310-16. BIS Review 149/2007 3 
between intermediaries on the basis of whether they undertake some combination of maturity transformation, leveraging their balance sheets, and mark-to-market valuations. Banks are not alone in having these characteristics, and so there can be common shocks to bank and non-bank investors. In a recent series of papers,7 Hyun Shin has argued that balance sheet management of this kind amplifies the credit cycle. That sounds like the “financial accelerator” model, except that Shin’s position is that the outcomes can exceed those warranted by fundamentals. His argument is that in the upswing of a business cycle, the rise in asset values increases the accounting net worth of banks and other intermediaries, enabling them to leverage up their balance sheets. This expands credit; and increases the liquidity in capital markets, reducing liquidity premia embodied in asset prices; and so on. And when the music stops, the process can be reversed as falls in asset values, leverage and liquidity feed on each other. (For Shin, the villain is mark-to-market accounting, although I would not want its virtues in reducing forbearance to be overlooked.) Thirdly, the “twin engines” view may place insufficient weight on banks having remained the principal originators of credit, given that small firms and households cannot issue bonds directly into the capital markets. It has been argued that the growth of markets for securitising loan portfolios made banks less relevant to overall credit conditions, and so to the business cycle, because a bank’s ability to originate credit becomes less intimately bound up with its own financial strength.8 But if, as currently, the capital markets’ appetite for securitised credit diminishes, a larger proportion of loans will after all remain on the balance sheets of banks.  All this brings back into focus the potential macroeconomic relevance of bank lending.  Bank lending The economic literature on the “bank lending” channel of the Monetary Transmission Mechanism explores the conditions under which a tightening of monetary policy causes the terms on bank lending to tighten over and above the increase in risk-free short-term real rates. The literature has typically assumed (i) that a monetary policy tightening is effected by the central bank withdrawing reserves from the system (or slowing the pace of reserves injection); (ii) that banks are required to hold a proportion of transactions deposits in reserves, so that reduced reserves provision entails slower deposit growth; and (iii) that they do not have unrestricted access to liabilities that are not subject to reserves requirements, and so cannot fill the gap left by slower deposit growth and must, instead, slow loan growth, which they do by tightening credit conditions.9 The first two steps seem archaic. We effect monetary policy changes by controlling the price not the quantity of central bank money in the system; and, in the UK, banks choose their own reserves targets rather than having them determined by a balance sheet ratio of some kind.  But the third plank in these models – restricted access to non-deposit liabilities, whether capital-like or not – plainly is still relevant today. In a world of asymmetric information, banks do not have unrestricted access to resources, and we do not believe that a bank’s lending                                                  7  Adrian, Tobias, and H.

Adrian, Tobias and H S Shin, (2007), “Liquidity and Financial Cycles”, paper presented at the 6th BIS annual conference on “Financial System and Macroeconomic Resilience”. Analytically, the argument, as summarised in the main text, needs to be supplemented with a mechanism that somehow impedes checks and balances from preventing the overshooting of fundamentals. 8  Loutskina E. and P. E.

behaviour is invariant to its capital gearing or to the composition of its liabilities.10 We do, therefore, face questions about the extent to which a shock to banks’ liquidity or capital resources can bring about a shift in credit conditions with macroeconomic effects that, other things being equal, monetary policy should seek to offset in order to maintain aggregate demand in line with aggregate supply.  Over the past 15 years or so, when banks have seemed anything but restricted, easier access to liquidity or capital may have brought about a progressive relaxation of bank lending conditions. That this featured in commentary on monetary policy rather less than the recent manifest tightening may say no more than that sharp contractions attract more attention than gradual expansions. In a similar vein, on the whole, research does better at identifying these “credit channel” mechanisms in the context of particular stressed episodes than in longer-run averages.11Be that as it may, it is beyond doubt that there has recently been an adverse shock to bank balance sheets – involving capital, liquidity, and a potent “asymmetric” information mechanism affecting a wide range of banks. I will pick out four elements in the story, involving liquidity, counterparty-credit risk and capital.  First, near closure of the capital markets for leveraged loans, conduit and SIV commercial paper, and RMBS has left banks whose business model is “originate and distribute” unexpectedly holding on to loans and, in addition, facing the prospect of having to take assets back on to their balance sheets. The consequent reintermediation is a hit to both capital ratios and liquidity, as the banks have bigger books to fund. For these reasons alone, big picture, banks responded from August onwards by tightening loan terms and hoarding liquidity.  But the story does not end there. The second element is that access to resources (uninsured deposits) from outside the banking sector has become more restricted since the summer. While the new risk-transfer instruments have plainly dispersed risks, lack of ex ante disclosure left market participants highly uncertain about the scale and distribution of losses across the banking sector itself. On top of that, open-ended investment vehicles that have (or may have) themselves invested in structured-finance paper have felt compelled to preserve liquidity, to guard against redemption risk. And one significant source of demand for bank hybrid-capital instruments over the past half-decade or so, the SIVs, has been turned off due to their own funding problems. Taken together, the upshot for the banking system has been a shortening in the maturity of wholesale deposits, and an intermittent tightening of access to hybrid capital instruments (Chart 13).  Coming on top of an involuntary increase in risk-weighted assets and reduced access to term liquidity, the third component of the shock, apparent since late autumn, has been some actual impairment of capital resources. Large banks especially have progressively written down the values of structured-finance assets, reflecting deterioration in the underlying position of the US household sector and in the values of a wide range of leveraged instruments. But the adjustment is drawn out, partly due to uncertainty about appropriate mark-to-market valuations given the impaired liquidity in ABS markets. To avoid this process amplifying the credit cycle,12 some replenishment of common equity may be needed, and has already begun.                                                   10  In a Modigliani-Miller world of perfect capital markets, a bank’s overall cost of funds is independent of its capital and funding structure. As a result the level of bank capital and the balance of wholesale and retail funding are not relevant to bank lending decisions and so do not affect the monetary transmission mechanism. 11  Bernanke, B. S. and C. S. Lown (1991), “The credit crunch”, Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, No. 2, pp. 204-39. 12  Ashcraft, A. B., and M. Campello (2002), “Borrowers' financial constraints and the transmission of monetary policy: evidence from financial conglomerates”, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Staff Reports: 153. BIS Review 149/2007 5 
The fourth element in the story, underway since August, has been distributional. Banks relatively reliant on wholesale funding have bid up for funds. But doing so has been taken as an adverse signal, prompting further rationing of wholesale money market lending at term maturities and potentially deterring the strong from entering the market; this is what is known as a “Lemons” problem13. In the United Kingdom, since August, mortgage approvals and secured lending have declined by more at the medium-sized mortgage banks and specialist lenders than at the largest UK banks, partly due to Northern Rock (Charts 14-15). This was symmetric. Their mortgage portfolios grew faster over the previous years. All told, this looks like a manifestation of the Kashyap and Stein finding, in various non-UK settings, that lending is more cyclically variable at banks that start off with weaker balance sheets;14 or, as I would prefer to put it, with concentrated income streams and/or funding sources. Won’t the macroeconomic effect of this be dampened by the bigger and more diversified banks picking up the slack? It is important to distinguish the longer term from the near term. The longer-term impact will depend on whether the structure of the industry shifts. The securitisation boom seems to have altered the terms of trade in UK banking for a while. By reducing reliance on retail deposits, it reduced barriers to entry. Lenders’ margins fell (Chart 16), and credit conditions in the UK mortgage market eased. Conversely, the painful reminder that undiversified funding and income sources may leave a bank unusually vulnerable will probably bring about another shock to the structure of the market. The persistent tightening in mortgage credit that that would bring was a factor in the MPC’s November projections.  In the near term, the extent to which the big or more diversified banks fill the gap will depend on the extent to which they too preserve capital and liquidity in the face of the harsh environment I have described.  Money, or bank intermediation  So far I have focused entirely on credit. Where does this leave money (or Money), the starting point for much traditional monetary analysis? Well, much that I have said about banks – their capacity, in the short run, to lever up their balance sheets and expand credit at will; their role in providing liquidity insurance to investment vehicles and corporates – turns precisely on their liabilities being money. And for this reason, banks are after all decisively different from other intermediaries.  As transactions balances and so the means of exchange in our payments system, the moneyness of bank deposits lies at the core of credit intermediation. Subject only but crucially to confidence in their soundness, banks extend credit by simply increasing the borrowing customer’s current account, which can be paid away to wherever the borrower wants by the bank “writing a cheque on itself”. That is, banks extend credit by creating money. This “money creation” process is constrained: by their need to manage the liquidity risk – from the withdrawal of deposits and the draw-down of back-up lines – to which it                                                  13  Akerlof, G. A. (1970), “The market for “lemons”: quality uncertainty and the market mechanism”, Quarterly Journal of Economics, Vol. 84, No. 3, pp. 488-500. A market for “lemons” issue arises when informational deficiencies give rise to uncertainty about the true quality of a product. In such circumstances, buyers choose to pay only average prices for goods that carry the risk of sellers overstating their true quality. As a result, sellers of good products, having little incentive to participate in such markets, are driven out by those sellers of poor quality products. The most common example of the problem is the market for used new cars. Rationing in the interbank markets is discussed by Freixas, X. and J. Jorge (2007) in “The role of interbank markets in monetary policy: a model with rationing”, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Economics Working Papers. 14  Kashyap, A. K. and J. C.

exposes them.15 Adequate capital and liquidity, including for stressed circumstances, are the essential ingredients for maintaining confidence.16  If that excursion into the realm of financial stability appears to have drifted away from the immediate issue of Money, it is because the health of bank balance sheets is relevant to both the demand for money and its supply, even if this is apparent only occasionally. Charles Goodhart has already, and very usefully, stressed the importance of recovering the notion of shocks to the supply of broad money.17 In the main, however, in terms of the underlying drivers, we are talking here of shifts in the supply of broad money caused by shocks to the supply of bank lending: banks create money by extending credit (Diagram C). And as discussed earlier, key drivers in terms of bank balance sheet growth include the variables that underpin bankers’ confidence in borrowers; and, conversely, confidence in banks themselves. It should come as no surprise that the “credit channel” macroeconomic literature converged with bankers in focusing on the tangible collateral available from borrowers, and on their own capital and liquidity (which includes the ex ante and ex post terms on which they have access to central bank reserves).  Some important things can be said about this account of shifts in the supply of broad money. First, in contrast to the textbook account of shocks to the Money supply via the proverbial helicopter drop of base money (pound notes), firms and households are not caught in a bind where, in aggregate, they are forced to hold the increased supply of broad money, even if it exceeds demand. Following a shock to the supply of credit, in which some people or companies become less credit constrained, it will be open to others to reduce their existing borrowing as the extra money circulates around the economy via the purchase of goods, services and financial assets.  Second, and more important, the shocks to credit supply are, in themselves, real not nominal shocks. And like other real shocks, causing changes in the balance of Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply, there is a nominal effect only if monetary policy does not respond via alterations to the path of short-term interest rates to keep the economy on a stable path and in line with the inflation target.  Absent an appropriate policy response, the easing in monetary conditions would in time feed into inflation through an expansion of nominal spending. In the first instance, the expansion of “liquidity” represented by faster money growth may sometimes work through asset prices. That is because with imperfect substitution between different kinds of financial assets, relative risk premia may be altered, which in turn may affect borrowing conditions in capital markets.18With an appropriate policy response, what should we expect to see in bank balance sheets, in broad money growth, following a credit-supply shock? It might be that the path for broad                                                  15  See Kashyap, A. K., R. Rajan and J.

BIS Review 149/2007 7 
money should be unaltered in the medium term. In other words, a persistent acceleration (or deceleration) of M4 would be indicative of a nominal shock, jeopardising achievement of the inflation target. The world is not so simple, however. The underlying drivers of the change in the supply of bank lending, and so in broad money, may also bring about shifts in the demand for money, validating a different level for real money balances – perhaps most obviously, if investment and so the economy’s productive capacity were affected. For some underlying shocks, it is probably better to think about the effects on banking intermediation rather than simply on bank lending. Faced with a change in their costs and opportunities, bankers might sometimes be able to adjust the terms on either their assets or their liabilities (or both). Currently, banks have incurred an adverse shock to their wholesale funding (Chart 17). The evidence so far suggests that, as well as tightening terms for borrowers, they are improving rates offered on retail deposits.  Where does that leave us on Money? It is clear enough from the long-run relationship between money growth and inflation that prolonged shifts in money growth can be an amber light (Chart 18). And possible liquidity effects mean that, through risk premia, shifts in the quantity of money may feed back into financial asset markets and so into broader credit conditions. But there are no “easy wins” when it comes to analysing Money demand and supply.19  Money and credit in the current conjuncture  Those challenges are certainly apparent right now. Judging from a combination of market intelligence, surveys and prices, there is no doubt that credit conditions for both households and firms have tightened materially. The Bank’s new Credit Conditions Survey, published for the first time in September, recorded a clear tightening in availability of credit to corporates over the previous quarter. A month later, a mini-survey unsurprisingly revealed tighter conditions for households too.20 Spreads on corporate and household credit are already higher across the board; and for risky borrowers, financing costs have risen notwithstanding the fall in risk-free yields.  Since August, the MPC has stressed, however, that it will not be sufficient in these circumstances to look solely at the price of credit, as there could be increased quantity rationing. The standard view is that households and small firms are more likely to be adversely affected in such circumstances than large firms, which typically have greater access to capital markets. But as this disturbance affected the wholesale loan markets, we will need to monitor conditions for corporate bond and loan issuance. Indeed, we will need to look at total credit, and carefully across different sectors to track the impact of the tightening. But timely and rich data are available on just bank lending. And interpreting them is not straightforward given the nature of the shock to the system. If reintermediation is significant, banks will be taking back on to their balance sheets conduit and investment vehicle paper or just holding onto loans for longer than usual before they can be sold onto the capital markets.                                                  19  Perhaps nothing illustrates this as cleanly as the advent of credit derivatives. Derivatives of any kind unbundle funding (and so liquidity risk) from the underlying risk to which an agent is seeking exposure via a particular contract. So a credit derivative unbundles credit risk from funding. This further complicates interpretation of the bank lending data (M4L). Imagine that, due to their customer networks and screening capability, banks originate all credit, but that they use credit-default swaps to shed a great portion of the credit risk via CDS to non-bank financial institutions. In the limit, this would be a world in which M4L correctly measured (bank) lending and M4 was one useful measure of “liquidity”. But it would also be a world in which shocks to credit conditions from capital and risk appetite worked largely through non-bank lenders, and in which shocks to liquidity worked largely through depositor confidence in the banking system. In the real world, this story underlines the need to look at total credit, and to analyse the monetary data with finesse. 20  See Bank of England Inflation Report, November 2007, Section 1 on “Money and Asset Prices”, pages 16-17. 8 BIS Review 149/2007 
It cannot be ruled out that, for a while, the M4L growth rate may deceive as to the underlying pace of credit expansion in the economy.  That is important because, in a nutshell, the turmoil in financial markets is not just a “City” event. How potent it will be macroeconomically will depend on how long current conditions persist, and the feedback loop between the financial economy and the real economy. As to its persistence, necessary conditions for an alleviation of the current strains in credit markets are probably at least twofold. First, that the US housing and household debt markets stabilise. Second, that banks and other financial intermediaries recognise impairments to asset values, so that uncertainties about counterparty credit risks begin to reduce.  On the financial-real economy interaction, we must try to avoid a vicious circle in which tighter liquidity conditions, lower asset values, impaired capital resources, reduced credit supply, and slower aggregate demand feed back on each other. A variety of policy responses are possible. The announcement yesterday by central banks of co-ordinated action via term auctions to alleviate pressure in financing markets is directed at that. Second, regulatory authorities around the world are monitoring banks’ liquidity and capital positions, including in the context of Basel II. And, thirdly, monetary policy also can in principle play a role, through what is effectively a “financial accelerator” working through bank balance sheets, where that is consistent with maintaining stable inflation in the medium term. In the UK, the starting point has been robust domestic demand; the leveraged-buyout sector aside, generally healthy corporate balance sheets; somewhat more vulnerable household balance sheets;21 and potentially stretched commercial and residential property prices.  At the Committee’s November meeting, I explored the case for an “insurance cut” addressed to the downside risks from tightening credit conditions. The case for such a cut was strengthened by Bank Rate, at 5¾%, standing at a level that was most probably mildly restrictive. But that had to be weighed against the upward pressures on inflation stemming largely from the rise in energy and other commodity prices. Our November projections seemed to me likely to validate the expectation already embodied in the money market curve that Bank Rate would over time be lowered, representing some offset to the tightening in liquidity and credit premia. That being so, on balance, I concluded that an immediate cut was not necessary; and that “no change” would give the Committee a valuable opportunity to explain in the Inflation Report the implications of both the credit and commodity shocks, underlining that the Committee remains focused on anchoring inflation expectations and so achieving the inflation target over the medium term. Looking ahead, I noted the importance of distinguishing between, on the one hand, the passing through into the macroeconomy of the shocks that had already occurred to credit conditions and to commodity prices; and, on the other hand, the possibility of new shocks on either or both fronts.  That was my starting point for our December meeting, the minutes of which will be published next week.  Summary and conclusions  Let me try to pull together some of my central themes.                                                  21  “…households have increased their debt….more debt unavoidably leaves them more vulnerable to bad luck, eg adverse economic shocks”, Tucker, P. M. W. (2003), “Credit conditions and monetary policy”, speech at the Leeds Financial Services Initiative, Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, Autumn 2003, p. 373. BIS Review 149/2007 9 
I have stressed that we should take care to avoid talking about money when we mean credit. In a similar spirit, we should be clear when we mean total credit and when bank lending, but without assuming the two are divorced. I have also stressed the need for attention to the underlying drivers of credit conditions throughout the economic cycle. In today’s financial system, we may well need richer data on credit quantities and flows outside the banking sector, perhaps along the lines of the US Flow of Funds statistics. The Bank’s new Credit Conditions Survey is also designed to give us better qualitative information to put alongside the quantity and price data. Even so, as with asset prices more generally, we will sometimes find it hard to distinguish between changes in credit conditions warranted by fundamentals and those that are not. Failure to recognise fundamentally warranted and sustainable shifts would deplete welfare. But it is distinctly uncomfortable for the world’s central banks to rely entirely on mopping up after a bubble bursts: one imbalance can lead to another.22 The central banking community does not yet have a satisfactory way through this dilemma.  And Money? It occupies one end of the liquidity spectrum, and so changes in the quantity of money might potentially affect risk premia, and so credit conditions more generally. Gauging that is a formidable challenge. As an input to policy, there is just no alternative to getting one’s hands dirty in analysing the monetary data. With an institutional rather than functional definition of broad money, special care is needed not to be misled by shifts in the demand for money from the plethora of non-bank financial institutions. This is important if we are to use money as an indicator of nominal trends alongside survey and financial-market-based measures of inflation expectations.  That brings me back to where I began: with our policy reaction function. Occasionally the markets will be surprised by our policy decisions. But we should do all we can to avoid confusion about how we think about the economy and about monetary policy strategy. In the spring, my own view of the signals from broad money had not altered materially. So today I have tried to explain how I think about money, credit and the connections between them. That has provided a framework for some observations on the current conjuncture, underlining the need for careful attention to conditions in the banking system. Central banks should be, and need to be, well placed to undertake that analysis, which has rarely been more important than now.                                                   22  I argued this in Tucker, P. M. W. (2006), “Reflections on operating inflation targeting”, speech at the Chicago Graduate School of Business, Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, Summer 2006, p. 220. 10 BIS Review 149/2007

Zhou Xiaochuan: Instability and evolution of the financial system Speech by Mr Zhou Xiaochuan, Governor of the People’s Bank of China, at the "Global Management Forum" organized by Qing Hua University, Beijing, 30 October 2007.  *      *      * Financial instability or turbulences occur every few years. As it is almost impossible to avoid mistakes completely, the key is to learn how to live with the instability or turbulences, and consequently draw lessons to improve the financial system.  The recently concluded 17th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) stressed the objective of keeping the momentum of good and fast economic growth. That means, in the financial sector, we should do our best to prevent financial instability or turbulence. The recent subprime turbulence has created fairly large disruptions in financial markets in the U.S. and the world at large, and consequently put China on high alert. For the past five years, China's economy has basically maintained a steady and rapid growth without any real bumps. In fact, I am a bit worried that some young people may think that this kind of smooth, stable status is normal. In fact, the more likely norm is that a financial system faces instability or turbulences of varying degree every few years; free from all such instability would be, in fact, abnormal. What's important to realize is that all economic distress including the current subprime turbulence, contain within themselves valuable lessons worthy of discovery and scrutiny. Indeed, these lessons can serve as an important source of insight for China as it improves and develops financial markets and macroeconomic policy-making. Financial instability or turbulences are not unusual  The financial markets in the U.S., the most developed in the world, have experienced turbulence and distress one after another in the past decades. In the 1970s, there was a high inflation; in the 1980s, the S&L crisis occurred and prompted the authorities to create a Resolution Trust Corporation around 1990 to deal with the consequences of the crisis. In 1987, the stock market crashed on Black Monday; in autumn 1998, as the financial crisis in Asia spread to Russia and Brazil, the collapse of Long Term Capital Management triggered a distress; in 2000, enormous amount of wealth evaporated as a result of burst bubbles in the NASDAQ market; after this, the Enron and WorldCom scandals shook the securities market in 2002; and most recently, this year has seen an ongoing subprime turbulence.  Instability or turbulences have occurred in succession. Each is caused by as yet unidentified mistakes. As mistakes are unavoidable, the key is to learn how to live with the instability or turbulences, and consequently draw lessons to improve the financial system. As a matter of fact, the financial authorities have introduced significant and substantive policy or institutional improvements after every crisis.  By reviewing the above-mentioned turbulences in the U.S., we get a rough idea of how improvements have occurred. In the period of high inflation through 1970s and 80s, the role, independence and governance of the central bank were carefully studied. As a result, operations of the central bank made lots of improvements. We can read about these developments in the biography of Paul Volker and the autobiography of Alan Greenspan. After the Black Monday in 1987, it became known to the general public how the central bank used liquidity management in a flexible manner in response to the crisis that might otherwise spread quickly. After the S&L crisis between 1980 and early 1990s was resolved, the regulators carefully examined the potential moral hazard in the deposit insurance scheme. In 1991, the Federal Deposit Insurance Company Improvement Act was adopted to strengthen BIS Review 148/2007 1 
the supervision function of the FDIC, establish an arrangement for prompt corrective actions and adopt differentiated premiums to mitigate adverse selection and moral hazards. After the Long Term Capital Management problem, the financial sector watched the leverage ratio of hedge funds more carefully and urged commercial institutions, commercial banks in particular, to strengthen internal control over the leverage ratio. With the burst of NASDAQ bubbles, people began to get a taste of bubbles and their harms. In the aftermath of Enron and WorldCom scandals, Sarbanes-Oxley Act was passed. Though some may view a small number of its codes as over reaction, the Act contains remarkable improvements in response to the problems of the listed companies. A lot of reflection has been seen in the recent turbulence triggered by subprime mortgage. As we usually say in China, there is a good chance of turning bad things into good ones.  Parsing China's experience Looking back at China's economic and financial development since the period of opening up and reform, a similar picture emerges in which we could see financial distresses, big or small, always occurred.  In 1985, China experienced a high inflation rate of 8.8 percent. In the anti-inflation process, the decision-makers learned how to build a two-tier banking system. The blind optimism about the balance of payments existed at that time was also corrected in this process. The high inflation rate recorded in 1988 was a result of several factors, including a so-called theory of “harmless inflation ” that had been influential in 1987-1988. After 1988, this view fell completely out of favor.  The next round of inflation, starting in 1993, caused the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee to lay out a formal macroeconomic policy framework as well as various guiding perceptions and principles, including what kind of macroeconomic policy framework should be established? What is the role of the fiscal policy? What is the role of the monetary policy? What exactly is government plan attempting to coordinate? Based on these deliberations, the macroeconomic policy-making has improved significantly, and we have also learned how to apply economic leverages appropriately and timely, and how to deal with the inflation. Through the 1990s, the Chinese banking sector faced a predicament characterized by the underdevelopment of a sound “credit culture.” During this period, shortcomings of the credit culture were exemplified by two main types of bank lending. The first was policy lending, including those determined by the government plan or under variety of administrative interventions. The second was so-called “relationship-based lending”. At that time, there existed large deficiencies in the standards of accounting, information disclosure and financial statements reporting. Enterprises’ access to credit was largely based on their management’s personal relationship to the banks, and only those with good relationship got the loans. Rectifying China’s unsound credit culture has been a long and painful process. A key step on this path was the nation’s first National Financial Work Conference held in November 1997, which set out a vertical management system for the commercial banks. Both the central and local governments were thus prohibited from interfering with loan decisions. This change was considered an important step forward in transforming the credit culture.  At the end of 1997, the Asian financial crisis spread to its full scale. Although China averted a head-on hit by the crisis, its aftermath had produced long-term effects on the Chinese economy, including, most obviously, the problem of non-performing loans (NPLs). According to accounting standards used domestically at that time, in 1998 the Chinese banking system had an NPL ratio of 25 percent, although international accounting standards would have put the rate as high as more than 40 percent – a figure underscoring a NPL crisis. Indeed, many banks were technically insolvent. A banking system in such a status would be difficult to support a sound economic development. Such a reality buttressed China’s resolve to carry out reforms. 2 BIS Review 148/2007 
In February 2002, at the second National Financial Work Conference, plans were made to strengthen financial supervision (later on in 2003 the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) was established). It was also decided to kick off a new round of reforms on the commercial banking sector, clean up bank balance sheets, and proceed with financial restructuring – measures designed to make major commercial banks to be financially healthy. Over the next five years, China carried out a series of reforms on the financial institutions, including not only the commercial banks, but also the rural credit unions and other financial institutions, such as security firms and insurance companies. The decision to carry out reforms was the result of lessons learned, and it also laid a foundation for future development. Just before the Enron and WorldCom cases were exposed in the United States, the Chinese media had unveiled a fund scandal in its securities trading. In this case, some institutions were found of manipulating stock prices. The year 2001 also saw the Yin Guang Xia case, which was similar to the Enron scandal in that the listed company disclosed false information and engaged in unlawful trading in its stock. In 2003, a larger scandal of listed company broke out with the collapse of the De Long Conglomerate. Following these incidents, China’s financial regulations and corporate governance standards were improved and toughened to counteract the misconducts by using complex corporate structures, which occurred in the De Long Case. China’s financial system is thus gradually improving its knowledge to deal with instability or turbulences of varying degrees. While it’s difficult to avoid mistakes completely, the key is to learn the right lessons, make improvements, and achieve substantive progress.  A Chinese saying goes like this “if you frequently suffer minor illnesses, you may be finally exempted from a major disease”. China must avoid at all costs the kind of disease that plagued Japan’s economy through the 1990s and even into the new century. The mirror image In reviewing international financial instability or turbulences since the 1970s, we may have two observations. First, while many kinds of instability or turbulences afflict financial systems, only minority is created by the financial system itself. The majority reflects problems in the real economy – the so-called “mirror image” in financial sector. The real economy and the financial system mirror each other, such as NPL problem usually reflects troubles with firms in the real economy. At the same time, it may also reflect problems in accounting practice, information disclosure, and corporate governance. One characteristic of the modern economy is that the financial system is a barometer for the entire economy: troubles in the real economy are often first broken out in the financial system. Problems in the financial system, however, are not caused by the financial system alone. Second, problems in developed countries, particularly in those emerged in mature market economies, are often relatively new as these economies are often places where financial innovation activities are concentrated. These problems are so new that market participants and regulators alike have a hard time predicting their course. Naturally, it’s a big challenge to find solutions. In comparison, problems faced by the emerging markets or developing countries are more often a repeat of those already experienced by the developed economies. Thus, the way for dealing with instability often can more probably be drawn from the international historical experience. Rethinking financial instability or turbulences  First, if an economic system or policies are flawed, sooner or later they will be forced to be corrected; this is an objective law in the functioning of the market economy. The US BIS Review 148/2007 3 
subprime turbulence is a clear case. Individuals without sufficient ability to repay and failing to meet loan standards were nonetheless given large amount of home loans. At some point, such hidden risks would have to surface. When an obvious bubble forms in an economy, bursting problems are bound to emerge with time. Second, risks to the financial system brought by indirect financing are much higher than those tied to direct financing. So we say “debt is more dangerous”. Institutional investors including pension funds, mutual funds, hedge funds, private equity funds, etc, presumably know and undertake relevant risks inherent in the investment. Problems that arise are thus comparatively less painful to be absorbed. A recent estimate of the amount of the subprime mortgage securities is about US$ 200 billion. If these risks are truly spread among the institutional investors and other direct investors, it should not be so hard for an economy as large as the U.S. to absorb the losses (all the more so given some of the burden will fall on Europe, Japan and even, to a much less extent, China). So why, against most expectations, did this turbulence continue spreading? An understanding lies in the fact that while some of the investment risk was carried by direct investors, certain risks were in fact left within the indirect financing channels. As we know, these are the so-called structured investment vehicles (SIVs), which are often off-balance-sheets of banks and other financial institutions. Financial institutions kept a huge amount of debt exposure off their books – without being detected by the regulatory bodies. Off-book supervision has actually been rather relaxed, and many people including the regulators even don’t necessarily have relevant experience in this field. Because these off-book investment institutions usually borrowed from the banks, in the end commercial banks were left holding a sizeable portion of subprime and its derivative products. The Basel II banking guidelines set requirements for debtors to bring certain off-book services back on-book in a timely manner. But most banks, with the exception of those large European banks, have not yet taken these guidelines. And the Chinese banks are currently not subject to the Basel II.  As long as the banking system doesn’t get dragged into the mess, the subprime mortgage problems would only have limited impact. As far as direct investment risk is concerned, investors will have to absorb their losses, and central banks generally would not stand to provide support. As for debt risk within the banks that bear systemic implications, actions have to be taken to curb its spread. As illustrated in Northern Rock case when the drying up of market liquidity begins and threatens to spread, the bank of England must act. Reviewing the debt instruments, we learn that the creditor-debtor relationships imply greater systematic risks. Similar cases can be found by reviewing lessons from the Asian financial crisis and the Japanese experience. To reduce risk and increase financial stability, great effort should be made to develop direct financing. However, it’s vital that direct investment products are not twisted to simply shift the risk back to the banking system. In such a process, the key is to foster and develop investors, including institutional investors as well as individual investors, who can recognize specific risk and have the ability to undertake risks.  Third, analyses and research should be strengthened to detect bubble risks and prepare for different scenarios. A book called Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds describes the bubbles of early years of western financial markets. The title of the book is interesting because it reminds participants in the financial markets to keep rational. When the market goes to overheat, participants often see their reasoning weakened and even many of them try to explain away or defend such irrationality. During his tenure at the U.S. Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan used the term “irrational exuberance” to alert the overheated situation. This, too, was a reminder that a more rational attitude should be maintained in the process of economic and market overheating.  Fourth, in the process of diagnosing problems and prescribing solutions, it’s important not to misread history. When making corrections, efforts should be exercised to avoid overshooting, lest such efforts end up sowing the seeds for another crisis. Among the analyses of the current state of global excess liquidity and the US subprime turbulence, one line of thinking 4 BIS Review 148/2007 
draws its origins from the Fed loosening monetary policy following the bursting of the NASDAQ bubble in 2000. Amid the large amount of analysis about the spillover effects of the subprime turbulence on China, some have voiced cautions about the development of securitized products, and traced the origins of the subprime turbulence to the development of these securitized products and other derivatives. Worrying that more complex product might generate greater troubles, these embrace a vision of “simpler is better.” But we need to remain sober: the securitization process should not be jettisoned quickly. To develop financial market and support economic growth, resolute efforts need to be made to develop direct financing and related securitization. It is almost impossible to avoid securitization in the contemporary development. Rather, great efforts should be made to develop an array of financial products, including the hybrid products such as debt-equity mixed and some derivatives. We need to recognize that problems arise not because the securitization or derivatives as a product are somehow flawed. Instead, most of these troubles result from problems in information disclosure or the pricing mechanisms, or because the design of the mechanisms implied moral hazard. Fifth, flexibility and adaptability must be improved. In dealing with the crisis it’s important to realize the fluidity of the situation and thus the need for a nimble response. The Governor of the Bank of England was criticized for his response to the Northern Rock on the floor of Parliament, where he was blamed of changing his position over a few days. In fact, financial markets are fast changing, and judgments must be made according to specific conditions. It’s normal for one’s conclusions to be updated within a few days. From the perspective of the adjustment capabilities in dealing with the crisis, the key is to increase microeconomic flexibility. In other words, the adaptability of the micro entities to changes in prices as well as in market supply-demand should all be improved, thus avoiding the introduction of excess rigidity in pricing, supply, demand, and institutional design. Sixth, to guard against and manage instability, developing countries must raise levels of confidence in their currencies, markets and central banks. Key points here include maintaining the stability of currency value, adopting a flexible exchange rate policy, supporting confidence in currency convertibility, increasing the economy’s ability to deal with all kinds of shocks, and exercising regular assessment of the economy, so as to provide early warning about risks forming within the economy, and research and prepare contingency plans. IMF’s annual surveillance mechanism – including the “Article IV Consultation” – functions as an effective tool for regular health check-up of the member economies.  Seventh, it’s truly an art to find the subtle balance needed for anti-crisis policy-making. It’s important to avoid creating too much moral hazard by bailing out institutions whose own operations lead to major mistakes. At the same time, it’s necessary to consider the impact on the real economy: if a crisis impact on the real economy and social confidence are severe, or it may result in a system-wide chain reaction, a prompt action would be required. Of course, the reactions will vary under different circumstances. As the subprime mortgage crisis develops, we are carefully observing two recent policies. First, about 2 million American subprime home loan recipients face their problem to fully repay their mortgages. If foreclosure is enforced, it may lead to further declines of the housing prices. During the process, the government may wish to take steps to help poor people through their difficulties. But the fundamental issue is that people who didn’t meet loan conditions probably should not have bought such large houses. Will the government’s provision of aid or subsidies lead to moral hazard? Should the resulted loss be borne by the taxpayers? Second, some US (as well as a handful of European) financial institutions employed SIVs or other conduits to take on additional risk exposure. Should these institutions be bailed out? Several big US banks have recently created a “super conduit” worth US$ 75 billion, trying to help alleviate the crisis. But in so doing, how it is going to price the risk of related products? Will this simply create even greater moral hazard? BIS Review 148/2007 5 
Above all, we need to pay close attention to and deeply think about the turbulence underway as well as the remedial measures adopted by the financial regulatory authorities in the mature economies to deal with it. Such a reflection bears great significance for China to develop its financial market, improve financial supervision and regulation and macroeconomic policy-making. 6 BIS Review 148/2007 
Rundheersing Bheenick: Bank of Mauritius – 40th anniversary year highlights and outlook Speech by Professor Rundheersing Bheenick, Governor of the Bank of Mauritius, at the dinner to mark the conclusion of the 40th Anniversary celebrations of the Bank of Mauritius, Port Louis, 6 December 2007. *      *      * “Our revels now are ended…” The Vice-president and our guest of honour; former Vice-presidents; Former Deputy Prime Ministers; Ministers; Former Ministers; Excellencies members of the Diplomatic Corps; Honourable Governor of the Bank of Ghana Dr Paul Acquah, our special guest this evening; Members of the Board of the Bank of Mauritius, Chairman of the Mauritius Bankers’ Association; Chairman of the Joint Economic Council; Deputy Speaker; Honourable Members of Parliament; Mayors and Chairmen of District Councils, Members of the Press, Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen: The first necessity for good speaking is a goodly audience: and I must say we certainly have that tonight! I am delighted that we have with us on this occasion our special guest Dr Paul Acquah Governor of the Bank of Ghana. We are here for the finale of the celebrations of the 40th anniversary year of the Bank of Mauritius. I should add our congratulations to the Mauritius Bankers’ Association, who are with us in strength tonight, also in their 40th year. At our opening banquet, we dwelt on the milestones we have passed since those heady days of Independence and the opening of this Bank, as part of the process of shedding the mantle of Colonial times. Tonight I will focus on the fresh developments of this 40th year itself, with just a glance into the crystal ball of years ahead. There are quite some tasks that confront us to secure a sure sustainability for banking into the future. We hover still in a shadow of the looming clouds, of recent months, from the global credit crisis unfolding from the US sub-prime debacle. Dr Reddy our good friend from the Reserve Bank of India has emphasised the uncertainties in the unstable state of banking. These are nothing less than a climate change for us. They are the inescapable shifting of the tectonic plates of global trade. We shall be seeing the west, and even the “green back” as a global currency, recede, and the Asian giants move in. For the present, let me say, 2007 has been not just a year of celebration, but a year of real progress and development in banking in this country. In reviewing this year of real progress, so far, I shall touch on: • The formal institutional developments, • The internal light re-engineering or restructuring, • Our new relationships with stakeholders, and • Some of the events in our pageant of 40th anniversary year celebrations. Institutional developments Allow me to list a few of the critical institutional reforms that have already changed the pattern of our work together. For the first time in our history, we have a Monetary Policy Committee, which, with its new independence, will ensure a more adaptive capacity for determining the best monetary interests for the country. We have had the Amendment to the Banking Act, which gives the MPC decisive powers. We have instituted a new departure in communications policy that ensures that, you know as much as we do, about both the BIS Review 148/2007 1 
decisions and the analysis. Yesterday, in our fifth meeting, we came to an historic decision on interest rates, by unanimous vote: BUSINESS AS USUAL; no change! For those new to these matters, I must confirm that it is not a requirement that the members of the MPC are signed up adherents to Monetarist theory. We have a more liberal perspective here; rather taking the view that Monetarism, like Marxism, has suffered the only fate for a theory worse than death; it was, for a time, put into practice. History teaches us that men and nations behave wisely once they have exhausted all other alternatives. What worries me, and I guess most other bankers, is that when great men get drunk with theory, it is the little men who wake up with the headache. We now have a new formal accord on our complementary functions with the Financial Services Commission the FSC. This will I believe set a new tone for harmonious co-operation between the several actors in promoting safe more efficient and stable leadership and management in the sector. This accord is the start of a journey we are making, together. It is not a final destination we have already attained. We are passing through a tense period globally in the supervision of banking and credit. There are compelling reasons to take stock now. So we have made an important step in establishing this new accord on our relative roles in supervision of the ownership structure, corporate governance and risk management. It is this latter field that has been in the sharp focus of worldwide concern, starting with the so-called sub-prime market in the US. This has not been a local storm in a tea-cup, but a tsunami rapidly engulfing not just the core activities of a few institutions in one region. It is surging across the oceans. It is submerging the interlinked archipelago of loosely affiliated entities, subject to varying degrees of regulation. Some of the regulatory links are so obscure and vulnerable to the sea level rise they have been quickly overwhelmed. Central banks, and even governments, have had to mount rescue operations, at unusually sympathetic rates, at great financial cost and at even greater moral hazard. I trust that this new accord with the FSC will help us here to tighten our controls and limit the risk arising from such supervisory gaps. The accord with the FSC is based on international best practice, commended by international bodies and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. This joint BOM/FSC committee will ensure continuity of monitoring and partnership. Yet uncertainty of the underlying risks remains. However confident we are in our institutional strengths, we must beware of that notion of progress which mistakes comfort for invulnerability. We must be rethinking the instruments of monetary policy. This is essential as we move, slowly but surely forward, into the higher realms of financial globalisation and the process of regional economic, financial and monetary union. As we move into closer union in Africa, we shall continue to work with all our international partners, western and eastern. Although I suppose we have to admit the Europeans remain our best of friends, in terms of markets for our exports products and services. Now for a little light re-engineering Now let me pass on to our little light engineering, here at the Bank. We are not only moving into our new building, but at the same time undertaking some modest reform of our internal organisational structure and processes. In the past in Mauritius we have come to rely on a time lag of some years between the perception that something ought to be done, and any serious attempt to do it. We have dared to reduce this lag to months, even weeks in some cases. I am glad to say that all the staff have collaborated well. We have encountered little of the paradox of reform where the office becomes a hotbed of cold feet. In all this we have been greatly assisted by a fine Malaysian expert review team, who have brought both fresh ideas and a new stimulus to the continual process of adaptation to our changing market in banking and to the changing needs and 2 BIS Review 148/2007 
perspectives of government. We now have a flatter structure, sloughing off some of that cellulite, producing a faster more relevant response to the needs of our times and customers. We are seeing meetings more as means of resolving issues rather than just continually restating them. We look to very positive results from our new Communications Division, with a fresh vision drawn from the wider realms of the media and communications practice. Our mission is to transform the Bank of Mauritius into the People’s Bank. We have a new Corporate Services Division with a knowledge-management function as its core discipline. One new focus will be on applied teaching and research with the University, to foster our sustained adaptation in the face of the global financial, commercial and economic climate change. We have marked this with a series of five open lectures on banking, applied economics and monetary policy, which should become a staple part of our diet in years to come. Our new relationships with stakeholders Let me now pass to our improving relationship with our stakeholders, many of whom, I am delighted to see here tonight. I am also pleased to say how constructive the new Banking Committee meeting is emerging. It is a new breeze in our more open relationship with our stakeholders. We have had a series of refreshing meetings. These meetings have developed into a series of consultations with private sector stakeholders. Through them you are airing your prevailing concerns and we are learning how better to gauge your perceptions on key issues, and the ways in which a central Bank can best respond. We have touched on such trends in the main macroeconomic indicators, labour market developments, access to finance and the nature and impact of the main constraints that you face in getting on with business. These consultations have involved the chambers of commerce, merchants, export associations, the tourist industry, shop owners, consumers’ representatives, maritime agents, insurers and those in the agriculture and in the transport sectors amongst others. Issues raised at these meetings have ranged widely from globalisation, banking practices, bank charges, security of on-line transactions, cyber-crime, varied levels of competitiveness, transparency of exchange rates, effectiveness of the sme partnership fund, widening the participation in the sme’s chamber, communications and the heavy technical content of our traditional Bulletin and other reports, the role of the new Communications Director and how best to tap into the intelligence, vigour, resilience and leverage of the private sector. We have been exploring benchmarks for performance, efficiency and, may I add, inefficiency, the profitability of banks at the expense of customers, variation in bank charges, re-investment rates in companies, development of Mauritius as a duty free island, and the time taken to process cheques. These are not meetings for taking votes. They are more important than that. For they give airtime to the softest voices. I have always had a sneaking feeling, you know, that in the long run, we discover that the minorities with the softest voices are almost always right. This open approach to our consultative meetings has been extended to our over-the-counter banking; more open than ever this year. This is a trend sweeping though the banking sector in general. 40th year celebrations Now let me briefly take you through the highlights of our anniversary year. This has served as a celebration of the wisdom and courage of our founders, a rite of passage into a new era in banking, and a preparation for the difficult journey ahead. I have been immensely grateful BIS Review 148/2007 3 
to the staff past and present who have put so much of themselves into each of these unfolding events. We began with a gala dinner with the great and the good, at which we received expressions of most generous support from the Prime Minister, from the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, and from our colleagues and friends in the banking and business community, many of whom are also with us tonight. I was particularly delighted that De La Rue’s were represented here. That is a link to this country that goes back over 150 years. Our new building has been formally opened and we are gradually becoming accustomed to its special architectural features and added security measures. Staff and their families greatly appreciated the inter-faith ceremony and blessings for their work, from the leaders of many religious communities, who graced that occasion with prayers and hymns of praise. Amongst other celebratory events this year, were: • The interclub youth athletics tournament, • A health week, • The launching the new Rs20 coin, • The issue of a Commemorative Rs 200 coin, • The design competition for the new bank notes, • The Charity night for Epilepsy and Alzheimer Associations, and • The opening of the ecological bamboo garden. Revisiting the future Finally, as we close our anniversary celebrations, we must look into the future and work towards the accomplishment of a new era for banking. Another forty years takes us beyond 2020; into Vision 20-20 +. The prime requirements for us will be to nurture a strong adaptive capacity, and a healthy appetite for problem solving. Seven years ago the technical version of the 20-20 vision document, Into the 3rd Millennium,1 referred to the past decades, as a story of unmitigated success. Then we put in a note of caution: “But peel away the layers of this remarkable success and there are immense challenges ahead to be overcome if growth is to be achieved and sustained…” How right we were to sound the early warning! Sustainable development is not easy; it really is post-graduate philosophy, politics and economics, especially for a small island developing state. I have been a lifelong socialist with a strong affinity to the Gini-coefficient. A long way back socialists thought that making a profit was a vice: whereas the real vice, in the pursuit of sustainable development, is making a loss, especially a loss of capital and of natural resources. In 1989 The World Bank referred to Mauritius as a “miracle of development”: the worry now is that the genie has retired back into the bottle, and in the meantime we seem to have forgotten the trick of rubbing.                                                  1  Ministry of Economic Planning and Development (2000) Into the 3rd Millennium, Government of Mauritius. 4 BIS Review 148/2007 
I am encouraged therefore to see that youth is on our side. For I observe that the number of Mauritian students registered in Tertiary education has increased from the year 2005 to 2006 by 15%. with a gross enrolment rate of nearly 20%. To keep pace with our competitors the target for the enrolment rate is to exceed 30%. That is the benchmark already achieved by our competitor countries. The overall increase in students in the finance sector in the year was 14%, which broadly matched the general increase of 15% in total tertiary students. But in banking the increase in registered students in the year was 32%, double the general trend. I hope they all have their sights on our jobs. We must ensure the banking doors are open wide to the best of them. We together as a sector must eagerly respond to their commitment. We must see more and more careers open to merit. High performance must bring financial rewards and accelerated advancement. We need to cherish the vigour and ideas of each new generation. We must no longer overwhelm the vitality of youth with stifling traditional procedure-based management. A key to our very sustained survival in the next four decades is working with the lighter feet of youth. Rapid response is not only relevant to survival from marine tsunamis. I have to say I am impressed by the changing culture of our banking world today. I sense a new eagerness to explore the future with new vigour, armed with fresh ideas. The curtain As we draw the curtain on our anniversary pageants, I am reminded of that Shakespearian scene, with Prospero, on the desert island in his exile, entertained by ethereal figures from legends past, Juno and the goddesses, in bright illuminated revelling. “Our revels now are ended,” he declares, “These our actors were all spirits… We are such stuff as dreams are made on and our little life Is ended with a sleep.” The Tempest past, his exile from the affairs of state is over. Now reality resumes. And so it is for us. But are we equipped, skilled and wise enough to grasp this opportunity and accept the challenge of the future? Together we must grasp the realities afresh. This is the 40th year of our celebrations in Banking; next year it is the nation itself that will be looking back on its record since Independence. With renewed vigour we must recommit ourselves to further progress in all sectors. We must value and enhance the outstanding but fragile natural beauty of this land, as our ultimate source of wealth. We must explore and more effectively play our role in the wider regions, to which we adhere, in the years to come. Only then can we turn to those, who have with so much courage, laid the foundations of banking here in the last forty years, and say to them, we have worthily followed your lead. Thank you.

Ric Battellino: Challenges and opportunities for the funds management industry in Australia Opening remarks by Mr Ric Battellino, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to the 20th Australasian Finance and Banking Conference, Sydney, 12 December 2007. *      *      * Introduction It is a pleasure to be here to open the 20th Australasian Finance and Banking Conference. Over the past twenty years, the Conference has provided a stimulating forum for discussion of a wide range of issues facing the banking and finance industry, and it has played an important role in helping to promote Australia as a major financial centre. I’m sure this year will be no exception. This morning’s Business Forum on the challenges and opportunities for the funds management industry has already generated a number of interesting points for discussion. The schedule for the next two and a half days will take the discussion into a broader range of topics in the field of banking and finance but for the moment I will focus my remarks on the funds management industry. Industry size Let me begin by recapping some facts on the size and growth of the industry. As we have heard, the funds management industry in Australia has expanded at a remarkable pace over the past couple of decades. Since 1990, the value of funds under management has grown at an annualised rate of 12½ per cent, and now stands at around $1.7 trillion. This is equivalent to about 160 per cent of GDP, up from about 50 per cent in 1990. By international standards, Australia’s funds management industry is among the largest in the world, not only as a ratio to GDP but also in absolute terms. Some reports rank Australia as the fourth largest funds management industry in the world in terms of assets under management. The data underlying this ranking are compiled by the Investment Company Institute, an industry association for US mutual funds. This measure covers investments in mutual funds and unit trusts, and therefore favours countries such as Australia where this type of investment vehicle is quite common. On the other hand, it understates the size of the funds management industry in countries that tend to use other investment structures. An alternative approach for measuring the size of the funds management industry is to add up all of the assets of pension funds, life insurance companies and other managed investments, regardless of the precise legal structure in which they reside. This provides a broader view of the funds management industry and one that is more comparable across countries. This exercise is not straightforward, however, as consistent international data are difficult to obtain.  After taking into account some of these measurement issues, my colleagues at the Bank estimate that the Australian industry is among the world’s ten largest, though more likely towards the bottom of this group than in the top half. It is difficult to be more precise than this but, nonetheless, it is clear that the Australian funds management industry is large by international standards. BIS Review 148/2007 1 
Reasons for growth What has been behind this rapid expansion in the industry? A large part of the growth over the past couple of decades has been due to superannuation. Superannuation fund assets have grown by an average of 14½ per cent per annum since 1990, and now comprise about half the funds under management in Australia. This rise in superannuation assets reflects a number of government initiatives, such as the introduction of compulsory superannuation contributions in the early 1990s and the concessional taxation of superannuation. Other parts of the funds management industry, however, have also grown quickly, reflecting more general reasons such as the increased financial awareness of households and the associated search for higher returns than those offered by traditional investments such as bank deposits; the strength of world equity markets; and the demographic trend of “baby boomers” entering the wealth-accumulation phase of their lives. As well as investing in what might be considered to be fairly conventional financial products, it is also notable that in Australia there has been significant direct participation by retail investors in the markets for sophisticated financial products. For example, retail and high net worth investors account for about two-thirds of the assets of Australian-based hedge funds, compared with less than half globally. The available evidence for Australia also suggests a larger retail presence in the market for collateralised debt obligations than is the case in other markets. Over the past five years, retail investors are estimated to have purchased around 15 per cent of the CDOs issued in Australia. One of the reasons for this higher participation by Australian retail investors in these markets is that the regulatory regime in Australia does not restrict retail access to any financial products as long as the provider meets certain disclosure requirements. This approach has been beneficial in terms of providing investors with a greater range of wealth-generating opportunities, but it does raise some important challenges. I want to spend the rest of my time today outlining these and other challenges facing the funds management industry. Challenges One of the most important challenges raised by a disclosure-based regime is that it places a significant premium on financial literacy. This is because it relies heavily on the ability of investors to understand the information that is presented to them and make appropriate decisions based on that information. Some retail investors may not be in this position. A particularly telling statistic comes from a recent survey conducted by the Financial Literacy Foundation, in which only about a third of adult respondents indicated that they considered both risk and return when choosing an investment. The fact that some retail investors had apparently devoted the bulk of their savings to buying unsecured, high-yielding debt issued by some recently collapsed property companies also suggests that some people have difficulty understanding the financial risks of investment products. The Australian Government, through the Financial Literacy Foundation, has a number of initiatives underway to improve financial education and literacy standards. ASIC has also been active in educating retail investors about financial products, and a range of private-sector initiatives are underway to help improve financial literacy standards. One way that the financial services industry can help retail investors make better investment decisions is by providing clear and concise information about their financial products. For some time now there have been concerns about the length and complexity of product disclosure statements and prospectuses. 2 BIS Review 148/2007 
ASIC has been trying to address some of these concerns through various initiatives. It has also recently introduced regulatory guidance to improve the quality of disclosure to retail investors in unlisted debentures. A related challenge facing the industry is financial advice, and how this is paid for. There appears to be a general reluctance on the part of retail investors to pay for financial advice on a fee-for-service basis. Instead, there has been a preference for commission-based advice, despite the conflicts of interest that can arise in this situation. This reluctance to pay for advice upfront appears to be a form of money illusion, whereby investors may feel that they are somehow paying less for financial advice if the cost is buried in reduced earnings in the future.  The regulatory environment in Australia has tried to deal with potential conflicts in commission–based advice by making it a requirement for advisors to provide their clients with a written statement of advice that sets out, among other things, the basis on which the advice is given, any potential conflicts of interest, and the dollar value of commissions they stand to receive. But the question remains as to whether full disclosure is enough to deal with the potential conflicts of interest associated with commission-based fees, or whether there is merit in the industry moving further in the direction of offering advice on a fee-for-service basis. The cost of providing investment services to retail investors is also a challenge that needs to be addressed. Recent research published by APRA compared the average net returns – that is, returns after all fees, expenses and taxes – for different types of superannuation funds. APRA found that over the decade to 2006, $1,000 invested in the average retail fund would have risen to $1,650 after fees, expenses and taxes, compared with $1,888 for an industry fund and about $2,100 for corporate and public sector funds. Of course, these figures are averages and there would have been significant variation in the returns of individual funds. While it is difficult to isolate the exact cause of the underperformance of retail funds, an important contributing factor would have been that fees and expenses on retail funds are typically higher than for industry and corporate funds. That said, I think it is encouraging that competition has been putting downward pressure on expense ratios across most categories of superannuation funds. Another issue which has received attention is what level of superannuation contributions is necessary to ensure an adequate retirement income. Determining the adequacy of contribution rates is difficult because the modelling relies on various assumptions about future investment returns, income growth, length of retirement etc. There is also a need to specify what is meant by “adequate”. Most of the recent research, however, suggests that, to ensure an adequate replacement income in retirement, the current level of superannuation guarantee contributions will need to be supplemented by the old-age pension for lower-income households, or by voluntary contributions for those households not eligible for the pension.  The issues I have raised today are, I am sure, well known to those of you in the industry. There are many considerations to be taken into account in resolving them, and there will no doubt need to be a large input from the industry in doing so. Conclusion For the moment, however, let me conclude by recording that the transformation of the superannuation industry over the past couple of decades has been one of the great success stories in the Australian financial sector. While further work needs to be done, conferences such as this play an important role in raising and resolving issues. BIS Review 148/2007 3 
I hope that your discussions over the next couple of days prove to be both thought–provoking and rewarding.  4 BIS Review 148/2007 
Glenn Stevens: Central bank communication  Address by Mr Glenn Stevens, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to the Sydney Institute, Sydney, 11 December 2007. *      *      * This evening I would like to talk about central bank communication. There are plenty of people who probably think that “central bank” and “communication” are not expressions that are normally thought of as belonging together. Yet communication has become steadily more open, and more important, in the central banking world over the years. At one time, overnight interest rates used to be adjusted without announcement or explanation – “snugging” was a popular term of the late 1980s. The market would generally take a few days, and the general public considerably longer, to work out what was happening when monetary policy was changing. They usually had to wait longer again for an explanation of why it was changing. That is no longer the case. These days, central banks say they are moving the interest rate, and say why, very openly. This particular form of transparency was adopted quite early at the RBA, back in 1990, under Bernie Fraser. Not only do they announce policy changes in a forthright fashion, most central banks set out their detailed assessment of economic conditions in published material. In a number of cases, they publish minutes of their policy discussions. Governors and others give speeches, appear before parliamentary committees and are frequently quoted by various commentators in the media. For central banks, historically quite discreet organisations, this is quite a change. I want to examine the reasons behind that change, and the case for openness. I want also to talk about the limits of openness. Finally, I will elaborate a little on our own recently announced changes in this area. Why communicate? To begin with, it is worth asking the question: why do central banks communicate? There are at least two reasons. The first arises from the principle of accountability in an open and democratic society. The central bank is charged with some important responsibilities – maintaining the purchasing power of the nation’s currency, pursuing “full employment” and fostering stable and reliable financial and payments systems, among others. It is endowed with substantial powers – in the RBA’s case, to buy and sell financial assets, commodities, real property, to lend money and to make certain regulations – in fact, to do anything that could be thought to come within the remit of “central banking business”. It stands to reason that the central bank should expect to account for the way in which it has used its powers to pursue its statutory goals. The framers of the Reserve Bank Act 1959 nearly 50 years ago very wisely placed the Parliament squarely in the centre of accountability arrangements. In recent times, the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 has required annual reporting of the relevant agencies, of which the Reserve Bank is one, but from the very beginning the RBA was required to issue an annual report to Parliament. Yet the requirements for more frequent communication have grown over the years. In part this reflects the increased development of capital markets and the speed and force with which they respond to economic developments. Markets crave information, and the central bank’s assessment of the state of the economy is one part of the information set. In part, the demand for communication accompanies increased operational independence for central banks. When the central bank is making an important policy decision under an authority delegated by the Parliament, as opposed to implementing a decision made by a minister – and that is what we are doing in the case of monetary policy – there will naturally BIS Review 147/2007 1 
be an expectation for accountability. It also reflects the general development of the community’s expectation to be more informed about important matters. That is a natural concomitant of a more affluent, educated and mature society. As such, it is something to be welcomed.  There is also the role of the media. Our political leaders are expected to answer questions from the media much more frequently, and across a much broader range of issues, than once was the case.1 Some of this spills over onto other institutions, including corporations and central banks. The media is responding to market demand for information here, but as in any other competitive industry, media organisations are also seeking to create new markets by supplying more intensive, more frequent coverage of more issues, including economic policy. The second rationale for more communication is the desire for more effective policy. Some policy actions have as much effect through conditioning expectations as by constraining current behaviour. This is very much true in the case of monetary policy. A change in the cash rate of modest size has only a pretty small impact on the economy. But expectations about a sequence of possible future interest rate changes can often be more powerful. What a central bank says, as much as what it does, affects those expectations. Even more important are expectations of future inflation. When people expect prices to rise rapidly, they bring forward purchases, put up their own prices, demand higher wages and so on. That helps to create the very inflation they expect. On the other hand, if people are convinced that inflation will be contained – perhaps because they believe that the central bank will do whatever is required to achieve that – they behave accordingly. In that case, their price setting, wage and purchasing behaviour helps keep inflation controlled. Expectations are more likely to be helpful in fostering economic stability when the public has a clear understanding of what the central bank’s goals are, how the central bank thinks the economy works and how in general terms it is likely to respond to various events, particularly pressure on inflation. That is why most central banks spend a good deal of time talking about their objectives and their policy framework. It is why they publish exhaustive analyses of economic conditions and offer such assessments as they can about likely future developments. Of course the world is highly uncertain, so central banks cannot spell out exactly what they would do in response to every conceivable scenario. There will always be the potential for some surprises. But if people understand the framework and the goals of policy, then their own response to that knowledge will usually be helpful in achieving the policy goal. Hence, communication is an important part of the policy process. How to communicate? And how much? So much for the rationale for communication. What are the channels central banks use? There are several. Most central banks have a program of publications. Australia’s central bank has been publishing the Bulletin every month since 1937.2 In most cases central banks publish the results of research of their staff. The views in these papers are those of the authors alone, but much of the research is part of the knowledge base available to the policy-makers and                                                  1  They are also expected to respond to more media questioning than their counterparts in other democracies, as far as I can see. 2  In Australia, it was a recommendation of the 1935–1937 Royal Commission that the Commonwealth Bank publish a regular statistical bulletin. The Reserve Bank took over this obligation after “separation” in 1960. 2 BIS Review 147/2007 
hence is usually of interest to those seeking an understanding of policy issues. The RBA has been publishing Research Discussion Papers since the late 1960s. Over the past 15 years or so, many central banks have upgraded their regular economic reporting, giving a more in depth account of economic conditions with a more analytical flavour. In some countries with formal inflation targets, these are called “inflation reports”, though they are about much more than inflation. These documents set out the factual background in a way which shows how policy makers account for economic and financial conditions in their decisions. In the process they usually reveal a good deal about how the central bank thinks the economy works – its “model”, if you will. In many, probably most, cases, these documents contain forward looking material. Forecasts for inflation (and often for other key macroeconomic variables), the assumptions on which the forecasts are based and the extent of uncertainty surrounding the forecasts are, to varying degrees, spelled out. A few central banks even publish a future interest rate path – albeit one heavily conditioned by assumptions which are almost certain not to be realised, for one reason or another. The RBA has progressively upgraded its own regular report. The Statement on Monetary Policy appears in the mid month of each quarter. This is a very comprehensive treatment of the local and global economies, financial markets and considerations for monetary policy. It contains the Bank’s inflation forecast, a sense of the risks surrounding the forecast, and a discussion of the forces conditioning the outlook for the economy. It also offers an account of the policy decisions the Board has made in the preceding period.  Central bankers give public speeches on issues of the day. In our case, we typically will take questions from the floor on such occasions as well. Sometimes the questions are even about the topic of the speech! The speeches, and the answers to questions, are routinely sifted by economists, the media and others for hints about the central bank’s intentions. That is not surprising, though sometimes readers are remarkably inventive in their efforts to read between the lines. I have certainly marvelled at some accounts of what I am supposed to have said. Nonetheless, these occasions do give the central bank the opportunity to talk about the issues it thinks are important, and to signal, if necessary, any changes to its view that might occur between the formal assessments of the economy appearing on the regular timetable. Central bankers make appearances in front of Parliamentary committees. As you may know, in our case, the Governor has been appearing twice yearly in front of the House of Representatives Economics Committee for about a decade now. Other officials of the Bank appear in front of various other committees as appropriate. These hearings give elected representatives the chance to ask questions at length. They are a key part of accountability and offer a useful opportunity for communication. They can also play, if used well, an educative role, developing a better understanding of policy issues than would be achievable in many other fora. Of course, there is always the risk that in such sessions the questioning can tend to aim more at political point scoring. Public communication is, however, a two edged sword. For every occasion when there is something important to say, there is another at which a central banker finds him or herself giving a speech, or releasing a formal document, which has little new to say on the economy, in an environment in which markets and observers already have a good understanding of the central bank’s assessment. On those occasions there is always the risk that further communication will inadvertently dislodge perfectly sensible expectations – which is one reason why speeches and documents are often, quite deliberately, a little on the unexciting side. Colour and movement are not necessarily useful in the central banker’s case. It is for this reason that the RBA was, for a long time, somewhat ambivalent about the practice adopted by some other central banks of making a statement of reasons for the policy decision even when the decision is to leave rates unchanged. While a decision to change rates has for many years been accompanied by a pretty detailed explanation in our BIS Review 147/2007 3 
case, a decision not to change rates often meant that we had little new information to impart. We adhered to the old adage “when you have nothing to say, keep your mouth shut”. These reservations were valid. But an increasing number of other central banks have managed to construct these statements and issue them regularly, without apparently doing much harm. More importantly, while there are plenty of occasions in which no change in interest rates is widely expected, and hence perhaps needs little explanation, there are others in which a no change decision does require careful explanation. Having reflected on this for some time this year, the Reserve Bank Board came to the judgement that the downside risks of such statements no longer outweigh the likely benefits. Accordingly, we have adopted the practice of issuing a short statement after every meeting, explaining the policy decision, whether or not the cash rate is to change. The first “no-change” statement was issued last week. Last week’s decision was a good example, in fact, of one where no change to the cash rate needed explanation. The statement noted the concern the Board had about the outlook for inflation, given the recent price data and the apparent strength in demand. It also noted that the outlook for the world economy looked a little weaker, and that trends in financial market pricing, over the preceding month, were likely to result in a rise in borrowing rates for Australians. In other words, financial conditions were shifting in the right direction for containing inflation, even without a further adjustment in the cash rate. Hence the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged, for the time being. In a further change to communication arrangements, commencing at the February 2008 meeting, our statement will be made on the day of the meeting, at 2.30 pm, rather than the next morning. Any change in the cash rate will still take effect the following day. This schedule will inform the markets during the Australian day, but will limit the time period between the decision being taken and it being publicly announced. The previous practice of delaying the announcement until 9.30 am the following day was originally adopted for logistical reasons, but they have long since disappeared. It is much better practice, and less risky, to announce the decision as promptly as possible once it has been made. Minutes and the limits to transparency That brings me to the one remaining area of central bank accountability and communication that I would like to talk about, which is the treatment of the minutes of policy making meetings. Practices vary in this area. The United States Federal Open Market Committee has been publishing minutes for many years. It was prompted initially by Congressional pressure for more openness, but before long moved beyond minimum requirements to a fairly full set of minutes including voting records of individual members. The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is required by statute to publish its minutes. The MPC’s culture is expressly, by intention of its creators, one of individual accountability. Hence the minutes include voting records of the members, and it is not uncommon for a significant proportion of members to differ from the majority – including two cases where the Governor was in the minority. MPC members hold a second meeting, subsequent to the policy meeting at which the interest rate decision is taken, for the purpose of approving the minutes, which are then released prior to the next policy meeting. The European Central Bank, in contrast, does not publish minutes. One of the key reasons is that the presidents/governors of national central banks sit on the Governing Council of the ECB but are required to make decisions for the euro area as a whole, as opposed to decisions that might suit the particular circumstances of their own countries. It is argued, not unreasonably, that publication of minutes and voting might prejudice the capacity of the national governors to take a euro area, rather than national, perspective. The ECB does 4 BIS Review 147/2007 
make additional efforts at communication of other kinds, including a regular press conference. Clearly there are views on both sides of this question, which reflect the different institutional arrangements across countries. This is why we have argued over time that, in the pursuit of the optimal degree of transparency, it would not make sense to “cherry pick” the high transparency aspects of every other system and assume that they should simply be grafted onto the Australian system. The nature of the Reserve Bank Board – a majority of whom are part-time members, drawn from various parts of the Australian community, but seeking to make decisions in the national interest as opposed to any industry, geographical or sectional interest – needs to be considered when thinking about disclosure practices. It is also important, I think, to articulate the point that there are reasonable limits to transparency in any system. It is not the case that releasing more material is always, by definition, going to lead to better informed public debate or better policy decisions. In contemplating the release of minutes of meetings in particular, and the form any such release might take, we need to balance a legitimate desire for information and accountability against the need to maintain a frank, open discussion at the meeting. At many meetings I have taken part in over the years, people have considered various arguments that ultimately were found to be unconvincing, but which did need to be examined in the interests of reaching a balanced decision. People also change their minds in the course of a meeting – and one would hope that that happens occasionally, since one of the key benefits of a having meeting is to learn from and respond to the views of the other participants. It is unlikely that these dynamics of a meeting could be sustained if every utterance were disclosed. The incentive could easily arise for people to be much more cautious in what they said, and to come to the meeting with a pre-written statement, rather than to engage in a genuinely interactive discussion. That would reduce the quality of the discussion and, ultimately, of the decision. And it is the quality of the decision, after all, which we should be seeking to maximise. What all of this means is that a decision to release minutes should not be taken lightly. Such documents have to be written carefully, taking into account the institutional structure, including the nature of the Board, and the need to preserve an environment of candid discussion. RBA minutes That said, there is no reason why, with careful drafting, a set of minutes that strikes the right balance cannot be compiled. Indeed, for a while now, we have been writing the minutes in just that way. After discussion among the Board members, we recently decided that there is no longer a strong case for not being prepared to release minutes of the monetary policy discussion. Accordingly, as announced last week, we will in future release the minutes of the monetary policy meetings with a lag of two weeks. The minutes from the November meeting were released last Wednesday. The minutes from the meeting held last week will be released on December 18. In addition, with the agreement of the Board, I am releasing at this time on the website the minutes from all meetings since I have been the chairman of the Board (that is, commencing with the October 2006 meeting). Those who are interested to read these documents – which will, outside the media and economic and financial professionals, be relatively few, I expect – will find the following features.  First, there is an account of the main factual material available to the Board and the issues arising from that material that came up during their discussion. There is nothing particularly startling there – the information available to the Bank is pretty much known by everyone else. The material does not cover every single indicator the Bank tracks – there are too many. So if your favourite statistic is not mentioned, that doesn’t mean we are ignoring it. Equally, BIS Review 147/2007 5 
those statistics that have been prominent in recent sets of minutes should not necessarily be seen as all-important for future decisions. The Board will always strive to form a comprehensive picture of the whole economy in assessing the economic outlook and the prospects for achieving the inflation objective, and in coming to its decision. Second, there is an account of the policy discussion that occurs towards the end of the meeting, which outlines the key considerations involved in the decision. Sometimes these considerations are quite straightforward. On other occasions, they may point in different directions in terms of their implications for interest rates, in which case the Board has to make an “on balance decision”. The minutes will set out as clearly as we can the logic behind the decision. Third, there is a record of what the decision was – that is, what target cash rate the Bank is to maintain in the period until the next meeting. Readers will note that comments are not attributed to individuals. The material is not a transcript – indeed we do not keep a transcript – and it is not an edited version of some other set of more detailed minutes. No other record of the monetary policy discussion exists. The minutes do not attempt to provide a “blow-by-blow” description of every comment made. But nor do the minutes released by other central banks, and it would not be sensible to do so, for the reasons I articulated a few moments ago. Readers will also observe that the pattern of votes of individuals is not recorded, only the outcome. That is a point of difference with other central banks which publish minutes. But in those cases the decision-makers are full-time appointees, in some cases in systems with expressly individual, as opposed to collective, responsibility for their decisions. That is not the system Australia operates, and our pattern of disclosure reflects the institutional arrangements. In the interests of clarity, let me also state that these minutes do not cover issues other than monetary policy. Other matters that the Board considers from time to time – such as the Bank’s accounts, audit processes, issues concerning subsidiaries and other governance questions – are not recorded in these published minutes, because there is no public policy case to do so. There is proper disclosure on these matters, but through the appropriate vehicle, which is mainly the annual report. This is in line with practice in other central banks, and with common sense. Our view is that minutes of the type we are now releasing, in combination with the regular statement after each meeting, and the large volume of other material released by the Bank, meets the legitimate claim of observers to know the basis of the Board’s policy decisions. It is consistent with arrangements that prevail in the countries to which we would look for examples of good practice. At the same time, this approach should preserve the candour of discussion at the meeting and recognises and respects the basis on which the non executive members of the Board serve. As such, it strikes the right balance. Conclusion Communication has become a more important part of the central banker’s tool kit. While we will rarely be found courting publicity, neither will we shirk the responsibility to explain what we are doing and why. That is a requirement of good governance, but also it will usually make policy decisions more effective. There are limits to transparency. More is not always better, and because the decision to disclose additional information is hard to reverse once made, it should be made with care. Nonetheless, after reflecting on our own experience and evaluating experience around the world, we recently judged that the time had come to move Australia’s arrangements to conform with normal practice elsewhere. I was very pleased to learn when I met the new Treasurer a couple of weeks ago that he supported the changes. 6 BIS Review 147/2007 
This material will not compete too well with the best seller lists, and almost everyone will (I hope) have better things to read while on the beach over the summer than the Reserve Bank Board’s minutes. But for the professionals, this will hopefully make a modest further contribution to their understanding of the Board’s decisions. And for any of the rest of you who are having trouble getting to sleep … Whatever your preferred reading material, I wish you a pleasant festive season and a happy and prosperous New Year.

Radovan Jelašić: Social responsibility in Serbia and the UN “Global Compact” Initiative Speech by Mr Radovan Jelašić, Governor of the National Bank of Serbia, at the launch of the United Nations Global Compact Initiative (UNGC) in Serbia, Belgrade, 6 December 2007. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen, When did you last visit a hospital that cares for children with mental health disorders? Where did you throw the glass bottle after you drank your juice yesterday? Is the building you live in accessible to physically handicapped people? Have you ever been to the area where Roma people live under the Gazela Bridge? And, at risk of sounding sarcastic, have you convinced yourself again today that all problems in this country should be dealt with by the government and that you have the right to criticize that same government to your heart’s desire? Do you think that you as an ordinary citizen have some kind of responsibility for all those events taking place outside your micro cosmos? When was the last time you walked down Knez Mihajlova street looking up to read the names of legacy donors and asked yourself how we compare to them? Have you shaken hands, opened the door, smiled or simply been nice to anybody today? What will our country look like in five or ten years time depends only on us and nobody else. If anyone should make our country more beautiful, it should be us, you and me, and we do not and can not have any excuse not to do something. You and I are those who not only have the opportunity but an obligation as well. We have the good will, and as company managers, some money on our hands too. So “let Serbia rise” as Dositej said, but not against somebody or something, but for a more beautiful, smiling and, above all else, happier Serbia. If you are an enterprise that feels the need to do something more than just pay taxes regularly, which is of course necessary but not enough, then you are in the right place today! We have gathered here today to meet and to get to know one another, to unite people and companies who care, who know how and are willing to do more to better not only their own lives, but also the lives of all the people in our country. As a start, a big step forward will have been made if we who have gathered here today were to unite as people of good will who feel the need to do something more, something better, and something nobler for our country. And our country will not, can not and should not be changed by either the IMF, the World Bank or the European Union, but by us – you and me, and Mr. Vice-President and the ministers – today in their official capacity, and tomorrow as ordinary citizens. The aim of today’s launch and cooperation of the UN and the NBS is getting the information through to companies operating in Serbia about the Global Compact initiative, the largest global voluntary association dedicated to promoting socially responsible operations. The main reason for our participation in this project is not to support the launching of this initiative, but to learn something new and do something concrete together with the people who care about the future of our country and our planet. Cooperation of the public sector, non-government organizations, and companies is not only possible but also indispensable, and I am convinced that much more can be done to the benefit of all the participants. Our research has shown that in Serbia today there is awareness of socially responsible operations, but more on conceptual level than in terms of concrete projects. What is lacking is the ignition spark, and I sincerely hope that today’s meeting will provide just that! There is a proverbial saying in our country that “Anything that can be bought for money is cheap.” So, in that spirit, it is not only the privatization receipts that matter in the context of foreign direct investments, but also the companies’ attitude to social responsibility issues BIS Review 147/2007 1 
which contributes to changing our country for the better. There are many companies in Serbia that have not yet had any experience with projects promoting socially responsible behavior, but what matters is their good will to join in. Many companies and institutions, including the NBS, are already engaged in many activities that can be defined as socially responsible: waste recycling on the site, free of charge training of the NBS ex-employees, financial support to handicapped children, etc. However, as members of the Global Compact we shall have the opportunity to share our experiences, to formulate our common platform and to become a part of a bigger family. And finally, let me be explicit: this is a voluntary gathering of people and companies – you have the opportunity but no obligation to join this initiative. You have no obligation but you have an opportunity to give, and give only as much as you think you ought to. You are not pressured in any way; there is no obligation on your part other than strictly moral, which I rank higher than any money-related obligation! But it feels good to be part of this initiative, as it creates positive energy and enables cooperation with people of good will who feel the need to do something more for Serbia. I wish you all welcome once again. 2 BIS Review 147/2007 
Jean-Claude Trichet: The US economy, the euro area economy, and their central banks Speech delivered by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, at the award ceremony on the occasion of the “6. Karl Klasen Journalistenpreis”, Hamburg, 7 December 2007. *      *      * Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren, ich freue mich, heute Abend gemeinsam mit Ihnen diese festliche Atmosphäre genießen zu dürfen, und es ist mir eine Ehre, der Hauptredner der Verleihung dieses Journalistenpreises zu sein. Ich danke Ihnen, Herrn Kai-Jacob Klasen, herzlich für die Einladung und finde es bewegend, heute Abend im Rahmen dieser Veranstaltung Dr. Karl Klasen zu gedenken. Die Stiftung, die diese Preisverleihung ausrichtet, hat sich das lobenswerte Ziel gesetzt, Journalisten zu Arbeiten über die deutsch-amerikanischen Beziehungen zu inspirieren, und zeichnet diejenigen aus, die sich durch ihre Beiträge um die Festigung der Bindungen zwischen Deutschland und den USA verdient gemacht haben. Was die Geldpolitik anbelangt, so stehen die transatlantischen Beziehungen nun im breiteren Kontext der Interaktionen zwischen dem Eurosystem und dem Federal Reserve System. In meiner Funktion als Präsident der Europäischen Zentralbank habe ich mich stets darum bemüht, die engen und freundschaftlichen Verbindungen zu unseren US amerikanischen Kollegen zu pflegen und zu stärken. [Ladies and Gentlemen,  It is a pleasure for me to be here today in this festive atmosphere, and an honour to be the main speaker at this journalist award ceremony. I am very grateful, Mr Kai-Jacob Klasen, for your invitation, and I am moved to pay tribute tonight to the memory of Dr Karl Klasen.  The foundation hosting this ceremony has the commendable purpose of inspiring and rewarding journalists’ works that strengthen German-American relationships. In the area of monetary policy, transatlantic relations are now written in the broader context of the interactions between the Eurosystem and the Federal Reserve System, and it has always been my aim, as President of the European Central Bank, to preserve and foster close and friendly relationships with our American counterpart.] The goal of my talk today is to show that it is worth pursuing and extending this relationship. The euro area and the United States share some common external and internal experiences that justify the increasing cooperation that exists both at the policy and institutional levels. To convince you of this, I will first show that the United States and the euro area face a similar external environment and that their economic and financial connections have been reinforced in the context of globalisation. I will then argue that the monetary authorities of the United States and the euro area face common features due to a certain degree of internal diversity within such large economic areas. This is why sharing our thoughts and experiences always proves invaluable in our duty to ensure efficient monetary policy. In the last section of my talk, I will demonstrate how this interaction is facilitated by institutional cooperation and the development of personal contacts with our American colleagues.  Trade and financial integration: a shared external environment The euro area and the United States are the largest economies in the world, hosting more than 600 million inhabitants and responsible for around 40% of world production. The preponderance of these two regions and their similar size naturally calls for parallels to be made. Viewed from outside, these two regions are large economic blocs that have led BIS Review 146/2007 1 
globalisation and the surge in world trade, financial flows and innovative ideas that has been getting stronger during the last few decades.  Trade openness The euro area is the largest exporter in the world. Its extra-area exports amounted to €1.9 trillion last year, while US exports reached €1.1 trillion. Together, these two economies account for almost a third of world trade.  The euro area is a significantly open economy for its size. Its exports and imports of goods reached 33% of its own GDP in 2006, a figure to add to the rising importance of trade in services – around 10% of GDP. In 1998, euro area exports and imports only accounted for 24% of GDP, and trade in services for 8%. Trade openness of the euro area has therefore been reinforced since the advent of the euro. The United States is slightly less open, with trade in goods representing 22% of GDP and trade in services 6% of GDP. However, among euro area trade partners, the United States plays a central role. Indeed, around 15% of euro exports in goods goes to the United States. Looking at the other side of the Atlantic, American exports represent around 10% of our imports of goods. On balance, over the last few years, we have recorded a large trade surplus with the United States. Our goods exports exceeded our imports from the United States by more than USD 80 billion. In the services sector, where trade has been growing and continues to grow, our connection with the United States is even more important. 22% of our services exports goes to the United States and a quarter of our imports come from the United States. In particular, the export performance of our travel and transportation services is always outstanding. Nevertheless, most euro area trade occurs with our European neighbours, and with Japan and China. This could suggest that the linkages between the United States and the euro area are of a secondary importance. However, this would underestimate the significance of the US economy because there are also indirect transmission channels. Indeed, the United States plays a broader role in the world economy, and there can be second-round effects that are not captured by the crude figures I have just presented.  These second-round effects include trade linkages, but also financial and confidence linkages. After the financial turmoil experienced this summer, it is becoming increasingly important to understand them. The importance of financial openness The United States, where the recent financial troubles originated, and the euro area are very open to financial flows. US external assets and liabilities exceeded USD 13 trillion in 2005, and the figure for the euro area is very similar. In percentage of GDP, US external assets represented 90 % of US GDP and US external liabilities amounted to 110 % of GDP in 2005. As regards the euro area in 2005 as well, external assets represented 124 % of euro area GDP and external liabilities reached 137 % of euro area GDP ; therefore, in relative terms, the euro area is financially more open that the United States.  European investors are also central players in American markets. As an example, the euro area stock of direct investment in the United States reached more than €600 billion at the end of 2006. Some industries are particularly present in the United States: the trade and the financial sector, of course, but also the chemical industries of France, Germany and the Netherlands have large investments at stake in the United States. The situation is fairly similar in the other direction, with around €630 billion from US firms being invested in the euro area, principally in the services industries of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. The current levels of FDI flows show that these bilateral links will continue to strengthen in the future. Portfolio investments from the euro area to the United States are also of an impressive magnitude. The stock of US portfolio assets held by the euro area reached 2 BIS Review 146/2007 
almost €1.5 trillion last year, this being about a third of European holdings worldwide. The euro and the US dollar are also the currencies of denomination of the majority of portfolio assets traded. More than three-quarters of portfolio assets worldwide are denominated in euro and in dollars, according to the available data.1All in all, the United States and the euro area are large trade and financial partners. Arguably, the United States seems to have a greater impact on world business cycles, probably mainly because of the growing importance of financial channels in the transmission of macroeconomic shocks.  For both the United States and the euro area, trade and financial channels have, of course, direct consequences for monetary policy. For instance, the increase in imports from low-cost countries has ensured that import price inflation has remained contained. Import prices declined in the period 2001-2003 in the euro area and remained stable throughout the following years. However, commodity prices experienced higher levels of inflation as a result of the strong growth of emerging economies such as India and China. Globalisation can therefore have mixed effects on inflation. Finally, it has also been argued that both the United States and the euro area witnessed a loosening of the link between inflation and activity because of increased openness. This has important implications for monetary policy. Diversity within large economic blocs – a common challenge for monetary policy Although we have seen that the environment outside the euro area and the United States has gained importance, the internal economic situation remains a major focus of attention within central banks. Almost nine years after the euro changeover, euro area macroeconomic developments continue to mask some diversity across the euro area countries. Nonetheless, this diversity in terms of inflation and output growth is currently of approximately the same scale as in the United States.  More specifically, euro area inflation differentials have exhibited a strong decline in recent decades. Starting from an unweighted standard deviation of around 6 percentage points at the beginning of the 1990s, inflation dispersion has fallen to around only half a percentage point so far in 2007. More specifically, this year there has been an overall decline in inflation rates among traditional high-inflation countries compared with last year. However, since August, inflation rates in all countries have risen, probably as a result of higher oil and food prices. This implies that dispersion in the euro area is currently somewhat below inflation dispersion among the 14 US Metropolitan Statistical Areas, where it has fluctuated around 1 percentage point over the last two decades.  The dispersion in real GDP growth rates, measured in terms of the unweighted standard deviation, has been moving around a level of 2 percentage points over the past few decades, with no apparent upward or downward trend. This is similar to the dispersion witnessed in output growth across regions within the United States. The persistence of macroeconomic developments in the euro area A key feature of the observed economic diversity is the persistence of macroeconomic developments across euro area countries. For example, the difference in the cumulated growth of real GDP between the two euro area countries with the largest and the smallest output increases, respectively, was more than 50 percentage points in the period 1998-2006. The situation was similar across US states. Furthermore, the equivalent accumulated spread between the two euro area countries with the lowest and highest inflation rates was almost 20 percentage points and in unit labour costs for the total economy between 20 and 25                                                  1  CPIS data, IMF, 2005. BIS Review 146/2007 3 
percentage points over the same period. In the United States, the spread in CPI inflation between the two Metropolitan Areas with the lowest and highest inflation rates was slightly lower, at around 18% for the same period. In the euro area, in addition to the decline in dispersion of inflation, activity and labour cost developments, another key feature is that business cycles are converging and output gap fluctuations are becoming more similar across countries. This feature is not apparent in the United States, where the dispersion of cycles and of trend GDP growth, seem to explain roughly equal parts of growth dispersion between states. For instance, last year, the acceleration in activity and the rebound in the euro area’s real GDP growth was a widely shared phenomenon across the various euro area member countries. Hence, registered growth dispersion across the euro area countries seems to be mainly explained by differences in trend output growth, rather than cyclical developments, a feature I would like to reflect more on. Differences in trend output growth in the euro area The differences in trend output growth in the euro area might reveal structural factors that are a normal feature in a monetary union. Differences in trend output growth may, for instance, reflect diverse initial conditions and catching-up processes in some countries. For example, in recent years, per capita income in Ireland has risen from a level well below that of the euro area in the early 1990s to a level well above. In the early 1990s the GDP per capita of Ireland represented 75 % of the average of what were to become the first 12 euro area countries. Last year, the level in Ireland was about 30% above the euro area level. Moreover, a country may experience an equilibrating adjustment process following a shock. Diversity stemming from these factors is also economically justified, needed and observed within other currency areas. In an environment of high adjustment capacity, such divergences can be interpreted as a desirable equilibrating mechanism, contributing to sustainable convergence among euro area countries. However, in some cases, persistent macroeconomic differentials may reflect inappropriate national policies, structural inefficiencies and rigidities or a malfunctioning adjustment mechanism in individual euro area countries. Differentials resulting from such factors may be detrimental to the dynamics of economic activity and employment. These are sources of macroeconomic differentials that policy-makers should be concerned about and where measures should be taken at the national level in order to increase economic flexibility. The importance of the functioning of product, labour and financial markets Starting with monetary policy, the single monetary policy with a uniform policy interest rate for the euro area countries cannot, as you know, directly influence diversity in output growth or inflation across the euro area countries. This emphasises the importance of only those countries that have reached sustainable convergence – as prescribed in the Maastricht criteria – participating in the euro area.  Well-designed structural policies – undertaken at the national level – should be implemented to enhance flexibility in product and labour markets and thereby increase the adjustment capacity of economies. Such reforms should aim to enhance productivity growth and labour utilisation while maintaining stable macroeconomnic conditions. In this context, the Lisbon strategy is a fundamental and ambitious programme to draw our attention to the urgency of such structural reforms. The United States, where cross-state labour is higher, could also be considered to be a role model for Europe. Speaking to an audience of journalists and business executives, I am well aware of the hard task you are confronted with – that of conveying the message about the beneficial effects of reforms in growth and job creation. In this context, it is essential to understand and 4 BIS Review 146/2007 
communicate that the medium to long-term benefits of structural reforms will significantly reward the initial investment. I can only encourage all responsible parties in these communication efforts. More specifically, on the labour market, economic flexibility can be promoted by removing the institutional barriers to flexible wage and price-setting mechanisms. Let me stress that social partners share responsibility for ensuring that wage determination appropriately takes into account productivity and labour market conditions at the industrial, sectoral and regional level and does not jeopardise competitiveness or employment. And one should also take into account the fact that wage setting in the public sector often serves as a role model for the private sector. In addition, early retirement policies have a significant negative impact on labour supply and, hence, on the participation and employment rate. In the context of wage setting, sufficient wage differentiation is needed to improve employment opportunities for less-skilled workers and in regions or sectors with high unemployment.  Reforms are also needed in product markets. Let me stress the importance of fully completing the Single Market, particularly in services and network industries. A deeper integration of markets would stimulate price flexibility by fostering competition and open product markets. This requires that existing barriers to labour and capital mobility within the euro area be removed. Greater cross-border competition and the integration of markets across the euro area countries would contribute to lower prices, an area in which Europe may again find an interesting benchmark in the United States. These reforms could also enhance adjustment processes in individual countries in the event of asymmetric shocks or differing cyclical developments.  National authorities can make a substantial contribution, not only by implementing sound structural policies, but also by ensuring a proper functioning of adjustment mechanisms within the euro area and by implementing well-designed fiscal policies. Here, I would like to repeat that the best contribution fiscal policy can make to the proper functioning of the euro area is to be sustainable and medium-term oriented, fully in line with the orientations provided by the Stability and Growth Pact. Moreover, fiscal policy can and should also focus on increasing effectiveness and efficiency of the public sector itself through “high quality” expenditure and tax policies. Large and inefficient public sectors can put the brakes on economic activity by imposing a high tax burden on the economy and channelling resources into unproductive uses. There, speaking in Germany, I have to mention that Germany itself has been exemplary in containing overall public spending as a proportion of GDP over the last years despite many challenges and a difficult environment. In 2007 the Commission estimates that public spendings will represent 43.8 % of GDP, which is 4.3 percentage points less than in 1999. Cooperation between the two major monetary authorities I hope I have by now convinced you that the monetary authorities in the United States and the euro area face challenges that are similar. Internally, diversity in these large areas is of the same magnitude, although possibly not of the same nature. Externally, both regions count on a large external sector, with significant bilateral linkages. Similar experiences naturally call for close working relations. This interaction has become particularly intense since the advent of the euro and the setting up of the European Central Bank and of the Eurosystem, but at the same time builds on a long-standing history of central bank multilateral cooperation in various international institutions and fora, including the Bank for International Settlements since the 1930s, the International Monetary Fund since the mid-1940s, the G10 since the 1960s, the G7 since the mid-1970s and, more recently, the Financial Stability Forum and the Group of Twenty.

Contacts with the Federal Reserve These international organisations provide an excellent opportunity for the Federal Reserve Chairman and myself, for the members of the Boards as well as for the staff of both the Fed and the ECB/Eurosystem, to meet very regularly. To give you some idea of the level of contact we have, I can say that Ben and I meet, through the G7, the G10, the G20, the IMF and BIS meetings, probably a little more than once a month on average. In addition, Mr Bernanke and I jointly participate in a number of international conferences. Indeed, through our regular meetings, Ben and I have built up a very close working relationship, a climate of mutual trust, and a platform for direct and quick contact in special circumstances that would require urgent communication.  Why is this important? The purpose of our contact is not the coordination of our monetary policies. This would be incompatible with the orientation of our policies towards our respective domestic objectives. Rather, the benefit of our close contact lies in the in-depth exchange of information and views on recent economic developments, on the monetary, financial and economic outlook in our respective economies, and on the policy challenges ahead. This includes, as I discussed before, trade and financial linkages between our two economies, directly or via other economies. Sharing first-hand knowledge on the world outlook and on how we see our respective domestic economies influencing and being influenced by the global outlook is extremely important in today’s globalised economy. On very rare occasions in the past, our close working relationship has also permitted to work out swift action. A prime example of this is the decision the ECB took in the very afternoon of the day of the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001.  A second example is the decisions we took to help stabilising money market conditions during the financial market turmoil of last summer. Here again, close contact with the Fed proved extremely useful in sharing information on the financial conditions and central bank actions in our respective economies. The close contact I have with the Chairman is, as you see, only the tip of the “iceberg”. Our two institutions collaborate closely at all possible levels, involving Board members, management and staff. Across various domains of central banking, we have set up joint platforms for the regular exchange of information. In the field of economic research, we have set up the International Research Forum on Monetary Policy to discuss theoretical and empirical aspects of monetary policy. So far, four conferences have been organised, and a fifth one is scheduled for June 2008. In the area of payment and settlement systems and infrastructure, we have organised a number of joint conferences, for instance in April 2006 on central counterparty clearing, as well as regular meetings with the Federal Reserve Board. Even in an area such as education, we have undertaken joint work, for example at the conference on the Role of Central Banks in Economic and Personal Finance Education in Poland in 2006, organised by Narodowy Bank Polski, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the ECB. Our ties are also facilitated by geographic proximity. You may be surprised to hear me mention geographic proximity, given that the centres of the Eurosystem and Federal Reserve System are in Frankfurt and Washington respectively. However, the ECB maintains a permanent representative office at the IMF, only a few streets away from the Federal Reserve Board in Washington. Though liaison with the Federal Reserve is not its main raison d'être, this office is another channel for closer contact and interaction. Staff members of the two central banks also participate regularly in conferences organised by the other institution. For instance, so far in 2007, over ten staff members of the ECB, the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve District Banks have presented their research work in seminars and conferences organised by one of these institutions. Staff members also regularly visit the other central bank, spending several days discussing research work or technical issues. On some occasions, these stays even run over several 6 BIS Review 146/2007 
months. Since 2003, six ECB staff members have spent a total of 40 months at the Federal Reserve Board and District Banks as part of the ECB’s External Work Experience programme. And I do not mention here the many many relationships that are established between the national central banks of the Eurosystem and the Federal Reserve System.  Conclusion  Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to conclude. The euro area and the United States are large economic blocs which are, at the same time, largely open to world markets. The last decades, in particular, have witnessed a tightening of the trade and financial linkages and the bilateral relationships between the United States and the euro area have been reinforced. As a result, central banks worldwide, and in particular the Federal Reserve and the Eurosystem, always keep an eye on partners’ economic, monetary and financial developments. The ECB and the Federal Reserve System have many opportunities to share their experience and technical expertise, whether through discussions within international meetings or in informal ways through conferences, staff visits, personal contacts of all nature, including confident personal relationships at the level of Chairmen. I would also like to point to one example of cooperation that might look unusual. Last year, we had one case of cooperation in the domain of culture and arts, as the Federal Reserve exhibited a remarkable set of the art works of its collection at the premises of the ECB in Frankfurt. This art exhibition was another symbolic illustration of our close cross-Atlantic ties, in which tonight’s journalist prize ceremony also plays a part. I have always been convinced that a very strong relationship between both sides of the Atlantic is essential for the stability and continued prosperity of our respective continents but also for the continuing stability and prosperity of the global economy itself. This is today particularly true in a period of immense opportunities and of significant challenges. Thank you very much for your attention. References Bayoumi T. and A.

Ardian Fullani: Monetary policy strategies for small economies Speech by Mr Ardian Fullani, Governor of the Bank of Albania, at the VII Annual Conference of the Bank of Albania “Monetary Policy Strategies for Small Economies”, Tirana, 6 December 2007. *      *      * Dear ladies and gentlemen, It is a great pleasure to open the proceedings of the 7th Conference of the Bank of Albania. On behalf of the institution and myself I take this opportunity to welcome all participants. I am confident that the following two days will instigate debate and discussion on key central bank issues.  This year’s main topic will focus on the classical function of a central bank: “monetary policy”. Institutional framework, decision making process, monetary transmission efficiency and other issues related with financial markets, macroeconomic and financial stability, will make interesting topics of discussions from our esteemed speakers.  I am confident that our panellists are well-known senior experts; therefore, on behalf of the institution I would like to thank them heartily for accepting to share with us their views and findings.  Given that the proceedings of the Conference will extensively cover theoretical models and countries experiences as well I would like to briefly present the evolution of our central bank during the last three years.  To our pleasure the enhancement of analytical and modelling capacities of the Albanian institutions has been widely recognized yielding a greater ownership in our medium run economic and financial development programs.  Since the beginning of transition most of these programs have been designed and implemented under the setup of IMF conditional support programs. Even the current policy setup is designed under such program. We currently believe this is the final one which gets IMF financial support, implying that our economy is matured and that Albania is on the right track. After many hardships of transition, the Albanian authorities should have full ownership in the medium-term development programs of our country. This is the reason why the Bank of Albania has quite for long been engaged in a comprehensive process of scrutinizing and choosing the best options. The year which is coming to an end marked another important chapter in this context. In contrast to the previous two years, the Bank of Albania has further deepened its cautious research of all aspects characterizing the present and future of monetary policy.  It has been quite for a long time that the central bank has publicly announced its efforts in assessing objectively and professionally the future of the Bank of Albania monetary policy. These were not sporadic efforts but part of a process which initiated three years ago with the only objective of finding the answers to the following questions: Should we move to another monetary policy regime? What regime would be the most appropriate one?  I believe you share the same opinion with me that finding the answers to the aforementioned questions is not an easy thing. This is not a plain mechanical action. In the last three years the Bank of Albania has been involved in an intensive process of assessment, analysis and conclusions for the future of monetary policy. And we have not been alone throughout this process.  BIS Review 146/2007 1 
Together with other Albanian institutions – first and foremost with fiscal authorities, different European and regional central banks, other international financial institutions and academia, we have tried to identify the most suitable monetary policy regime to be adopted.  During the last three years, we have been tossing ideas and scrupulously studying the details of a fully fledged inflation targeting regime. Based on the current features and expected developments of the financial markets, we believe the inflation targeting regime provides the best policy choice for the future.  A relatively long history of low inflation, constant soundness of the macroeconomic situation, stable and sound banking system, free floating exchange rate, a suitable institutional framework, fiscal consolidation are important factors that have convinced us on the potential success of inflation targeting regime. However, we are aware that there is still a lot to be done in this context, in particular as far as monetary transmission mechanism and financial market efficiency are concerned.  Furthermore, under a relatively rapid and considerable development of the Albanian economy we are sure that the advantages a complete and independent monetary policy framework provides are larger in size than the disadvantages. Therefore, the currency board has not been considered a possible option for the future.  On the other hand, the current operational targets (quantitative limits on net assets of the Bank of Albania and the banking system), or the so-called performance criteria, which are part of today’s decision-making, might not be able to preserve their binding power after the expiration of the conditional agreement with the IMF in 2008. These intermediate objectives may be replaced by a concrete and transparent objective such as the inflation rate, which provides a more direct communication of monetary policy decisions in economy in order to achieve the main target of the Bank of Albania. Consequently, summarizing what has been previously said we have identified the inflation targeting regime as our best choice versus currency board and monetary targeting. Another argument which supports our choice is that various internationally recognized experts have compared the current setup of monetary policy to an implicit inflation targeting framework.  Furthermore, we believe this regime will provide a better platform for harmonizing the monetary policy with the fiscal one, implying that the fiscal authority will seriously commit to support the proposed setup.  To this purpose, we invite the Albanian Government to reach a consensus on the key objectives of both policies, monetary and fiscal, adopting the convergence criteria as a strategic goal.  Success in this endeavour requires Albania, among other things, not only continuity on the path of sound macro policies but even strengthening them further. This means a monetary policy focused on maintaining price stability and a prudent fiscal policy which will ensure that Albania’s deficits and debt ratios are sustainable and at low levels to increase the attractiveness to international investors. Put differently pursuing a monetary policy focused on price stability and a prudent fiscal policy, will no doubt reduces Albania’s risk premium. The benefit of this achievement will be felt throughout the economy. To support my idea I have to tell you one fresh news. Yesterday Albania succeeded to sell internationally a seven year fixed rate bond in Lek. This was not a result of a toss of coin, but a reflection of international confidence in the Albanian economy and its macro policies. This confidence should increase in 2008, 2009 and beyond. Regardless of the monetary policy regime it is to be said that the chances for this setup to be successful are greater under a developed financial market, which understands properly the monetary policy signals and transmits them adequately to the economy. Monetary policy efficiency implies the financial market efficiency.  2 BIS Review 146/2007 
This issue has been part of my earlier discussions; however I would like to highlight that only recently we have taken concrete steps which will improve certain financial market segments.  We have currently tried to adopt a set of measures which will facilitate the reformation process of the financial market by further deepening it. In more concrete terms, the Government securities market and the interbank market have been most particularly under our special focus.  After several consultations with all actors in place we decided to come up with a package of initiatives and priorities during 2008 whose purpose is to establish incentives and minimize risks in the Albanian financial market: - Broadening and deepening the base of participants in the Government securities market Starting from January 2008 we will increase the investors’ base, eligible to directly invest in the auctions of Government bonds. We believe it will increase the competition while so-far this was a privilege enjoyed by the banking system.  - Reducing the interbank market risk  So far, the banking system has applied limits on the amounts it can lend in the interbank market. Therefore, we are working on introducing a new law on repurchase agreements, which will enable the risk-free conduct of repurchase agreements among commercial banks.  - Establishing the delivery versus payment system In order to minimize the payment settlement risk and facilitate the intermediation in all types of transactions involving collateralized loans, repurchase agreements and outright purchase and sale of Government papers, we are working to put into practice the principle of delivery versus payment system.  - Enhancing the interbank market efficiency  In collaboration with the Ministry of Finance we have agreed on less frequent Government treasury bills auctions. Moreover the size to be issued in each auction schedule will increase. This less frequent auction schedule will increase the number of transactions in the interbank market for the period in-between the two auctions as banks will try to reduce the costs of liquidity. On the other hand it will limit the opportunity of banks to be liquid based on distributing their treasury bills investment and consequently, they will seek other market options such as the interbank market.  - Introducing the prime rate Being convinced that the monetary policy may be efficient through transparency the Bank of Albania aims to introduce in the first half of 2008 the “prime rate” to the set of orientation rates used by commercial banks.  Regardless of the measures to be adopted I would like to say that other financial market segments need to come along with us in this challenge. I have to say that the financial intermediation role of other financial institutions is weak and it has no substantial influence on the intermediation and reallocation of financial funds in economy. I think today’s reality provides a lot of room for making the capital market reactive. According to our estimates, the number of major companies certified by well-known international auditors is ever-increasingly becoming larger.  Further to my speech I would like to focus on another priority of the Bank of Albania, that of financial stability. It holds true that macroeconomic stability is crucial and precedes all other important economic and financial developments. Without macroeconomic stability there is neither growth, nor foreign investment or reallocation; consequently there is no development.  However, macroeconomic stability without financial stability would be a utopia; it would be like a non-standing bridge. This is the reason why we have been paying special attention to BIS Review 146/2007 3 
financial stability throughout 2007. The recent developments in the sub-prime mortgage loans must serve as an excellent reminder of the never ending surprises which from time to time cause a lot of turmoil for the financial market stability. Moreover this episode once more highlights the necessity for more harmony between monetary policy and financial stability. I want to make clear that by financial stability I do not assume only the absence of a financial crisis. First and foremost it implies a functional and efficient financial system in its intermediation role.  I personally believe that too tight regulations truly minimize all the risks, but on the other hand they might not always be conducive to sustained growth.  Therefore, the real challenge we are facing is to find an optimal balance between deregulation, which promotes market forces and financial innovations, and negative consequences of possible market failures and financial crises.  Obviously, this optimal balance is hard to be actualized in the daily practice. Therefore more empirical studies need to be made, which I believe is one of the main priorities of the newly established Financial Stability Department.  However, I would like to underline that as a supervisory authority we have been very prudent during the present year, considering among others the rapid growth of credit portfolio in the last 2-3 years. I take this opportunity to inform the banking system and the public at large that starting from January 2008 the Credit Registry will begin to operate.  Special attention has been paid to strengthening banking supervision, in particular to that part which relates to the governance of commercial banks. Moreover, we have required more transparency from the banking system and a more accountable relationship with the public. The continuous improvement of human capacities involved in internal control and risk management has for a long time been a concern for the Bank of Albania. With reference to the latter I would like to underscore that we have already identified three greatest risks whose presence would have severe consequences on the financial stability. I have to say that this group of risks characterizes the whole region; consequently there is a lot of room for cooperation in this context.  1  Credit risk  Credit risk directly relates to the boom of credit to economy in the last years. Although the statistics indicate that the share of non-performing loans is low, prudence is required. We all do know that the rating and re-rating methods may be a tool in the hands of banks to keep the reality away from the truth. The entrance of big international foreign groups puts upward pressure on the other banking operators attempt to compete for borrowers which may often deteriorate the credit portfolio quality. Moreover, let us not forget that the companies’ balance sheets lack transparency which makes another issue for this matter. To conclude I would like to say that the current developments in the real estates market may potentially have a negative impact. A considerable rise in prices when real estates account for about 80 per cent of the collateral may have a negative impact in case there is a sudden fall of prices in the fixed assets market.  2 Exchange rate risk As of November 2007 outstanding credit is shared by 70 per cent of foreign currency credit and 30 per cent in the local currency. It is my impression that the figures are similar to the whole region. Extending credit in foreign currency to borrowers with income in national currency means that a sudden exchange rate depreciation could threaten their capacity to repay.  4 BIS Review 146/2007 
3 Contagion risk resulting from the presence of big banking groups throughout the region Currently we are all witnesses of a large-scale penetration of some big international banking groups throughout our region. This development has obviously been welcome as it has provided a better and more efficient allocation of free assets in economy. However, I believe that more prudence is required in this context. A disturbing issue for the parent bank or a concern of one of its branches in the region may cause turbulences for the fact that these banking groups have large market shares. Moreover, host-host supervision-related concerns have not been covered by the Basle standards which makes the whole situation even more complex.  In conclusion, I would like to highlight that our work has been guided by a simple but progressive philosophy which has aimed at: - Establishing sound and operating structures; - Concluding and improving the legal and regulatory base; and - Absorbing qualified and professional human capacities to cope with the future challenges.  I express my belief that the Bank of Albania is fully capable to have the full ownership of designing and implementing the monetary policy. Dear participants,  I tried to give a short overview of our work in the last years. I am sure than the speakers’ presentations and discussions in this conference will help us to better understand certain issues and provide the answer to several questions.  I truly believe all the participants will be active by bringing and focusing on new aspects, different experience and alternative perspectives to our viewpoints. I wish you good proceedings.

Randall S Kroszner: Loan modifications and foreclosure prevention  Testimony by Mr Randall S Kroszner, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, before the Committee on Financial Services, US House of Representatives, Washington DC, 6 December 2007. *      *      * Chairman Frank, Ranking Member Bachus, and members of the Committee, I appreciate the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss recent problems in the subprime mortgage market and possible legislative responses. The challenges facing the housing market at the moment are significant. Increasing numbers of homeowners and communities are experiencing problems. We continue to work to find and implement the best and most sustainable solutions to the current challenges.  Background In recent years, the subprime market has grown dramatically, enabling more and more borrowers to obtain credit who traditionally would have been unable to access it. Increasing numbers of lenders entered this market, with underwriting standards, industry practices, and risk-based pricing evolving along with the subprime market. The growth of this market is well recognized. Also well recognized are the problems that have arisen with these changes. The Board believes that responsible subprime lending has an important role to play in expanding credit to traditionally underserved borrowers. It also recognizes, however, that some of the lending undertaken in recent years was neither responsible nor prudent.  Mortgage delinquency and foreclosure rates have increased substantially over the past few months. Over 17 percent of subprime adjustable-rate mortgages were in serious delinquency at the end of September, a rate over three times higher than that in mid-2005. Serious delinquencies also increased among near-prime and prime mortgages, although these delinquencies remain much lower than among subprime mortgages. Lenders initiated foreclosure proceedings for an average of 320,000 loans per quarter in the first half of this year, up from 240,000 loans per quarter in the preceding two years. One significant factor in the increase in delinquency rates has been the slowing of house prices. Prices decreased slightly for the nation as a whole in the third quarter of 2007, and declined more dramatically in some regions. Over a quarter of homeowners report that their houses decreased in value over the past year, just a bit above the level last seen in the early 1990s.1 These price changes will affect homeowners' abilities to resolve financial troubles by refinancing their mortgages or pulling equity out of their homes, and may lead to increased defaults. In addition, some borrowers whose mortgage balances exceed their house values may be tempted to walk away from their loans. Borrowers who purchased properties solely for investment purposes may be more likely to default in this situation; indeed, the Mortgage Bankers' Association has found a disproportionate share of serious delinquencies are associated with non-owner-occupied properties in some of the states with the highest increases in delinquencies. A recently released study by the Federal Reserve Bank of                                                  1  Reuters/University of Michigan Survey of Consumers, November 2007. BIS Review 146/2007 1 
Boston attributes most of the recent rise in foreclosures in Massachusetts to declining house prices.2Borrowers who have lost their jobs, not surprisingly, may have difficulty meeting their mortgage payments. Thus, increases in unemployment in certain areas, such as states in the Midwest struggling with job cuts in the auto industry, are another major factor contributing to higher delinquency rates. The final major factor explaining the current increase in delinquency rates is the apparent deterioration in underwriting standards beginning in late 2005. An increasing number of subprime loans were made with layers of additional risk factors, such as a lack of full documentation or very high loan-to-value ratios. Much of this weakening in underwriting standards happened outside of institutions regulated by the federal banking agencies. For instance, in 2006, over 45 percent of high-cost first mortgages were originated by independent mortgage companies.3 In addition, prior to late 2005, high demand for housing and rising house prices allowed borrowers to recover from these risks through profitable home sales and refinancings, hiding the weakened underwriting standards from view. The slowdown in house prices, coupled with shifts in underwriting standards, are the most likely explanation for the pronounced rise we have seen in defaults occurring within a few months of origination, before most borrowers would have experienced significant changes in their payment obligations or in their financial situations. Looking forward, we expect the substantial payment increases often experienced at the first interest-rate reset to result in higher delinquencies. From now until the end of next year, each quarter roughly one out of ten borrowers with an adjustable-rate subprime mortgage is scheduled to experience the first rate reset.4 In addition, tightening credit conditions as reported in the Federal Reserve's Senior Loan Officer Surveys suggest that refinancing may become more difficult. In the past, many borrowers experiencing these resets were able to avoid the payment increases by refinancing their mortgages. The recent declines in house prices and the current tighter credit conditions, however, reduced the viability of this option for significant numbers of borrowers. The Federal Reserve's response to problems in the subprime market  As I testified before this Committee in October, the Federal Reserve is actively working to respond to these challenges. If the benefits of homeownership are to be realized, we believe that homeownership must be sustainable and that access to responsible lending be available for consumers. To achieve this, the Board believes that there must be appropriate consumer protection and responsible lending to traditionally underserved borrowers. Accordingly, we continue to coordinate with other federal and state agencies, and consult with consumer advocates, lenders, investors, and others. We take these issues very seriously, and, along with the other federal banking regulators, began issuing guidance on subprime lending in 1999 for the institutions we regulate. We significantly expanded that guidance in 2001, issued guidance on non-traditional mortgage products (such as payment-option and interest-only loans) in 2006, and issued guidance on adjustable-rate subprime mortgages earlier this year. I would like to take this opportunity to share a brief update on some of the work that the Federal Reserve is undertaking on these issues.                                                   2  Kristopher Gerardi, Adam Hale Shapiro, and Paul Willen, "Subprime Outcomes: Risky Mortgages, Homeownership Experiences, and Foreclosures,” Federal Reserve Bank of Boston Working Paper 07-15, 2007. 3  2006 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data. 4  Federal Reserve Board staff calculations based on data from First American LoanPerformance. 2 BIS Review 146/2007 
Coordinated enforcement of consumer protection laws First, the enforcement of consumer protection laws and regulations is critical and the Federal Reserve enforces these measures through oversight of the institutions it examines. As the mortgage industry has diversified, increasing coordination among regulators has been helpful. In particular, our need to cooperate with state bank regulators has increased in importance, and we have responded to that need. In that vein, we launched a cooperative pilot project with other federal and state agencies to conduct reviews of certain non-depository lenders involved in the subprime market.  The reviews will evaluate underwriting standards, risk-management strategies, and compliance with certain consumer protection laws and regulations. This initiative brings together the Federal Reserve, the Office of Thrift Supervision, the Federal Trade Commission, and state agencies represented by the Conference of State Banking Supervisors (CSBS) and the American Association of Residential Mortgage Regulators (AARMR). The companies being reviewed include those that are supervised by the federal agencies, as well as independent entities that are licensed by the states.  Loss mitigation efforts Second, the Board, along with the other federal financial agencies, has worked to guide federally supervised institutions as they deal with mortgage defaults and delinquencies. The federal financial institution agencies issued a Statement on Working with Mortgage Borrowers in April 2007, and, in cooperation with the CSBS, a Statement on Loss Mitigation Strategies for Servicers of Residential Mortgages in September 2007. Together, these statements encourage institutions to work proactively with borrowers who may be facing delinquency or foreclosure, and encourage servicers of securitized residential mortgages to determine the full extent of their authority to restructure failing loans and to pursue appropriate loss mitigation strategies. The Board continues to encourage servicers and investors to make every effort to keep troubled borrowers in their homes. I, and other members of the Board, have had numerous meetings in recent months with a wide array of market participants and consumer advocates to understand the complexity of the issues and to encourage appropriate responses. Each of the twelve Federal Reserve Banks has been working with financial institutions and community groups around the country to address challenges posed by loan performance problems. And the Federal Reserve Board's staff has been working with consumer and community affairs groups throughout the Federal Reserve System to help identify localities that are most at risk of high foreclosures, with the intent to help local groups better focus their outreach efforts to borrowers. We have also been talking with lenders, servicers and investors, independently as well as through the Hope Now alliance, to support prudent efforts to reach out to as many borrowers as possible. Many servicers have established procedures to identify segments of borrowers who are current but could face trouble at reset, to contact these borrowers ahead of the reset, and to systematically evaluate the ability of borrowers to make higher payments. On the basis of this analysis, they can sometimes present prudent refinancing or loan modification alternatives to the borrower. Other efforts, such as the FHASecure product and various state and local efforts, can play a role in avoiding foreclosure. As I will discuss further in a moment, we support these efforts because foreclosure is generally the worst possible option for consumers, investors, and communities, and should be avoided whenever other viable options exist. Changes to existing terms, however, should not be made lightly, should be consistent with safe and sound lending practices, and should not be made when they are only delaying losses to investors and consumers. In short, we should pursue sustainable solutions.  BIS Review 146/2007 3 
Consumer protection regulations  Finally, the Board continues to work toward more effective consumer protection rules. We will soon begin extensive consumer testing to ensure that new disclosures are effective and comprehensible. Later this month, we will propose changes to the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) rules to require earlier disclosures by lenders and to address concerns about misleading mortgage loan advertisements. The Board recognizes, however, that improved disclosures are necessary but not sufficient to address the problems. In addition to these actions, therefore, the Federal Reserve will exercise its rulemaking authority under the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (HOEPA) to address unfair or deceptive mortgage lending practices. At the same time we propose the TILA rule changes on advertising and timing of disclosures, we will issue, for public comment, significant new rules that would apply to subprime loans offered by all mortgage lenders. In formulating our proposal, we are looking closely at practices in the subprime mortgage market, such as prepayment penalties, failure to offer escrow accounts for taxes and insurance, stated-income and low-documentation lending, and the failure to give adequate consideration to a borrower's ability to repay.  I can assure you that our proposed rules will be based on detailed analyses of the issues and our statutory authority to address them, extraordinary outreach efforts to gather a wide range of information and opinions, and attempts to balance the needs of adequately protecting consumers and maintaining responsible lending markets. The rules will reflect input obtained through public meetings in 2006 and a hearing that dealt specifically with these issues that I chaired this past June. We also considered nearly 100 comment letters, following the June meeting, and consulted with other federal and state agencies and our own Consumer Advisory Council. Finally, we have continued to meet with, and listen to informed opinions from, consumer groups, the financial services industry, lawmakers, and others to ensure that our proposed rules are likely to achieve the goal of adequate consumer protection without shutting off access to responsible credit. Legislative responses Congress has expressed understandable and appropriate concern about subprime lending and the challenges in the mortgage market more generally. We commend leaders in Congress who are looking into these problems and wrestling with the challenges of addressing abusive lending while encouraging responsible lending.  The Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act of 2007, which was passed by the House of Representatives last month, would extend additional oversight and consumer protections to the market. We were asked in today's testimony to comment on two issues, not addressed in the current version of the Act, that could be addressed through amendments or other actions. Loan modifications One issue is the possible legal exposure of servicers of mortgages who enter into loan modifications or workout plans. Because loan servicers play a critical role in implementing possible loss mitigation strategies, this is a timely and important question.  We believe that investors and servicers generally want to work with borrowers to avoid foreclosure. Prudent loss mitigation techniques that avoid foreclosure not only help homeowners, they are usually cost-effective for investors. Borrowers who have been current in their payments but could default after reset, for instance, may be able to work with their lender or servicer to adjust their payments or otherwise change their loans to make them more manageable. Working with borrowers before they experience payment problems has other benefits; for instance, late payments will not have affected such borrowers' credit 4 BIS Review 146/2007 
scores, preserving a wider range of options including refinancing. Such proactive outreach by servicers may mean the difference between loan payment and default, particularly for lower-income families who may have little financial cushion.  Given the substantial number of resets expected from now through the end of 2008, it is in the interest of the industry to go further than it has historically to join together and explore collaborative, creative efforts to develop prudent loan modification programs and other assistance to help large groups of borrowers systematically. Such programs can streamline and speed the process of anticipating and addressing delinquent loans, reduce transaction costs, and provide guidance to borrowers and to mortgage counselors. Many servicers are, in fact, working with counselors who can play a crucial role in helping homeowners, many of whom do not even communicate with their servicers out of fear, embarrassment, or misinformation about their options. Loan modification programs should be a bottom-up approach designed to balance the needs of all parties, and we are encouraged by the progress being made by the industry in advancing such programs.  Because systematic approaches to dealing with troubled loans are often likely to lead to better aggregate investor returns than foreclosures, we are encouraged by industry efforts to pursue these approaches. When servicers modify loans, however, they may face potential litigation risk from investors because of their contractual obligations under the servicing agreements. One particular source of litigation risk, we understand, may be that different asset classes have conflicting interests. Therefore, we encourage ongoing industry efforts to agree to standards for addressing these issues. We are hopeful that the industry can resolve these conflicts on a consensual basis so that they do not preclude servicers from taking actions that are in the overall best interests of consumers and the industry.  More generally, the Board supports efforts by the industry and others to develop reasonable and standardized approaches to dealing with these challenges. Such approaches, when applied consistently and predictably, can reduce uncertainty and ultimately help the markets function. Prudent workout arrangements that are consistent with safe and sound lending practices are generally in the long-term best interest of both the financial institution and the borrower, but there may be instances when such arrangements are not prudent or appropriate. In trying to help homeowners, we must also be careful to recognize the existing legal rights of investors, avoid actions that may have the unintended consequence of disrupting the orderly functioning of the market, or unnecessarily reducing future access to credit. Provisions intended to immunize servicers from liability should be crafted to avoid creating moral hazard of parties disregarding their contractual obligations, which would ultimately have negative impacts for markets and consumers. Sustainable solutions, and not those that simply hide for the short term real repayment challenges, should be our goal.  Patterns or practices of violations A second issue is the possible imposition of civil money penalties when the enforcement agencies find that there is a pattern or practice of violations. Penalties collected would be used to establish a trust fund for those consumers whose interests had been harmed but who lack a remedy in the event, for instance, that the responsible party has gone out of business. The proper magnitude for any such penalties, or under what circumstances they should be imposed, is Congress' decision to make. As a general rule, the Board believes that penalties for any violation of law should be sufficient to deter the prohibited conduct, and also reasonably related to the injury caused by the violation. Penalties that are clearly articulated, and that reasonably match the magnitude of the violation, are the most appropriate and effective forms of deterrence.  We would recommend that the amount of such civil money penalties, if imposed, be given a ceiling as well as a floor because of the market uncertainty that can be introduced by open-ended liability. We would also suggest that some discretion in the actual amount of the BIS Review 146/2007 5 
penalty, within such a range, be given to the enforcing agencies. This sort of flexibility in enforcement would help the agencies adjust the punishment to fit the infraction. The proposed increase in civil money penalties draws attention to the critical role that enforcement plays in ensuring compliance with the new responsibilities enacted by Congress. But the effectiveness of increased penalties can be diminished by a lack of enforcement resources. As Congress weighs the merits of the bill and possible amendments, we would encourage you to also look at the resource needs of the agencies that are authorized to take enforcement actions to ensure that sufficient resources for this important role are available.  Conclusion The Board recognizes the magnitude of the challenges facing mortgage borrowers today. We understand the uncertainty and harm being experienced by consumers across the country as the housing market challenges continue. We are engaged in an array of activities to respond to these concerns. In coming weeks, we will propose new rules regarding advertising, the timing of disclosures, and practices that we find to be unfair or deceptive under our HOEPA authority, all of which we believe will offer increasing protection to consumers. We look forward to continuing to work with Congress to achieve sustainable solutions to challenges in the mortgage market.  6 BIS Review 146/2007 
Malcolm D Knight: European financial integration in the context of current financial market turbulence Keynote remarks by Mr Malcolm D Knight, General Manager of the Bank for International Settlements, at the 2007 Eurofi Conference “Achieving the integration of European financial markets in a global context”, Brussels, 3 December 2007. *      *      * Let me thank you for the opportunity to address this distinguished group of executives and policymakers. Eurofi is playing a leading role in identifying key strategic issues that need to be addressed to advance further towards the fundamental goal of achieving comprehensive financial integration in Europe, and of promoting a closer dialogue between market participants and policymakers and in particular financial regulators. In my brief remarks tonight I want first to underscore several important achievements of financial integration in Europe thus far that are key to its further progress. Then I will outline several features of the current international financial market turmoil that have implications for the future progress of European financial integration. Finally, I will comment on how the preliminary lessons from the financial disturbances we are currently witnessing may be important in shaping the ongoing process of financial integration in coming years. European financial integration The achievements of European financial integration over the past two decades are truly impressive. Prior to the advent of the euro in 1999, European authorities took deep and successful steps to stabilise cross-country exchange rates and eliminate controls on international capital movements within what is now the euro zone. The introduction of the single currency less than nine years ago has led to an acceleration of financial integration by eliminating intra-zone exchange rate risk and achieving low and stable inflation. Indeed, the establishment of a common currency backed by a European Central Bank with a clear monetary policy mandate and underpinned by firm fiscal rules has helped to clarify policy responsibilities and make more transparent the structure of this huge multi-country economic region. This has had the expected positive effect on European economies and, indeed, on global markets. Over the past two decades, inflation in what are now the euro area countries has come down substantially, nominal interest rates have fallen, and inflation expectations have become well anchored at low and stable levels. As a result of these achievements, the European Central Bank has rapidly established itself as a key and credible institution in global financial markets. In itself, this move towards greater macroeconomic stability has boosted European financial integration. From the earliest years of the euro, issuance of corporate debt securities surged, supported by the elimination of exchange rate risk within the currency zone and higher demand from a larger pool of investors. Likewise, a deep euro area-wide interbank money market developed rapidly. This is a key component – indeed, perhaps the key component – of the financial infrastructure of the euro zone. Its rapid development owes much to the major efforts of the European Central Bank in elaborating its monetary policy procedures and its liquidity operations. To be sure, European financial integration has not proceeded at the same pace across all sectors and markets. Integration of the retail banking markets, for instance, has remained limited, reflecting the persistence of legal, institutional and regulatory differences. But things are moving. Even a cursory reading of the financial press shows that financial integration is making visible progress almost day by day. BIS Review 146/2007 1 
The current financial market turmoil But how does the current turmoil in global financial markets impact on the positive picture that I have just sketched for you? Let me recall that this turmoil follows a prolonged period of broadly based and aggressive risk-taking that was reflected in unusually low risk premia and low volatility across many asset classes. Thus, prior to last summer, many careful observers believed that the price of risk was too low – so an increase in risk premia was widely seen as healthy from a financial stability perspective.  There was a large element of wisdom in this point of view. Nevertheless, when risk aversion suddenly jumped last summer there were major surprises. A first surprise was that a shock in one specific segment of the mortgage sector in the United States led to severe adverse effects not only in that country, but also in the euro zone, the United Kingdom and Canada. The impact in the euro zone was a surprise to many observers because increasing financial integration had greatly strengthened the European financial system.  A second surprise was the sudden evaporation of liquidity in the major interbank markets, which has persisted since the summer and which has transmitted the tensions in credit markets to the very heart of the international financial system. The distortions in the interbank money markets have occurred mainly in the United States, the euro zone and a few other key economies, such as the United Kingdom. They are much less severe in Japan; and major emerging market economies have weathered the global turmoil relatively well so far. In the euro area, the spread between the market expectation of the overnight interest rate during the next three months (the EONIA swap interest rate) and the rate at which commercial banks can borrow from each other over the same period – the three-month Libor rate – suddenly jumped in August and has stayed elevated since, while it is usually a few basis points only. Indeed, this spread has been widening again since early November, to around 75 bp today. Since the interbank credit markets are uncollateralised, this large premium presumably reflects increased liquidity and credit risk concerns, even among the largest banks. Liquidity and credit risk  What are the main causes behind this unexpected upsurge in liquidity risk and credit risk? I would stress two key factors: information failures in credit markets; and weaknesses in the “originate-and-distribute” business model adopted in recent years by large internationally active banks. First, the opacity of certain parts of the global financial marketplace, particularly the markets for structured financial products and the off-balance sheet vehicles designed to hold them (the now famous “conduits” and SIVs), has led to a sudden collapse of confidence in asset valuations and a generalised distrust of counterparties. As a result, market participants now wonder about the size and character of banks’ exposures – including those of large European banks – because of the existence of explicit or implicit backup credit lines to a wide variety of market players. Beginning last summer, this crisis of confidence triggered an evaporation of market liquidity for the instruments concerned and a funding liquidity squeeze for those institutions that were suspected of being vulnerable to them. Second, weaknesses in the “originate-and-distribute” business model of the large banks, primarily in the United States and Europe. There are some very positive aspects of this model, since it helps to diversify banks’ revenue streams and risks. But the operation of this model in recent years has been associated with an excessive relaxation in standards of credit origination and credit monitoring in the financial system as a whole. As a result of the current turmoil, the originators and securitisers of complex financial instruments have become – in many cases to their own surprise – the “holders of last resort” of the more exotic credit products. This development has also underlined weaknesses in the risk management practices of investors, who underpriced the risks concerned and relied excessively on 2 BIS Review 146/2007 
external ratings for monitoring risk. And it has demonstrated that the wider distribution of risk across the financial system, if not supported by transparency and market discipline, makes it difficult to gauge the risk exposures of market participants. The combination of these two factors – inadequate public information in credit markets and weaknesses in the way credit risk has been distributed in the market – helps to explain why the current turbulence has primarily affected the interbank markets at the core of our modern global financial system and why this weakness was not foreseen before last summer. Because they were focusing on the balance sheets of the regulated banking institutions, observers wrongly underestimated the actual degree of leverage in the financial system as a whole – I mean all the leverage generated not only by the activities of commercial banks, but also by highly leveraged institutions, SIVs, conduits, LBO-financed firms, etc; that is, the leverage of all institutions that, implicitly or not, was predicated on backup credit lines being provided by regulated institutions in times of stress. Looking forward I believe that the financial integration that has taken place in the euro zone since the advent of the euro in 1999 has contributed importantly to a remarkable rise in living standards and greater financial and economic stability. It follows that continued financial integration is essential to further the remarkable progress of Europe. So the question is: what lessons should we draw from the current financial turbulence that can help to make the future course of European financial integration both stronger and more immune to financial disturbances at its core? I do not pretend to have an answer to this question – at least not yet. But in closing let me offer just four thoughts that are relevant to it. First, firm euro zone monetary policy will continue to play a key role in fostering further European financial integration. The European Central Bank has shown great success in maintaining an appropriate monetary stance while at the same time fine-tuning its liquidity operations in the interbank market so as to ensure that its overnight rate remains broadly on target, and that monetary conditions continue to be set effectively given prevailing macroeconomic conditions. And the ECB has also been a leading central bank in taking action to address dislocations in the longer-term interbank money markets, even though this has proven difficult to realise given that the term premium comes from banks’ own uncertainties about liquidity and counterparty risks. My second thought is that there is clearly a need for greater transparency in financial markets on both sides of the Atlantic. This can take many forms. One is to reduce product complexity: I expect to see more emphasis on financial assets – including structured products – that have simpler features to make them less illiquid in difficult market conditions. Another is more refined rating scales for these assets, giving investors a better sense of their risk characteristics. There are signs that this is already happening in the marketplace, as rating agencies and market participants adjust their methodologies for assessing and rating risk. Third, there is a need for improvement in risk management practices – not least liquidity management by financial firms; standards of credit origination; and monitoring of the debt servicing performance of borrowers. Experience suggests that prior to the current turbulence investors underestimated the tail risks to which they were exposed, including the interdependencies between credit, market and liquidity risks. Improvements in stress testing can play a key role here. Needless to say, such stress tests should consider the cross-country nature of the euro area financial system. Finally, greater financial stability calls for closer communication and cooperation among players in the financial system, not just within the official sector, but also between the official and private sectors. This is especially true in the euro area given its multiplicity of jurisdictions and layers of responsibility, which puts a premium on cooperation. Meetings like BIS Review 146/2007 3 
this suggest that the lesson is well understood by all the parties involved. This can only augur well for the future. 4 BIS Review 146/2007 
European Central Bank: Press conference – introductory statement Introductory statement by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank and Mr Lucas Papademos, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, Frankfurt am Main, 6 December 2007. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to today’s press conference. Let me report on the outcome of our meeting, which was also attended by the President of the Eurogroup, Prime Minister Juncker, and Commissioner Almunia.  On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided at today’s meeting to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The latest information has confirmed the existence of strong short-term upward pressure on inflation, with the HICP inflation rate reaching 3.0% in November. It has also fully confirmed our assessment that there are upside risks to price stability over the medium term. Against this background, and with money and credit growth remaining very vigorous in the euro area, the Governing Council stands ready to counter upside risks to price stability, as required by its mandate. The economic fundamentals of the euro area remain sound. However, the reappraisal of risk in financial markets is still evolving and is accompanied by continued uncertainty about the potential impact on the real economy. We will therefore monitor very closely all developments. By acting in a firm and timely manner on the basis of our assessment, we will ensure that second-round effects and risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. Firmly anchoring medium and long-term inflation expectations in line with price stability is all the more important at times of financial market volatility and increased uncertainty. As regards the financial markets, we will continue to pay great attention to developments over the coming weeks. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis.  According to Eurostat’s first estimate, the quarter-on-quarter growth rate of euro area real GDP in the third quarter of 2007 was 0.7%, in line with the earlier flash estimate. Domestic demand remained the main driver of economic growth in the third quarter, confirming the sustained nature of economic expansion in the euro area. The latest information on economic activity from various confidence surveys and indicator-based estimates supports the assessment that economic growth has continued into the fourth quarter of this year, though probably at a more moderate pace than in the third quarter. Overall, the fundamentals of the euro area remain sound. Profitability has been sustained, employment growth has been robust and the unemployment rate has fallen to levels not seen for 25 years.  These factors are also reflected in the December 2007 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections. Annual real GDP growth is projected to lie in the range of 2.4% to 2.8% in 2007, and be between 1.5% and 2.5% in 2008, and between 1.6% and 2.6% in 2009. In comparison with the September ECB staff projections, the range projected for real GDP growth in 2008 has been revised slightly downwards, whereas for 2007 the new range lies within the upper part of the previous one. Available forecasts from international organisations broadly confirm this outlook.  The scenario of sustained real GDP growth broadly in line with trend potential is based on the expectation that the global economy will remain resilient, with the slowdown of economic growth in the United States partly offset by the continued strength of emerging market economies. External demand should therefore provide ongoing support to euro area exports and investment. Consumption growth should also contribute to economic expansion, in line with developments in real disposable income, as continued employment growth provides supportive conditions. That said, in view of the potential impact of ongoing financial market volatility and re-pricing of risk on the real economy, the level of uncertainty remains high.  BIS Review 145/2007 1 
In the Governing Council’s view, the risks surrounding this outlook for economic growth lie on the downside. They relate mainly to the potential for a broader impact from the ongoing reappraisal of risk in financial markets on financing conditions and confidence and on world and euro area growth, possible further oil and commodity price rises, as well as concerns about protectionist pressures and possible disorderly developments owing to global imbalances.50  As regards price developments, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, the annual HICP inflation rate increased sharply again in November 2007, to 3.0% from 2.6% in October. Oil prices have risen strongly in recent months, and food prices have increased substantially, reflecting higher global demand. In addition, as emphasised on previous occasions, we are currently in the midst of a period in which unfavourable effects from energy prices are having a strong upward impact on annual HICP inflation rates, owing to the marked decline in oil prices a year ago. Looking ahead, the HICP inflation rate is expected to remain significantly above 2% in the coming months, and is likely to moderate only gradually in the course of 2008. Hence, the period of temporarily high rates of inflation would be somewhat more protracted than previously expected. The December Eurosystem staff projections foresee annual HICP inflation to be between 2.0% and 2.2% in 2007, but then to rise to between 2.0% and 3.0% in 2008. For 2009, HICP inflation is projected to lie between 1.2% and 2.4%. Compared with the September 2007 ECB staff projections, the projected ranges for HICP inflation in 2007 and 2008 have shifted upwards. Forecasts from international organisations which incorporate recent inflation developments give a broadly similar picture. These projections largely mirror the assumed path of oil and food prices, for which available futures prices suggest a deceleration in the course of next year. On the domestic side, unit labour cost growth is projected to increase over the projection horizon. In this context it is important to emphasise that the staff projections assume that recent oil and food price dynamics and their impact on HICP inflation will not have broadly-based second-round effects on wage-setting behaviour. This is a key assumption. A further key assumption is that growth in profit margins will moderate over the projection horizon. In combination, these two assumptions imply, in the context of the staff projections, a continuation of overall contained domestic cost pressures, which contributes to the moderation in inflation projected in 2009.  In the Governing Council’s view, risks to this medium-term outlook for price developments are fully confirmed to lie on the upside. These risks include the possibility of further rises in oil and agricultural prices, continuing the strong momentum observed in recent months, as well as increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those foreseen thus far. Moreover, taking into account the existence of capacity constraints, the favourable momentum of real GDP growth observed over the past few quarters and the positive developments in labour markets, stronger than currently expected wage growth may emerge. Furthermore, an increase in pricing power in market segments with low competition could materialise. It is therefore crucial that all parties concerned meet their responsibilities and that second-round effects on wage and price-setting stemming from recent commodity price rises be avoided. To that end, any explicit or de facto indexation of nominal wages to prices should be eliminated.  The monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons. Money and credit have both continued to grow vigorously in recent months. The annual growth rate of M3 in October, at 12.3%, is likely to have been influenced by a number of temporary factors, such as the flattening of the yield curve, the financial market turmoil and specific transactions associated with the restructuring of certain banking groups. However, even taking these special factors into account, the underlying rate of monetary expansion remains strong. Moreover, the sustained expansion of loans to the domestic private sector, which grew at an annual rate of 11.2% in October, points to the 2 BIS Review 145/2007 
continued vigour of underlying monetary dynamics. Monetary developments therefore continue to require very careful monitoring, both to detect underlying trends associated with inflationary pressures at longer horizons and to better understand shorter-term dynamics.  Such monitoring will also provide a more complete picture of the response of the private sector to the increased volatility in financial markets. A broad assessment of underlying trends in money and credit growth is particularly important at present given recent financial market developments. Heightened financial volatility may influence the short-term behaviour of money-holders and thereby complicate the extraction of the underlying trend monetary developments. At the same time, monetary and credit data can also offer an important insight into how financial institutions, households and firms have responded to the financial market turmoil.  For the time being, however, there is little evidence that the financial market turbulence since early August has strongly influenced the dynamics of broad money and credit aggregates, although specific balance sheet items, such as holdings of money market fund shares/units, may have been affected. Indeed, the growth of bank loans to households and non-financial corporations has remained robust in recent months, which may suggest that the supply of credit has not been impaired. Further data and analysis will be required to develop a more complete view of the impact of the financial market developments on bank balance sheets, financing conditions and money and credit growth. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis fully confirms the assessment that there are upside risks to price stability over the medium term, in a context of vigorous money and credit growth and against the background of sound economic fundamentals in the euro area. At the same time, the reappraisal of risk in financial markets is still evolving and uncertainty about the potential impact on the real economy has continued. Consequently, the Governing Council will monitor very closely all developments. Our monetary policy stands ready to counter upside risks to price stability, as required by our mandate. In particular, for the recent increase in inflation to remain temporary, it is of the essence that no second-round effects materialise via an impact from current inflation rates on wage and price-setting behaviour. By acting in a firm and timely manner on the basis of our assessment, we will ensure that second-round effects and risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise and that medium and long-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability. This is all the more important in the current context. As regards the financial markets, we will continue to pay great attention to developments over the coming weeks. Turning to fiscal policy, the European Commission’s autumn 2007 economic forecast generally confirms the picture of improving budget balances in the euro area this year. However, progress with structural fiscal consolidation in countries with remaining budget imbalances is generally disappointing. This lack of ambition unnecessarily prolongs the correction of remaining fiscal deficits and could lead to negative surprises should the macroeconomic environment turn less favourable. In this context, Member States should meet the commitment they made in the Eurogroup’s Berlin agreement of April 2007, namely that most euro area members would achieve their medium-term objectives in 2008 or 2009, and all should aim for 2010 at the latest. With regard to structural reforms, it is important that governments continue their efforts to make progress. The improvements in the employment situation over recent years show the fruits of past reforms. It is essential that the reform momentum to enhance competition, productivity growth and labour market flexibility is maintained and that there are no reversals of the reform process in the countries of the euro area. We are now at your disposal for questions. BIS Review 145/2007 3 
Radovan Jelašić: Remittances to Serbia Speech by Mr Radovan Jelašić, Governor of the National Bank of Serbia, on the occasion of the international conference on remittances, Berlin, 29 November 2007. *      *      * Dear Mrs. Minister, Mr. Minister, Your Excellency, Ladies and Gentlemen, It would be true to say that citizens of Serbia are its main article of export since no other “article“ brings in more foreign currency than the Serbian diaspora sending remittances from abroad. This is particularly true of the Serbian diaspora in Germany as over 700,000 Serbian nationals still live there – let us be clear on this, I am referring to those still holding Serbian passports, or better to say, Yugoslav passports! Though our fellow citizens have left Serbia, and done so for various reasons of economic or political nature, in order to obtain better employment opportunities or to flee the war-torn regions, etc. – they all share a common denominator. All of them are sending money to Serbia. And, they are sending lots of it! Based on our estimates, around USD 3, 0 billion or 8.1% of the GDP was sent to Serbia in 2006, of which over USD 300 million from Germany alone! These transactions have two important aspects: social – assistance to those who had stayed behind, care for the elderly, supporting relatives, and economic – investment in the SMEs, residential building, purchase of property, investment in their own or their children’s education, etc. However, our estimates show that only half of all remittances take the formal route, i.e. reach Serbia through banking channels, which certainly has nothing to do with the quality of the banking sector in Serbia since 80% of the sector is in majority ownership of well ranked strategic owners from the EU countries - Austria, Italy, France and Greece. This means that the majority of such money is brought into Serbia by people crossing borders, which naturally has a negative impact on all those participating in such dealings: • there are side-effects to money senders in terms of undesirable costs, safety exposure and loss of tax benefits (if the aim is to support relatives);  • money recipients must pick up the money and hopefully take it to a bank, which is not a simple matter as they do not fully qualify for use of banking products, such as credit cards, mortgage loans, etc.  Why is money still being transferred in this manner? The answer lies primarily in tradition, and lack of information. For that particular reason, the web page GELDTRANSAIR.DE, which was activated today, will be of particular significance. The NBS is doing its best not only to advertise this page, but also to update its content and to provide technical support. Last but not least, I think of this page as being “ours“. Hence, I suggest that we do not focus on traditional ways of money transfer only, but give our support to alternative ways as well, e.g. money transfer via mobile phone, especially of small amounts, or via the Internet! If I were still living in Frankfurt which I left eight years ago, I would certainly be among the first users of this web page as the main source of information for transactions to Serbia. But I can see its advantages from the point of view of the National bank as well, and feel certain that we shall make the best use of its potentials. Dear Mrs. Minister and Mr. Minister, allow me to express my most sincere gratitude for all that Germany has done for the development of the democratic Serbia. Financial assistance we received from Germany over the last seven years is higher than that received from all other donors taken together. This speaks more than thousand words. Once again, thank you very much! BIS Review 145/2007 1 
Jean Claude-Trichet: Hearing at the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Parliament Speech by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, at the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Parliament, Brussels, 19 December 2007. *      *      * Madame la Présidente, Mesdames et Messieurs les membres de la Commission Economique et Monétaire, je me réjouis d'apparaître devant votre commission aujourd'hui. Je commencerai mon intervention par une évaluation de la situation économique et monétaire, en expliquant les raisons sous-jacentes à nos récentes décisions de taux. Ensuite, je vous fournirai de plus amples informations sur les opérations de politique monétaire de la BCE en réaction aux tensions enregistrées sur le marché monétaire ainsi que sur la stabilité du système financier de la zone euro. Zum abschluss möchte ich ein paar Anmerkungen zu den Auswirkungen der Globalisierung auf die Preisentwicklung sowie zu Entwicklungen im Immobiliensektor machen.  Economic and monetary developments Since my previous appearance before the European Parliament early October, incoming information has fully confirmed our view that, in a context of vigorous money and credit growth and sound economic fundamentals in the euro area, the risks to price stability over the medium term are clearly on the upside, as I have said, on behalf of the Governing Council, after our meeting on Thursday, 6 December. The recent substantial increase in oil and food prices, together with unfavourable base effects from energy prices, owing to the marked decline in oil prices a year ago, are having a strong upward impact on inflation in the current context. Looking ahead, the inflation rate is expected to remain significantly above 2% in the near future, and it is likely to moderate only gradually in the course of 2008. Hence the period of temporarily high inflation rates would be somewhat more protracted than previously expected.  Looking further ahead, the December Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections foresee annual HICP inflation to be between 2.0% and 2.2% in 2007, to then rise to between 2.0% and 3.0% in 2008, before moderating to a range of 1.2% and 2.4% in 2009. Compared with the September staff projections, the ranges for 2007 and 2008 have shifted upwards. These staff projections are based on two key assumptions. The first is that recent oil and food price dynamics and their impact on HICP inflation will not have broadly-based second-round effects on wage-setting behaviour. The second key assumption is that growth in profit margins will moderate over the projection horizon. These two assumptions imply, in the context of the staff projections, a continuation of overall contained domestic cost pressures, which contributes to the moderation in inflation projected in 2009. It is the view of the Governing Council that the risks to this medium-term outlook for price developments are fully confirmed to lie on the upside, mainly relating to possible further rises in oil and agricultural prices, increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those foreseen thus far. In addition, against the background of sound economic fundamentals, stronger than currently expected wage dynamics may emerge, while an increase in pricing power in market segments with low competition could materialise. As regards economic activity, incoming information confirms the sustained nature of economic expansion in the euro area, with real GDP growing by 0.7% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter, while indicating some moderation in the fourth quarter. Overall, the economic fundamentals in the euro area remain sound. Looking ahead, Eurosystem staff BIS Review 151/2007 1 
projects annual real GDP growth to lie between 2.4% to 2.8% in 2007, between 1.5% and 2.5% in 2008, and between 1.6% and 2.6% in 2009. In comparison with the September 2007 ECB staff projections, the range projected for real GDP growth in 2008 has been revised slightly downwards, whereas for 2007 the new range lies within the upper part of the previous one.  This scenario is based on the expectation that the global economy will remain resilient, with the slowdown of economic growth in the United States partly offset by the continued strength of emerging market economies. However, in view of the potential impact of ongoing financial market volatility and re-pricing of risk on the real economy, this assessment remains surrounded by a high level of uncertainty. And in the Governing Council’s view, the risks surrounding this outlook for economic growth lie on the downside. The monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons. On the basis of latest available data, covering the period to the end of October, the underlying money and credit expansion remains vigourous, even taking temporary factors into account, such as the flattening of the yield curve, the financial market turmoil and specific transactions associated with the restructuring of certain banking groups. Therefore, monetary and credit developments continue to require very careful monitoring, not least with a view to better understand the response of the private sector to increased financial market volatility. Thus far, there has been little evidence that the financial market turbulence since early August has strongly influenced the dynamics of broad money and credit aggregates. Indeed, the expansion of loans to households and non-financial corporations has remained robust, which may suggest that the supply of credit has not been impaired. To develop a more complete view of the impact of financial market developments on bank balance sheets, financing conditions and money and credit growth, further data and analysis will be required. The ECB’s Governing Council stands ready to counter upside risks to price stability, in line with its mandate. Against this background, on 6 December we decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The Governing Council will monitor very closely all developments. In particular, for the recent increase in inflation to remain temporary, it is essential that the price and wage-setting behaviour remains unaffected by current inflation rates, so as to avoid the emergence of second-round effects. By acting in a firm and timely manner on the basis of its assessment, the Governing Council will ensure that such second-round effects and risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. To firmly anchor inflation expectations in line with price stability is even more important at times of financial market volatility and increased uncertainty. In this respect, the Governing Council will continue to pay great attention to financial market developments. Monetary policy operations Ladies and gentlemen, once the Governing Council has defined the monetary policy stance necessary for maintaining price stability in the medium term, in line with its mandate as defined by the Treaty, the ECB has the responsibility to also ensure the smooth functioning of the segment of the money market that we influence. I should like to underline – once again – that these two responsibilities are clearly distinct and should not be mixed.  Since we last met in October, tensions continued to be observed and during the last period banks expressed concerns about their liquidity needs over the year-end. The new-year period is traditionally a period of scarce liquidity, as market activity is subdued and banks are preparing their year-end balance sheets.  In its open market operations, the ECB therefore pursued its endeavour to contribute to the smooth functioning of the euro money market. In particular, we renewed our two supplementary long-term refinancing operations and lengthened the maturity of the main refinancing operation settling on 19 December from one to two weeks, thus facilitating the 2 BIS Review 151/2007 
coverage of the year-end liquidity needs of banks. For this specific operation, we announced that we would satisfy all bids received at 4.21 percent or above, the 4.21 percent level being the weighted average rate of the previous main refinancing operation one week before. This announcement was consistent with our earlier communication and actions. It aims at minimising the uncertainty banks face when bidding at this operation which is covering the end of the year, and at keeping interest rates close to the ECB’s minimum bid rate.  In the main refinancing operations since the beginning of August the ECB allotted significantly larger amounts of liquidity than under normal circumstances with an aim to limit the volatility of very short term rates around the ECB’s minimum bid rate. These large amounts of liquidity have always been absorbed later on during the maintenance period so that the ECB has only provided banks with the liquidity needed for the fulfilment of their reserve requirements on average over the maintenance periods. Let me also underline that we only provide such operations against solid collateral, as always. Overall, the ECB’s actions permitted to maintain very short-term rates close to the ECB’s policy rate. The tensions, which are observed in the longer term money market rates are due in particular to the persistence of uncertainties surrounding the financial health and liquidity needs of financial institutions as well as the impact of the ongoing global financial market correction, with a general re-appreciation of risks. Under these tense circumstances, let me mention that, by reducing the volatility of the very short-term rates around the key policy rate of the ECB and by containing pressures in the interbank term money market, the ECB’s monetary policy operations have contributed to a better resilience of the European financial system without – of course – eliminating the causes of the tensions, originating outside the money market.  During this period, the Eurosystem remained, as usual, in close contact with other major central banks. In this context, on 12 December the ECB, the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, the Bank of Canada and the Swiss National Bank announced measures designed to address elevated pressures in short-term funding markets. In particular, the ECB participates in joint action with the Federal Reserve and the Swiss national Bank. The ECB will offer up to a total of 20 billion US dollar in two auctions to Eurosystem counterparties against ECB-eligible collateral.  Through its own actions as well as the joint efforts with other central banks, the Eurosystem as well as the community of central banks have shown their capacity to cope with a number of challenges that euro and global money markets are currently facing. More than ever, in these periods of tensions, lucidity in the diagnosis, rapidity in the decision, and absence of complacency are of the essence. This absence of complacency is particularly necessary as regards financial stability. Financial stability  I would now like to share with you our assessment of the financial stability situation, as described in the recent Financial Stability Review. I will discuss briefly the role of financial institutions and supervisory authorities in coping with the present financial market correction.  With financial systems undergoing a process of de-leveraging and re-intermediation, uncertainty surrounding the financial stability outlook for the euro area has heightened and may persist until it becomes clearer how the potential balance sheet effects of the turbulence will be spread across individual financial institutions. Clarity is also needed concerning liquidity commitments to off-balance sheet vehicles, and the magnitude of assets that may be re-intermediated back onto the balance sheets of euro area financial institutions. The process of improving clarity, which started when Q3 2007 financial statements became available, will be advanced further when institutions publish their annual audited accounts for 2007 as a whole.  BIS Review 151/2007 3 
Given the uncertainties, the adjustment process in the financial system in the coming period may be challenging, and we have to be prepared to the materialisation of risks at any time. That being said, there are mitigating factors including a broadly favourable economic outlook, the largely sound balance sheets of households and firms, and the generally sound capital positions of core financial firms. This should not, however, provide any grounds for complacency given the heightened uncertainties. In a fluid environment where financial system conditions may unexpectedly change, prudence is of the essence both for policymakers and financial institutions.  Concerning the role of financial institutions and supervisory authorities in coping with the financial turmoil, I would submit three observations. First, given the underlying factors of the financial stress, and in order to re-establish confidence within the financial system, it is crucial to promote a widespread consistent valuation of complex structured products as well as an adequate disclosure by banks of their exposures, in particular related to the US sub-prime mortgage sector. Second, I would welcome the efforts of the supervisory community, namely through the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Committee of European Banking Supervisors, in keeping each other abreast of developments and in considering jointly possible measures to contain the potential effects of the turmoil. Third, I would underline the importance in stress situations, like the current one, of effective and smooth cooperation and exchange of information between the supervisory authorities and central banks.  As to the policy lessons to be learned in order to avoid the recurrence of similar disruptions in the future, I would say that, while it is still early to draw firm conclusions, there is a common understanding on the key issues requiring further analysis. In this respect, let me recall a few topics. First, the need for the financial industry to provide more public information about securitisation, credit risk transfer and complex structured products. Second, the need for rating agencies to review their methodologies for complex structured products and to address very seriously potential conflicts of interest. Third, the need for investors to review their investment behaviour excessively reliant on ratings. Fourth, the need for supervisors to implement the new capital framework under Basel II as rapidly and effectively as possible and to reflect on possible improvements of the framework, including the enhancements of the supervisory regime for liquidity risk. In this context, I should mention that the ECB with the assistance of the Banking Supervision Committee is carrying out work on banks’ stress-testing and contingency funding plans.  On all the issues mentioned above, work is already under way at both the international and European level. The ECB is strongly supportive of the work of the Financial Stability Forum, as well as of the European initiatives discussed in the ECOFIN Council. In this context, I would like to once again stress the importance of effective cooperation in any policy actions to be taken at the international level. The impact of globalisation on price developments Ladies and gentlemen, let me turn to the impact of globalisation on price developments. As a preface, let me say that while globalisation could influence aggregate prices in several ways, such impacts are limited to the short term given that inflation is ultimately a monetary phenomenon. The direct, and perhaps most visible effect of globalisation for consumers, is its implication for relative prices. On the one hand, globalisation has dampened increases in euro area import prices of manufactured goods given a rising share of imports from lower-cost countries such as China and the new EU Member States. On the other hand, rising demand associated with globalisation has contributed to the significant increases observed in world energy and other commodity prices. Although such relative price shocks do not necessarily affect inflation, prolonged short term impacts of sizeable relative price shocks could result, for instance, from adjustment frictions in the economy. Empirical studies for the euro area have 4 BIS Review 151/2007 
tended to suggest a small dampening influence of trade openness on prices in the early part of this decade, though globalisation’s contribution to recent movements in commodity prices – particularly energy and food – has had a significant offsetting upward impact on prices. This warrants close monitoring, in particular given the risks of second round effects. In case of food related commodities, it also underlines the importance of efficient supply side adjustment in agricultural commodity markets.  A separate but nonetheless potentially equally important channel through which globalisation can affect inflation involves the indirect price impact of increased competitive pressures, with two main aspects. First, in principle it could contribute to compressing firms’ price-cost mark-ups as competitive forces resulting from trade openness would depress profit mark-ups of domestic firms competing with international firms. In practice, however, such effects have been hard to identify and, indeed, aggregate profitability has remained high. Second, in principle competition associated with globalisation could alter the responsiveness of prices to costs or measures of economic slack, or imply a greater role for foreign conditions in the inflation process. In practice, it would appear that such responsiveness has not increased over the last decade, while empirical evidence supporting a growing role of global measures of economic slack in the inflation process of the euro area and other advanced economies has been limited.  On balance, not only is the net effect of globalisation on euro area prices difficult to accurately gauge, but it may also be changing through time. For this reason, the ECB continues to actively monitor possible ongoing changes in the inflation process. At the same time, efficient adjustment can be best facilitated by focusing on price stability and continuing to solidly anchor inflation expectations in the face of considerable relative price shocks. Developments in the real estate sector Let me conclude with some remarks on residential property prices. As with other asset prices, residential property prices are closely monitored by the ECB in terms of our economic analysis. Within this context, while we take the euro area real estate sector into account in assessing risks to price stability, we certainly do not target house prices, or for that matter, any other asset prices. We do monitor asset prices closely because of the potentially high costs for price stability and for the economy as a whole that are associated with strong appreciations and rapid reversals in asset prices. Also, our monetary analysis covers the monitoring of money and credit which often reflect the evolution of prices and house purchases. In this sense, a strategy which on top of our economic analysis regularly assesses money and credit developments has an important benefit on the monitoring side in that it can contribute to identifying and limiting the emergence of unsustainable developments in asset prices.  In terms of recent developments in the euro area real estate sector, the latest available data on house prices appears to support the notion of a cooling in euro area housing market developments after a prolonged period of unusually high growth rates in many euro area countries. That said, house price growth generally remains relatively buoyant in the euro area on average when seen in historical perspective – notwithstanding considerable heterogeneity in underlying country developments. The outlook for the euro area as a whole remains that of a soft landing, as price increases moderate gradually and further developments evolve in line with fundamentals. Within this context, a continued moderation of residential investment would also be likely.  The above economic assessment is complemented by information from our monetary assessment, in particular that the annual growth rate of loans to households was in October at 6.8%, from 7.0% in the third quarter and 7.5% in the second quarter. In this sense, there is no indication that the financial market turmoil has, as yet, limited lending to households, the moderation of which started as long ago as the second quarter of 2006. I am now at your disposal for questions. BIS Review 151/2007 5 
Rundheersing Bheenick: Thinking globally, banking locally, and branching out… Address by Professor Rundheersing Bheenick, Governor of the Bank of Mauritius, at the official opening of Grand Bay Branch of the HSBC, Grand Bay, 18 December 2007. *      *      * I’m delighted to be here, opening a new branch, of a famous bank. The history of the HSBC Group, in Mauritius, can be traced back to 1859, when the Chartered Mercantile Bank of India, London and China, established a branch in Port Louis. One well-known project, that this bank assisted in financing, was the construction of the Port Louis to Curepipe Section of the railway, in 1864. Those were the days! And how we struggle now to get back on to the fast track! Opening a new branch is always a pleasure; one only to be surpassed, for a central banker, by opening a new bank! This year we have done both. I come to open this branch, having only recently opened a newly-licensed commercial Bank in the country, and having just laid the foundation stone of a new branch of the Bank of Mauritius in Rodrigues. It is one of those habits I don’t want to break. I hope this trend, reinforced today, in our 40th anniversary year, will be continued in 2008, the 40th anniversary year of the Independence of Mauritius, bringing new life and strength to the banking sector. About this time last year, contemplating the prospect of becoming Governor of a central Bank, I speculated that my life might be even more exciting than that of James Bond. You will recall that 007 had a singular license to kill. We central bankers have a triple license, and it seems none of then come with the risks Bond was running from fast cars, faster guns, and still faster women. The dream of a central banker is first to have that wonderful Midas touch, a golden gift, at this time of the year: • The license to print money! and then he gets that really expansive gift: • The license to open new banks,  And finally the third great gift, that salutary power: • The license to close them again! But you may be pleased to know, that today, as your invited guest, on this opening day of a new branch, I have brought none of these licenses with me! I must say I am glad to be here as a guest of an expanding Bank, which has such a well-deserved worldwide reputation, as a safe pair of hands. That is good news for you and your staff; good news for your customers; and very good news for the country as a whole. I recall, from the not-so-distant past, a famous phrase in the money business. • “Safe as houses!” Do you remember that one? It just seemed to go out of use in banking circles in 2007! Safe as houses! Which is interestingly translated into French, in Harrap’s dictionary, by • “cela ne presente aucun risque”! Now there is a language lesson in great need of some urgent revision for us all, as we move together towards Basel II. BIS Review 151/2007 1 
Or dare I recall another, once timely, banking phrase? • Safe as a Bank, or, even safe as the Bank of England  Harrap’s renders that as: • “c’est de l’or en lingots” I trust this branch of this Bank will serve to revive such public faith in banking. Service to the customer must be our new gold standard, even if there remains uncertainty about our reserve currency in the future, as the dollar hovers on the brink of something we know not what! If we have learned one lesson from this traumatic year, 2007, it is that all banks need to revisit their criteria for decision-making; commercial banks in judging today’s risks, and central banks for using those triple licenses we hold on your behalf, and on that of the people of this country. In 2002, HSBC launched a campaign to differentiate its brand from those of its competitors, with that pithy phrase: “The world’s local bank” Now we do not speak for the world but you and your bank are most certainly “local” around here. In 2006, you incorporated a subsidiary in Mauritius, the HSBC Bank (Mauritius) Ltd. Thus, you are now able to enjoy a multitude of advantages, such as tax benefits and independence at the level of your Board. One does not agree to be the Governor of a central Bank to be loved; and I have not been entirely disappointed in that. Indeed, I sometimes rank my position in public life, as a central banker, little higher than that of an honest policeman, whose usefulness would disappear if there were no malefactors in the risk business. As a policeman, however, I have every confidence, that those working in this branch, will only enhance the fine reputation that HSBC has so well established in the world of banking. • A Bank, safe as houses; qui ne présente, a nous, aucun risque. We look to banks, such as yours, to save us from the contagious risks of the growing, global, credit delinquency of the past decade. This, previously subterranean, force erupted in 2007, sweeping like a terrifying tsunami, across the oceans of the banking and finance world. And we, as bankers, were, frankly, as ill-prepared, as were the tourists and hoteliers, faced with the Indian Ocean tsunami, at this festive season, just three years ago. And now as a climate change is approaching, I look to you and all our colleagues in banking, to find the courage and leadership to adapt our early warning systems and take corrective action. There are few white knights left to come to our rescue. Our destiny is in our own hands. We must never forget, that, despite our splendid buildings, and may I say your kind festive hospitality, despite these smart new surroundings, each bright new dawn, that you will see rising here over the beauties of Grand Bay, is not the herald of paradise to come, but merely a fresh light on the cold realities of the banking world. Banks are fragile institutions. Banking is a delicate business. For banks are like pretty girls and roses; they last, while they last! In the Global Business sector, HSBC is a market leader. We are all looking to such global leadership to help to move us from the tidal waves of 2007 into calmer waters in 2008. Mauritius is at a critical phase in its economic development. The country is undergoing significant reforms. Inflation is coming down into single digit, the currency is stronger, tourism and investment are growing. Banks, like yours, have a vital role to play with their potential to 2 BIS Review 151/2007 
promote the principles of sustainable development through sounder lending and wiser investment. I trust you will continue to play your undisputable role in promoting the continued social and economic welfare of this country. In Mauritius, bank branching, remains an indispensable strategy for banks. Customers view nearness to a branch as a determining factor in the choice of their banks. HSBC has thus extended its network and now has 11 branches and 13 ATMs across the country. Today, this new branch is for us, and for the people of Mauritius, a most welcome addition to the family of 20 licensed banks, with a total of 180 branches both in Mauritius and Rodrigues. I wish this infant branch a happy and profitable future. And I wish a prosperous New Year, 2008, to all your staff, in all your branches, and in your headquarters. But I especially wish prosperity to all our customers, on whose patronage, ultimately, we all depend. Thank you. BIS Review 151/2007 3 
BIS Review 150/2007 1 Hamad Al-Sayari: Economic and structural policy reforms in Saudi Arabia Speech by His Excellency Hamad Al-Sayari, Governor of the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency, at the Institute of International Finance, INC MENA Regional Economic Forum, Riyadh, 7 November 2007. *      *      * It is a great pleasure for me to welcome you at this important gathering organized by the Institute of International Finance and hosted by the National Commercial Bank. I would like to thank the organizers for inviting me to speak to this distinguished audience. I understand that for the next two days, the participants will be deliberating on the state of the global economy in general and the opportunities and challenges facing the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) economies in particular. The Gulf Cooperation Council Countries (GCC) are an important constituent of the MENA region, a marketplace that is undergoing significant transformation where the member countries are opening up their markets and significant structural policy reforms are taking place. Let me begin by providing you with an overview of the ongoing economic liberalization and structural policy reforms currently underway in the Kingdom. Since the discovery of oil in the early 1930s, the oil sector has remained the linchpin of Saudi Arabian economy. Nevertheless over the past three decades, a strategic decision was made to diversify and expand the base of our economy. Towards this goal, a series of wide ranging reforms and policies were implemented in order to improve the investment climate and to attract greater private sector participation in the economy as well as facilitating inflow of foreign direct investment into the country. In the last decade, significant progress has been made and the Kingdom has enacted and implemented forty-two new trade-related laws and regulations; nineteen of them were required for our WTO accession in 2005. The last and most important of these initiatives was the reform of the Judicial System. In addition, to stimulate economic activities and attract foreign investment, the rate of corporate taxation has been reduced from 45 percent to a flat 20 percent, and the requirements for minimum start-up capital were abolished. The negative list of investment was also revised and now allows foreign investment in vital sectors like insurance services, wholesale and retail trade, air and train transport, and communication services. The Government has set itself an objective to place Saudi Arabia amongst the world’s top ten most investor friendly economies by 2010 and, therefore, the opening up of new economic sectors to FDI is in line with the ongoing economic reforms with the aim of improving the Kingdom’s investment climate. The Kingdom’s efforts towards economic reforms in order to attract foreign investment have come to fruition. According to a recent report of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), Saudi Arabia emerged as the largest recipient of foreign direct investment (FDI) in the Arab world in 2006, attracting $18 billion in FDI, an increase of 51 percent over 2005. The global rating agencies Standards & Poors and Fitch have also raised the sovereign credit ratings of the Kingdom to A+. Also, Saudi Arabia has been upgraded according to the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Index from 38th place to 23rd place in 2007. The Government has encouraged the establishment and growth of value-added industries in areas where the Kingdom has competitive advantages, namely, cheaper energy, strategic locations and availability of raw materials. King Abdullah has recently launched four mega-economic cities in Rabigh, Hail, Al-Madinah and Jazan, which are expected to draw almost 
2 BIS Review 150/2007 SR 300 billion in investment and create more than a million jobs. It is worthy to note that these economic zones are located in the less developed cities and in areas away from the existing economically developed regions and are specifically selected to ensure that development and employment opportunities are spread around the Kingdom. An important indicator of progress made in diversifying the economy is provided by the trend in our non-oil exports. Such exports were insignificant in early eighties, but they have been rising sharply in recent years. Since 2000, they have risen continuously. The non-oil sector exports were valued at about $21 billion in 2006 and constituted almost 6.0 percent of total GDP and 13.2 percent of non-oil GDP. During 2006, the national economy continued its remarkable growth for the fourth consecutive year, especially in the non-oil sector which grew by 6.2 percent following its growth rate of 5.2 percent in 2005. The non-oil industrial sector was the fastest growing sector of the economy recording a robust growth of 10.1 percent during the preceding year. The sector has continued its robust growth during the current year. Due to higher economic growth and receipt of higher than anticipated revenues, the fiscal position of the government has improved substantially in recent years. The budget surpluses since 2003 have enabled the government to reduce its domestic debt sharply and increase its expenditure on infrastructure and social sectors. The ratio of domestic debt to GDP has declined from 82 percent in 2003 to 27.9 percent in 2006 which was reflected positively on our public finance and macroeconomic stability. These trends are likely to continue against the oil revenue cushion and fiscal discipline along with continuous expansion of the economy. The foregoing policy initiatives, combined with the recent budgetary surpluses have enabled us to launch a number of key development projects that are designed to develop the county's physical and social infrastructure, especially spending on education and training, diversifying the economy, creating jobs and enhancing growth prospects. A key facet of the economic reforms has been the active participation of the private sector in all aspects of the economy particularly in the manufacturing, construction and services sectors. Now turning to the Kingdom’s goals and aspirations for the next decades. We have a clear vision that Saudi Arabia will represent an industrial hub among the region's countries, leveraging off on its strategic location, competitive supply of energy, size of the local market, ease of access to global markets, and the growing partnerships between the public and private sectors. This strategy fulfils our State’s goal of diversifying our economic production base away from Oil. For this purpose, we have encouraged and will continue to encourage the private sector by providing attractive incentives, including the setting up of industrial zones in various parts of the country, equipping them with various infrastructural facilities and by increasing the capital base of specialized credit institutions to provide long-term loans to entrepreneurs. Nevertheless, the Saudi economy is facing a number of challenges the most important of which is the increasing rate of inflation. Although inflation was less than 1 percent on average in the last two decades, it rose to 2.2 percent in 2006 and it continued to increase during the last months, exceeding 4 percent in last August according to the Central Department of Statistics and Information. Our concern is that factors that caused accelerating inflation are still in existence. These include external ones such as higher prices of foodstuffs and commodities, and internal factors such as the remarkable rise in rents in the main cities due to the economic expansion, increasing demand for housing and offices resulting from an increase in spending on investment, and the expansion of services sector especially in the financial and construction sectors. Although the inflation rate in the Kingdome is less than that in most countries of the region due to the size of domestic production base and due to the availability of directly and indirectly subsidized goods and services such as flour, fuel, water, electricity, and some 
BIS Review 150/2007 3 foodstuffs, the continuing increase in inflation requires SAMA to keep a close watch on it and adopt all possible policies to confront this challenge. Dear audience, The banking system’s performance has continued to strengthen over the years with proactive monitoring and guidance from SAMA. Saudi banks achieved good profits, such as the average Return on Equity and average Return on assets. They have not been affected by turmoil in global markets. The banks also have average Basel Capital Adequacy Ratios of over 21 percent well above the mandated international standard of 8 percent. To ensure the continuation of this trend, we continue to accord high priority to appropriate prudential regulations and close supervision of banks. During 2005, SAMA rolled out a risk based approach to bank supervision with on site and off site risk assessments undertaken on an ongoing basis. All Saudi Banks are on target to implement all 3 Pillars of the Basle II Capital Adequacy by January 2008, using the standardized approach. During the past decade, Saudi banks have made tremendous progress in terms of offering innovative products and services, introducing sophisticated technological delivery channels including ATMs, Internet and Phone Banking. In cooperation with SAMA, banks have set up advanced payment and settlement systems, including Automated Clearing Houses and real time gross value electronic funds transfer systems such as SPAN and SARIE. The introduction of technologically advanced systems has resulted in significantly improving the level and quality of customer service, a reduction in transactional costs and increase in efficiencies and strengthening controls. Regarding the capital market, a number of measures have been taken by the Capital Market Authority to deepen and broaden the market which will enhance its role in the development of the economy. The Capital Market Authority has been issuing licenses for setting up specialized companies devoted exclusively to conducting securities business in the Kingdom. So far, it has issued 70 licenses for the purpose. Our financial system is continuing to develop and grow in strength and sophistication. The insurance sector is being reorganized under the Cooperative Insurance Law of 2003, which has entrusted SAMA with the responsibility of supervising insurance business in the country. At the time of the enactment of the Law, there was only one licensed company namely National Cooperative Company for Insurance (NCCI) operating in the country. Other companies were unlicensed. Several companies have applied, and Royal Decrees were issued approving the establishment of 21 insurance companies. Approvals were issued by SAMA for 50 offices to provide insurance related services such as brokerage, loss assessment and insurance consultations. Some offices completed necessary procedures to obtain commercial registrations and others are about to finalize necessary procedures. More licenses are expected to be issued soon. The banking system is also being expanded by allowing foreign banks to open branches in the Kingdom. So far ten licenses have been issued for that purpose to 5 GCC banks and to 5 banks from other countries. All of them have already established their branches in the Kingdom, or are likely to open their branches in the very near future. Also, in March 2006 the Council of Ministers approved the foundation of a Saudi joint-stock company under the name "Alinm'a Bank" with a capital of SR 15 billion to carry out normal banking business and investment. This bank is likely to become operational in the near future. Saudi Arabia has one of the youngest populations in the world. This means that one of the challenges facing the national economy is to continue creating jobs for our young people to enter the labour market. This involves development of education and training to qualify the youth and prepare it to meet the requirements of the labour market. This subject is being given a high priority in the State's plans which envisage expansion in the establishment of more universities, specialized colleges, training centers and encouraging the private sector to 
4 BIS Review 150/2007 contribute to the effort in that direction. Notable progress has been made in providing most government jobs to Saudis. A major achievement of the Saudi Banking system has been in areas of human resources, where banks have continued to increase the use of Saudi citizens. I am therefore pleased to note that in this regard the Banking sector is ahead of all other industrial sectors and currently a level of about 80 percent Saudization has been achieved. The employment of Saudis at senior executive level has reached 70 percent. However, one of the most important challenges currently facing the financial sector is the great increase in the need for qualified skills due to the expansion by banks in their business and establishment of financial services institutions and insurance companies and insurance related services and free professions. This will result in a great pressure on available technical skills in these fields. This has been noted recently in the high rise in the wages for such specialized skills and competition by financial institutions to attract such skills. I hope that exaggeration in this competition will not increase the rotation of the manpower in this sector in a manner that would affect work in its institutions. The next stage in the Saudization policy is to increase the proportion of Saudis in the new jobs that are being created by our expanding economy. The government has recently launched a program to support small-and-medium-size enterprises which will also create employment opportunities for Saudis. The forthcoming stage of the Saudiization policy will focus on increasing the share of Saudis in new posts created by economic growth. The Government has recently launched a programme for supporting small and medium size companies, thereby, new jobs will be available for Saudis. There are also a number of challenges in deepening and broadening the financial sector with significant implications for the economy. These include the creation of a viable and vibrant mortgage industry, which would have significant impacts on housing, construction, durable goods and other ancillary sectors. Also, there are initiatives in place to establish sound insurance and leasing industries. These initiatives are also aimed at enlarging the institutional investors' base that can channel resources in developing a pool of expertise, professional skills and technical knowledge in the financial sector. I wish to conclude with the observation that Saudi Arabia's economy is currently undergoing through a stage of accelerated growth in all sectors of the economy at a level and pace unprecedented in the past. The Government is spearheading this dynamic growth with its avowed policy of structural reforms and liberalization in the economy, as evidenced by its success in attracting the private sector and foreign direct investment into primarily the non-oil sectors of the economy. The Saudi economy is an integral part of the global economy and is thus susceptible to systemic risks, although Saudi Arabia did not feel the financial turmoil and liquidity crisis experienced by the rest of the world as a result of the recent sub-prime crisis, we are, nonetheless, vigilant in our efforts to continually monitor the domestic market and to ensure continuation and stability of policies and regulations. I wish all success to your forum and a good stay in the Kingdom. Thank you for your attention. 
Philipp Hildebrand: The challenge of sovereign wealth funds  Speech by Mr Philipp Hildebrand, Vice-Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the International Center for Monetary and Banking Studies, Geneva, 18 December 2007. I would like to thank Signe Krogstrup for her valuable support in drafting this speech. I also want to thank Rita Kobel, Urs W. Birchler, Daniel Heller and Bertrand Rime for helpful comments and discussions. *      *      * 1.  Introduction I am very pleased to be in Geneva. The International Center for Monetary and Banking Studies (ICMB) provides a wonderful platform to discuss a wide range of economic and monetary policy challenges. On behalf of my ICMB Foundation Board colleagues, I would like to thank Charles Wyplosz for his successful and long-standing stewardship of the ICMB. Tonight, I want to talk about Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs). Broadly defined, SWFs are government-owned investment corporations. For the most part, they invest their funds in foreign currency assets. SWFs are usually managed separately from central bank reserves. Unlike other publicly owned pools of capital, such as social security funds or public pension funds, SWFs have no explicit liabilities. As you can see in slide 1, the estimated assets currently managed by SWFs exceed the combined pool of assets managed by hedge funds and private equity firms. Total assets held by SWFs remain small, however, in comparison to the combined assets managed by pension funds and mutual funds worldwide. The rise in SWFs is closely linked to the global macroeconomic imbalances that have characterized the world economy since the mid 1990s. Since these imbalances are unlikely to unwind in the near term, SWFs are likely to keep growing disproportionably for some time.  The rapid rise of SWFs has undoubtedly brought a number of benefits. One of them has recently become particularly evident. Against the backdrop of the current market turmoil, SWFs have been a welcome source of capital, strengthening the vulnerable balance sheets of some of the world’s largest financial institutions. I will return to this important point at the end of my lecture. But the investments made by SWFs have also given rise to considerable political controversy and media coverage. Slide 2 provides a sample of some of the most pertinent recent headlines. The political controversy does not derive from the fact that SWFs are new. They are not. Political leaders are anxious because the rapid rise of SWFs and their increasing visibility as large investors in mature markets challenge some long-held assumptions about how the global economy works. In the process, the investment decisions of SWFs run the risk of triggering defensive reactions in mature countries. If left unchecked, this process could feed financial protectionism, which would clearly be to the detriment of global economic welfare. To provide some context, I will first describe the rise of SWFs. I will then discuss in more detail what I view to be the primary challenge arising from SWFs. Finally, I will briefly touch upon a number of recent policy proposals. On the basis of these ideas, and drawing on the history of central banking, I will then offer some personal reflections on what a simple but effective policy response might look like. In closing, I will briefly comment on the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC), one of the most prominent SWFs in the world. As you know, UBS last week turned to the GIC for a substantial capital injection in connection with losses in the sub-prime credit markets.  BIS Review 150/2007 1 
2.  The rise in sovereign wealth funds  I noted at the outset that the rapid growth in SWFs is largely a by-product of global macroeconomic imbalances. Slide 3 shows that the current account deficit of the US has increased every year since 1992. The deficit surpassed USD 800 billion, or 6 percent of GDP, in 2006. Such a large current account deficit is unprecedented in US history.1 This rise in the US current account deficit has been mirrored almost one to one in the combined rise of surpluses in South East Asian countries and oil exporting countries. I will refer to these two country groupings as the surplus regions. By definition, the surplus regions are investing less than they are saving, and hence, both regions are accumulating net financial claims on foreigners. But the underlying reasons for the current account surpluses in the two regions are distinct. The South East Asian countries saw an increase in savings and a fall in investment in the wake of the Asian financial crisis.2 Since then, these countries have generally continued to pursue a macroeconomic policy mix in support of an export-led growth strategy which sustains these savings-investment patterns. Meanwhile, in the oil exporting countries, export revenues have been boosted by the increase in the price of oil since 2000. You can see this in slide 4. Since domestic investments in these countries have not increased at the same pace, the result has been a rise in net savings in the oil exporting countries. The two surplus regions have one thing in common. In both cases, foreign assets are accumulated almost entirely by the official sector. In the oil exporting countries, oil revenues primarily accrue to governments. Higher oil revenues therefore translate into higher government budget surpluses. In South East Asia, where the currencies shadow the dollar, foreign assets are accumulated primarily by the central banks in the form of official foreign exchange reserve accumulation. Slide 5 shows that the global macroeconomic imbalances have led to a rapid accumulation of global official foreign exchange reserves.3 Let me now leave you with five stylized facts about SWFs.  First, as I already pointed out, SWFs are not a new phenomenon. With its Caisse des Dépots et Consignations, France set up a SWF in 1816.4 Slide 6 shows the year of establishment of each of the 14 largest SWFs currently in operation. The Kuwait Investment Authority was established in 1953. Since then, SWFs have been set up essentially in two waves. The first one occurred in the second half of the 1970s. The second wave began in 1996 with the setting up of Norway’s Government Pension Fund – Global. The steep increase in oil prices since 2000, the widening of global imbalances and the resulting accumulation of foreign exchange reserves suggest that other countries will follow suit. By applying a simple rule to identify which countries potentially hold excess reserves, we can readily identify the countries that are obvious candidates for future SWFs. Slide 7 shows a list of countries that meet the following two conditions.5 They have no SWF at present and, judging by the Greenspan-Guidotti rule, they hold excess reserves of at least USD ten billion.6                                                   1  Note that according to SNB staff calculations, the US current account deficit currently absorbs about 60 percent of the world's aggregate current account surpluses. The remaining deficits are located largely in a handful of EU countries (Spain, Italy, Greece, France and the UK, 30 percent), in Central and Eastern Europe (8 percent). The final 2 percent originate in developing countries. 2  The exception is China, which has attracted even more investments since the Asian crisis, while savings have also increased faster. See, for example, Genberg et. al. (2005). 3  In some countries, the reserve accumulation has been further magnified by private capital inflows. 4 I am grateful to Benoit Coeuré of the French Treasury for this comment (see Coeuré, 2007). 5  Summers (2007) has a similar table which also includes countries that already have SWFs. 6  The Greenspan-Guidotti rule is based on the definition of a sufficient level of reserves as equal to the level of short-term foreign currency debt of the country. Excess reserves are calculated as reserves in excess of this level. 2 BIS Review 150/2007 
Second, in terms of size, SWFs have become important financial market participants. The 14 largest SWFs are estimated to have approximately USD 2.2 trillion under management.7 Some market estimates put combined assets as high as 3.5 trillion dollars.8 The estimated combined assets of the world's 14 largest SWFs now constitute nearly half the size of the world’s total official foreign exchange reserves.9 As I pointed out at the beginning, however, the assets of the world’s SWFs are still much smaller than the assets invested in mutual funds (USD 19.3 trillion) or global pension funds (USD 21.6 trillion).10Third, SWFs are likely to grow substantially in coming years. Market forecasts, which assume that high oil prices and the large current account surpluses in South East Asia will persist, project that SWFs will increase three to fivefold in nominal dollar terms over the next five to ten years.11 My own view is that such simplistic linear forecasts will likely prove to have been flawed. Nonetheless, it is difficult to argue with the basic direction of these forecasts. The fundamental dynamic behind the recent rise of SWFs will not disappear over night. As I mentioned, estimated excess reserves are very large.12 In all likelihood, at least some of these excess reserves will be transferred to SWFs in coming years. Moreover, even if global imbalances were to unwind quickly, for instance in association with a sharp and protracted recession in the United States, the power of compound return will continue to be a substantial source of growth for SWFs that already exist.  Fourth, SWFs have so far been initiated predominantly in the Middle East and in Asia. Slide 8 shows that these two regions account for 77 percent of the assets of the largest SWFs. Nonetheless, we should not lose sight of the fact that 16 percent of the assets of the 14 largest SWFs are held in developed countries.13Fifth, SWFs will increasingly attempt to diversify their holdings. They will do so gradually, given the prevailing size and liquidity constraints. Like central banks, SWFs have traditionally been investors in highly rated fixed income assets. Going forward, SWFs will increasingly look for investments in equity markets, both public and private ones. Several of these investments have recently produced headlines in the global financial press. Slide 9 depicts some of them.  3.  The challenges In my introductory comments, I suggested that much of the anxiety surrounding SWFs stems from the fact that their increasing presence in mature markets presents a challenge to some long-held assumptions about how the global economy works. Let me elaborate a little bit on three such assumptions. As you will see, they are very much interlinked.                                                   7  This is shown in table 1 in the appendix. Sources: Truman (2007a, 2007b), IMF, Morgan Stanley, FT. 8  Morgan Stanley, Standard Chartered, Deutsche Bank and Merrill Lynch all recently produced estimates, ranging from USD 2.5 to 3.5 trillion. 9  Global reserves amounted to USD 4.7 trillion in the second quarter of 2007, according to IMF's COFER database. 10  2006 estimate by Mckinsey Global Institute. The size of pension fund assets held by OECD countries is estimated at USD 13.2 trillion by the OECD. 11  The estimates of Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley and Standard Chartered are, respectively, that SWFs will grow to USD 7.9 trillion by 2011, USD 9 trillion by 2015, USD 12 trillion in 2015 and USD 13.40 trillion by 2017. 12  According to SNB calculations, excess reserves of developing countries according to the Greenspan-Guidotti rule reached USD 2.5 trillion in the second quarter of 2007.  13  These are located in the US (Alaska Permanent Reserve Fund), Australia and Norway. BIS Review 150/2007 3 
First, since the early 1980s, we have witnessed broad-based and sustained political momentum to deregulate and liberalise economic structures, enhance the role of market forces and attempt to reduce the role of governments in the global economy. Looking back, Ronald Reagan’s confrontation with the air traffic controllers union in 1981 marks the beginning of this process. Most of you in this room would probably concur with the premise that the secular trend to strengthen the role of free markets and competition as the overarching organising principles of the global economy has contributed significantly to the long period of prosperity that the world economy has enjoyed. In this context, SWFs represent a potential threat. Sizeable state-sponsored foreign investments in mature economies can be perceived to be a threat to free market forces.14 Moreover, such investments run the risk of triggering protectionist reactions in the recipient countries. Second, one of the basic premises of open global capital markets is the idea that capital flows freely worldwide in search of investment opportunities that yield optimal risk-adjusted rates of return. The fact that large and government-controlled investment companies make substantial investments in privately owned companies in other countries raises concerns about the validity of the hypothesis that capital seeks optimal risk-adjusted rates of returns. Governments of recipient countries may have doubts about the motivation behind such investments. Are SWFs in pursuit of a variant of the traditional motive to maximise returns? Or could a particular government be tempted to use its SWF as a financial instrument in pursuit of a particular political objective? The mere fact that such questions arise could serve as a trigger for protectionist policies in recipient countries, thus again undermining the proper functioning of free markets. Third, as a general rule, capital has historically tended to flow from the core of an economic system to its periphery.15 Most recently, global capital flows from the periphery to the core are clearly on the rise. SWFs play a potentially important role in what appears to be a reversal of global capital flows. The economics students here will recognise that this apparent reversal in capital flows is not really a new phenomenon, but a new and unexpected variant of the Lucas Paradox which Bob Lucas described in a seminal paper in 1990.16 Nonetheless, the sense that capital increasingly flows from the periphery to the core is raising a variety of political sensitivities in the core countries. I fear that many of these sensitivities will likely be protectionist in nature. As you can see, in all three cases, the real or perceived activities of SWFs play a role in challenging these deeply held assumptions about the world economy. In my view, the most important challenge associated with the rise of SWFs is therefore to ensure that the policy reactions in the recipient countries of potential and actual SWF investments do not degenerate into what ultimately amounts to financial protectionism.  Let me simply mention that there are other potential challenges associated with SWFs, such as concerns that SWFs could pose a risk to financial stability.17 A related concern is that asset allocation changes by some of the larger SWFs could result in disorderly market price adjustments.18 While it is impossible to rule out such effects, these risks are clearly not unique to SWFs. Moreover, they strike me as being second-order problems, compared to the threat of the activities of SWFs unleashing a vicious cycle of financial protectionism.                                                   14  SEC Chairman Christopher Cox, for example, points out possible conflicts of interest arising from foreign government ownership of businesses (Cox 2007).  15  Bernanke (2006) also points out that capital as a general rule has historically been flowing from core to periphery. See, for example, Jones and Obstfeld (2000) and Obstfeld and Taylor (2003) for historical evidence. 16  Lucas (1990). 17  See, for example, Lowery (2007) and Johnson (2007). 18  See for example IMF (2007). 4 BIS Review 150/2007 
4.  Policy response Let me now turn to the question of how to respond to the risks associated with SWFs. As I said in my introduction, I would like to provide you with my own judgment on what kind of policy response will likely be required to address adequately the risks I have tried to outline. But before I do so, let me briefly touch upon four policy ideas that are currently being circulated.  First, a number of European politicians are calling for increased transparency requirements relating to actual portfolio positions of SWFs.19 A more far-reaching development are the calls for legislation that would block SWFs from taking major stakes in companies in any strategic sectors.20  Second, a number of politicians have proposed the principle of reciprocity as a guiding principle for granting market access to SWFs.21 For example, Jean-Claude Juncker, the Luxembourg Prime Minister and Euro-group president, has stated, "Countries that protect their own markets cannot expect to be allowed to make unimpeded investments in Europe."22 In a strict sense, the principle of reciprocity means that SWFs are only allowed to invest in a foreign country if companies in that country are allowed to invest freely in the home country of the SWF. Since many SWFs are located in countries which are financially less open than a typical OECD country, a strict application of the reciprocity principle would place strong limitations on SWF investments.  Third, Larry Summers has suggested that if SWFs were to invest through intermediary asset managers, most risks associated with SWFs would be mitigated, if not avoided.23 Incidentally, Summers argues that the added benefit of such an indirect investment philosophy is that it generates a better risk-return profile.  Fourth, there is now considerable political momentum behind the idea of a code of conduct or a set of guidelines for SWFs. The idea that is emerging is that SWFs would adopt such a code on a voluntary basis in an attempt to alleviate concerns in the most important mature market. At the October 2007 IMF/World Bank Annual meetings in Washington, the finance ministers and central bankers of the G7 countries discussed the issue in a private meeting with a number of leading SWFs. They subsequently stated that they “see merit in identifying best practices for sovereign wealth funds in such areas as institutional structure, risk management, transparency and accountability.”24 Since then, G7 treasury officials have continued to engage with a number of leading SWFs. The US has called on the International Monetary Fund to try to identify possible best practices, noting that these should be modeled on best practices for managing international reserves.25 So far, Ted Truman has developed                                                  19 For example, Joaquín Almunia, the EU Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs summarised the general position of the European Commission as calling on SWFs operating in EU member countries to increase the transparency of their operations and investments. Interview with the Financial Times on 28 September 2007. 20  In Germany, legislation has been drafted that would enable the German government to veto any foreign investors intending to take a stake of 25% or more in a German company that may threaten national security; Süddeutsche Zeitung, 30 September 2007. 21  Reciprocity has also been raised by Alistair Darling in response to SWFs, see, for example, "Chancellor backs G7 move to get tough on sovereign wealth funds", The Guardian, 20 October 2007. 22  Germany's Handelsblatt newspaper, 19 October 2007. 23  Larry Summers on SWFs, Financial Times, 30 June 2007. See also Summers (2006). 24 Statement by G-7 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors, Washington, DC. (http://www.mof.go.jp/english/if/g7_071019.pdf) 25  The US policy stance has been relayed to the public by US Undersecretary for International Affairs, David H. McCormick, in testimony before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs on 14 BIS Review 150/2007 5 
the most extensive set of proposals for best practices for SWFs.26 He calls it a “standard to guide the activities of SWFs". The standard sets out norms for transparency and accountability with respect to four different aspects. They are: objectives and investment strategy, governance, actual investment portfolios and fund management behaviour.  The effort by the authorities of the largest industrialised countries and the leading SWFs to develop jointly a set of “good governance guidelines” is timely and clearly sensible. There is a risk, however, that these efforts will fail, or will prove to be counterproductive if the demands from the industrialised countries are too ambitious, or if such guidelines are ultimately motivated by the desire in mature markets to impose veiled barriers to foreign investments.  In my view, a future code of conduct or a set of guidelines must cover two central issues if they are to be effective. First, to quell the concerns of recipient countries with respect to politically motivated investments, a code of conduct must contain governance prescriptions that ensure that the investment decisions of SWFs are not driven by political objectives. I believe the institutional design of modern central banking can offer some clues as to the appropriate form of these governance prescriptions. Central banks and SWFs obviously pursue fundamentally different objectives. But, in principle, they are both at risk of being hijacked by governments for political aims. In the case of central banks, this problem has been successfully addressed by the adoption of an institutional design based on two powerful features. Central banks have a clear mandate, typically focused on or around price stability. Moreover, they have generally been given statutory independence from governments in pursuing their mandate. This simple institutional design has become best practice and has made an important contribution to keeping politics largely out of monetary policy. Second, to preclude a resurgence of state ownership in our economies, SWF guidelines need to spell out upper limits to investment stakes in foreign private companies. It is difficult to determine what such limits should be. As I alluded earlier, it is not just a matter of pre-empting majority stakes of SWFs in foreign companies. “Cross-border nationalisation” of private companies is simply the most extreme version of a broader unwelcome trend.27 For this reason, I believe that to alleviate fears about excessive meddling of governments in private companies, a SWF code of conduct will have to set the limit for individual stakes at a level significantly below the typical threshold of a controlling minority, let alone an absolute majority.  As long as a recipient country can be confident that a particular SWF operates in accordance with these two paramount guidelines, there is no reason to demand intricate levels of portfolio transparency from SWFs. Transparency is an attractive answer to intractable problems. But it is unlikely to solve the problems I have tried to outline here. Indeed, I fear that, in some cases, extensive transparency requirements for SWF portfolios could actually end up triggering protectionist reactions in mature markets. It is also important to remember that most stock exchanges already impose various disclosure requirements for large equity holdings in listed companies. There are, of course, a host of reasons why SWFs should, over time, become more transparent. Many of these reasons have to do with the presumed desire of the citizens of a SWF country to demand accountability. Once again, the history of central banking may provide some valuable insights here. The more independent central banks have become, the                                                                                                                                                       November, 2007. McCormick moreover stressed that the US remains open and welcoming to investment from Sovereign Wealth Funds. 26  Truman (2007a). 27  As far as I know, Larry Summers has coined this term. 6 BIS Review 150/2007 
more they have recognised their obligation to be accountable to the public. Typically, more accountability has meant more transparency. An independent central bank is therefore likely to be transparent about how it pursues its mandate. The same may turn out to be true for SWFs.  There are a number of difficult questions that need to be addressed before a set of SWF guidelines can become operational. What exactly do we mean by a non-political investment mandate? How do we gauge to what extent there might or might not be political interference in the pursuit of such a mandate? Will there be a need for a referee to determine whether a SWF complies with a particular set of guidelines? What happens if a SWF initially signs up to a code of conduct but subsequently fails to comply with its guidelines? As you can see, much work remains to be done and the timeframe is tight. Ideally, a first set of guidelines will be agreed upon jointly between the G7 countries and the most prominent SWFs by the 2008 spring meetings of the IMF and the World Bank. If well designed and agreed upon, such a set of guidelines could serve as a basis for determining which SWFs will continue to enjoy full market access in mature economies.  5.  Conclusion Before I conclude, let me say a few words about the capital participation of the GIC in UBS that was recently announced. As you know, the GIC recently committed to subscribe to CHF 11 billion of a mandatory convertible bond which will be issued by UBS in an effort to raise capital in the aftermath of losses on large sub-prime mortgage positions. Subject to the UBS shareholders’ approval, the GIC will in due time become a significant shareholder in UBS. In the process, UBS will significantly strengthen its balance sheet and thereby maintain a substantial capital cushion relative to the regulatory minimum. A strengthened capital cushion is to be welcomed. First and foremost, it serves as a confidence-building measure. Moreover, in uncertain times, a solid capital cushion provides insurance against a further potential deterioration in the global macroeconomic environment.  Who is this new Asian investor in the largest Swiss bank? The GIC was set up in May 1981 with an original seed capital of several billion dollars from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).28 The central bank reserves had grown steadily throughout the 1970s as a result of public sector surpluses. The GIC’s objective was to invest the portion of foreign reserves, which was surplus to the needs of the central bank for its monetary policy management, in longer-term assets. The mandate of the GIC is to preserve at a minimum the international purchasing power of its assets against inflation and global exchange rate risk. The objective of the GIC is commercial, focusing on long-term investment returns. In many ways, it is similar to the objectives of the large European public pension funds. In fact, the GIC has exceeded that mandate and has generated an average return of 9.5 per cent in US dollar terms since inception. The size of the assets managed by the GIC is not publicly known. The GIC has stated that it manages more than USD 100 billion but some estimates have put their assets under management at over USD 300 billion. The assets of the GIC are invested in ten asset classes – developed market public equities, emerging market public equities, private equity, infrastructure, nominal bonds, inflation-linked bonds, real estate, commodities, hedge funds and short-term assets including currency overlay. Geographically, its investments are concentrated in the US, Europe and Japan, but span almost 50 countries.  Based on what is known about the GIC, and judging by the reasoning I have outlined in my lecture this evening, there is little cause for concern about the UBS equity stake the GIC will likely acquire. Over the past quarter century, the GIC has gained a solid reputation as a                                                  28  The original idea of setting up a dedicated government investment institution separate from the MAS was conceived by the then Deputy Prime Minister Dr Goh Keng Swee and endorsed by the then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, who continues to serve as the GIC’s Chairman of the Board.

global investor. With regard to the specific topic of my lecture this evening, I expect the GIC to demonstrate leadership in the coming months to help shape an agreement with the governments of the most important mature countries on a set of guidelines for SWFs that will hopefully help to address the challenges I discussed this evening.  To summarise, SWFs have become an important source of capital flowing from the periphery to the core of today’s global economy. As such, they can play a constructive role in mature markets. At the same time, SWFs pose a challenge to the international community. The challenge is to preclude an outcome where the activities of SWFs trigger policy responses in mature markets that ultimately lead us down the path of financial protectionism. It is in the interest of mature markets and developing countries alike to avoid such an outcome. A set of guidelines addressing the threat of politically driven investment decisions and resurging state involvement in the global economy represent the best currently available option to respond to the challenge of SWFs. Let me close with a broader Swiss perspective. Switzerland has in absolute terms the sixth largest current account surplus in the world. Last year, foreign investments by Swiss companies and Swiss individuals generated net income receipts equivalent to 12 per cent of our GDP, or approximately CHF 60 billion. In other words, we are experts at making profitable cross-border investments. This means that we have as strong an incentive as virtually any country in keeping global financial markets open.

Thomas Jordan: Real estate prices falling in the US, rising in Switzerland – implications for the SNB’s monetary policy Summary of a speech by Mr Thomas Jordan, Member of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the Hochschule für Technik und Wirtschaft, Chur, 18 December 2007. The complete speech can be found in German on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). *      *      * Developments in the real estate market are important for monetary policy. Real estate markets can influence inflation and economic cycles, but also the stability of the financial system. Property bubbles can result in a massive misdirection of capital and thus give rise to lengthy and difficult adjustment processes. Therefore, the SNB closely monitors developments on the real estate markets both in Switzerland and abroad. The economic outlook is still clouded by undesirable developments on the US real estate market, notably in the period 2004-2006. Given the size of the United States and the broad international spread of investments in the US mortgage market, these distortions have had a serious impact on the world’s financial markets and on global economic development. For some years now, Switzerland too has been experiencing a construction boom and a relatively sharp rise in property prices in certain regions and in given market segments. Comparison of the Swiss and US real estate markets shows, however, that these markets differ in a number of key respects. In particular, stricter discipline is observed in Switzerland in terms of compliance with credit conditions, and price swings have been considerably less extreme. Moreover, there is no evidence to date of any upsurge in speculative trends on the Swiss property market. At present, neither a general property bubble nor any general mortgage problem could probably be said to exist. Although the banks have largely drawn the correct conclusions from the real estate crisis of the 1990s with regard to lending in Switzerland, it is still essential – given the losses on the US real estate market – to carefully assess risks when granting loans (including mortgages) in Switzerland too.

Jean-Pierre Roth: Recent economic and financial developments in Switzerland  Introductory remarks by Mr Jean-Pierre Roth, Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank for International Settlements, at the end-of-year media news conference, Zurich, 13 December 2007. *      *      * Economic outlook The last few months have seen a number of remarkable events in the global economy. The US dollar has plunged, dropping below the level attained in 1995 against the Swiss franc. Oil prices have continued to soar, threatening to breach the hundred dollar mark. Sub-prime credit markets continue to disrupt financial markets. How have these factors affected the international economy? The US economy is affected simultaneously by the unfavourable developments in real estate markets, which are impacting on credit markets, and by increasing oil prices. At the same time, the fall in the dollar is bolstering external demand, so that most observers are not forecasting more than a temporary decline in US economic growth next year. As for the European economy – which is less open than the national economies of which it is composed – it is only slightly affected at present by the upturn in the euro, mirroring the downturn in the US dollar. The outlook for European growth in 2008 remains favourable, despite a light downward correction. All in all, the international economic situation remains generally positive, although it is true to say that this assessment is even more uncertain than three months ago. Despite its substantial international integration, the Swiss economy, at this point, is scarcely affected by the turmoil in the international financial markets. Growth remained strong in the third quarter. Real gross domestic product rose at an annual rate of 3.3%. Employment continued improving across the board, in line with our expectations. In both the industrial and service sectors, the process of new job creation carried on. In construction, employment stabilised at a high level. Unemployment continued falling. As a result of the favourable developments in the labour market, consumer sentiment remains buoyant. Consequently, household expenditure is still increasing at a robust pace. Furthermore, strong demand for labour is now leading to a faster increase in real wages. Given this situation, private consumption should continue to support growth in 2008. Due to impetus from Europe, Asia and the oil-producing countries, goods exports are advancing further. Looking at production, expectations remain optimistic both for the manufacturing sector and for non-financial services – businesses expect the growth phase to persist. Investment activity remains lively.  The banking sector is faced with the uncertainties that have arisen out of the developments in the US real estate market together with the structured products that relate to this market. It is possible that the contribution of the Swiss financial sector to GDP growth will fall as early as the fourth quarter of this year, due to a drop in the volume of activity on financial markets. Other factors could also have an impact during the course of 2008, for instance, via a decline in the total wage bill paid by the sector.  Against this backdrop, Swiss GDP growth is likely to settle at around 2% in 2008. This easing-off should allow for a reduction in the level of capacity utilisation. In a moment I will outline the risks attached to our baseline scenario. BIS Review 150/2007 1 
Developments in monetary and financial conditions Since the onset of the sub-prime credit crisis in August, yields on long-term Swiss Confederation bonds have remained almost unchanged. For 10-year maturities, the rate has fluctuated around 3%. For shorter maturity bonds, however, the search for quality investments has resulted in a drop in rates. Yields on two-year maturities, for instance, have fallen from 3.0% to 2.0%. However, this decline has been partly offset or even fully neutralised by an increase in risk premiums, in particular in the case of issuers with poor ratings. Since September, the depreciation in the US dollar has accelerated. The Swiss franc has also strengthened a little against the euro, although the movements were more volatile in nature.  Monetary and financial conditions can also be analysed in terms of volumes. Special attention should be given to commercial lending, since a shortage of credit in the current circumstances would be equivalent to a tightening in monetary conditions. However, no effect of this kind can be identified in Switzerland, not even in the most recent statistics. On the contrary, trends that have been observed over a period of several years continue to hold. The gradual slowdown in the growth of mortgage loans, whose rate of increase is now below 4%, is persisting. The growth in other lending is still picking up pace, confirming the momentum of the business cycle. These loans are now growing at a rate of 16%, which is faster than in the boom period of 1999 and 2000. At this rate, the level attained during that previous boom will soon be reached again. The behaviour of the monetary aggregates might appear to contradict movements in lending. However, we should not forget that money is a long-term indicator, while the other credits are an indicator that moves in line with the business cycle. In response to past increases in interest rates, a transfer from sight deposits and savings deposits to higher-yield term deposits is underway. Consequently, the M1 and M2 monetary aggregates, which do not include term deposits, are declining. M3, which incorporates all types of deposits, is registering very moderate growth compatible with more stable inflation in the medium and long term.  Risks associated with the inflation outlook As usual, our assessment of the inflation outlook is embedded in the baseline scenario that we consider the most probable future development. However, the uncertainties associated with the scenario are greater than usual. This is due to a convergence of various trends with differing effects on the economy.    First of all, there are a number of events that could slow down the economy, thereby moderating inflation. A deterioration in the international growth outlook associated with a widening of the impact of the crisis in the US real estate market should be placed in this first category. If the resulting slowdown in the growth of the Swiss economy remains moderate, this would reinforce price stability. However, a substantial slowdown would necessitate a change of direction for us. Next, there are some developments that could simultaneously slow the economy and threaten price stability. An example of this, if it were to prove persistent, is the rise in oil prices. In this respect, monetary policy finds itself in a dilemma and care needs to be taken in order to prevent prices from spiralling out of control.  Finally, there are developments that could stimulate economic activity – which is already at a high level – as well as exacerbating inflationary risks. In this category we should mention a possible continued weakening in the Swiss franc. To date, the depreciation of the currency has mainly stimulated the economy without pushing up prices. Negative effects on inflation have been limited due to productivity gains, the opening up of the labour market and the appearance of new international competitors. 2 BIS Review 150/2007 
The concurrence of these contradictory risk factors makes a global evaluation difficult and encourages the adoption of a prudent and watchful attitude. Monetary policy decision We have decided to leave the current Libor target range unchanged and to continue aiming for the middle of the range. This decision is based on the following considerations. Our analyses show that, following the slowdown in the global economy, the outlook for inflation has improved, if we disregard the temporary rise that will occur over the next few months as a result of the rise in oil prices. Moreover, the turmoil affecting the international financial markets and the uncertainty with respect to the extent of possible fall-out on the rest of the economy all call for prudence. The risk of a rise in inflation has not been dispelled; of that there can be no doubt, given the rise in oil prices, the weakness of the Swiss franc against the euro, and the high level of capacity utilisation. Nevertheless, we do not consider this to be a matter of urgency and view an adjustment in our policy as unnecessary under the current circumstances. It is evident that we will continue to keep a very close watch on developments in the situation.  Inflation forecast graph I will now turn to the final part of my remarks. What is our inflation forecast? The dashed red curve on the graph represents the new forecast. It relates to the period between the fourth quarter of 2007 and the third quarter of 2010, and maps the future development of inflation on the assumption that the 2.75% level remains constant over the forecasting period. For purposes of comparison, the dash-dotted green curve shows the inflation forecast of the September monetary assessment, which was also based on a three-month Libor of 2.75%.   The new forecast indicates that inflation will rise in the first half of 2008. It is likely that it will breach even the 2% level. However, this increase will be temporary and will be chiefly due to the rise in oil prices. After that time, inflation will settle at around 1.5%, with a slight upward trend at the end of the period. The slowdown in the international economy explains the downward revision in the inflation outlook for 2009 and 2010. Naturally, any forecast is uncertain, and at present both upside and downside risks are greater than usual. Consequently, we will continue to keep a close watch on developments in the financial markets, the international economy, oil prices and the Swiss franc exchange rate, in order to assess their impact on the inflation outlook and to be in a position to react swiftly should the need arise.

Vittorio Corbo: Farewell speech as Governor of the Central Bank of Chile Speech by Mr Vittorio Corbo, Governor of the Central Bank of Chile, on his departure from the Central Bank of Chile, Santiago, 6 December 2007. *      *      * Everything comes to an end.  Today I complete my term as the Governor of the Central Bank of Chile, a post for which I was appointed on May 1st 2003 by the then President of the Republic, Mr. Ricardo Lagos. I want, first of all, to especially greet José de Gregorio, the new Governor of the Central Bank of Chile, who I am sure will lead this beloved institution through the roads of professionalism, independence and strength it requires for the good of the country and all Chileans. This is a very propitious opportunity to wish him great success in this great task. From the Board and as Vice-Governor, José has been a very relevant factor in the advances and accomplishments that our institution has made in the past several years.  In his new position, he will be backed by a first-class Board and staff of high technical and professional level, capable of assuming with rigor and efficiency the Bank’s mission. I also want to acknowledge my fellow Board members who accompanied me during this period. Being it a collegiate entity, nothing would have been achieved without their active cooperation. And I want to greet Sebastián Claro, the new Board member of the Bank, who I am sure will quickly be immersed in the spirit prevailing in this institution. I believe that everyone here today share a legitimate pride because of the place this Bank has achieved both in the Chilean society and at the world level.  Let me tell you what happened to me four years and seven months ago, when President Lagos asked me if it would be a problem to me to be appointed Board member and Governor of the Central Bank for such limited period, which was the remaining of the term of my predecessor, Mr. Carlos Massad. I replied that it was not a problem, because it gave me time enough to propose and develop an agenda.  It is no secret that I came to an institution that was living a crisis. My predecessor, in an act of great integrity, had chosen to resign in order to avoid the criticism that was building up against the Bank from affecting its institutional capital irreparably. I was aware then that, by accepting the post, I was assuming an enormous responsibility, which consisted essentially in protecting and strengthening its institutional capital. It was, therefore, a major task, that started precisely by introducing policies of risk-management, transparency and efficiency that would protect the Bank’s institutionality and autonomy. In global terms, it was tantamount to placing the Central Bank at the same level in management as it was in monetary and financial policy matters. I can say with satisfaction that it has been materialized during my period and it is also largely stated in our strategic plan for the period 2006-2008. We then proposed to implement a risk-management culture, strengthening the work of our Comptroller department to operate by international standards in matters of internal control, risk management and corporate governance. We gave it tools that grant increased autonomy and efficiency. Today the Board receives also specialized advisory on the matter, through an independent audit and compliance committee, made up by highly qualified members. All of this has helped to improve our accountability and safeguard our autonomy. BIS Review 149/2007 1 
In addition, to strengthen the Bank’s autonomy, this process had to come hand in hand with necessary advancements in access to information, in matter of transparency and in communications, both internal and external. I can say today, on the day that I leave, that I feel satisfied with our advances in internal management, of administrative, human resources and risk-management aspects, all under the framework granted us by our Constitutional Organic Law that sets clearly defined objectives and corporate governance. I sincerely thank the Bank’s staff that took in these changes with responsibility and understanding and made them their own. The Central Bank of Chile supports its stronghold in the institution’s credibility and reputation. This can only be built with the rigorous and careful work of all the people that work in it. For this reason, parallel to decisions adopted with respect to internal management and the promotion of a risk-awareness culture, we continued to work on strengths already present in key areas of the Bank, namely the Research, Financial Policy and Financial Operations Division. In this sense, it is good to recall the whole process of reorganization introduced by the Board to improve the Bank’s efficiency, taking advantage of economies of scope and reducing transaction costs. Our policy of transparency and diffusion crystallized in the creation of a Department of Communications, that later evolved into a Department of Institutional Affairs and a Department of Communications Advise, with the purpose of providing an organized structure to all the information that stems from the Central Bank of Chile and that is intended to emphasize equity and depth in the delivery of information, as well as to give the Chilean people a boost in their knowledge of economic matters. Regarding internal management, we have perfected a human resources selection mechanism through external head hunting firms for managerial posts, and open, informed contests published on the website for other job positions. We have made great progress in our job appraisal policies, compensation structures to every employee and the setting of clear, measurable goals for levels 7 and up of the organizational chart. Along the same lines, we have recently approved new labor policies oriented at integral development, in order to contribute to the institution’s increased efficiency in achieving its goals and the personal fulfillment of the people who work in the institution. We have also advanced in a technological leveling project and we have implemented three-year periods for strategic planning. I am also proud to have presided over the Central Bank during a period where the average annual inflation rate was 2.8%, and was most of the time within the established tolerance range and where the functioning of internal and external payments was totally normal. These are the objectives set forth by our Constitutional Organic Law. Unfortunately, the unusual increases in the prices of foods and energy pushed annual inflation above 7% toward this year’s end. This should be a transitory rise in inflation that will fade away in coming quarters, conditional to annual inflation expectations remain anchored around 3%.  It is not pleasant to leave the Central Bank with such a high inflation figure. But I understand that it is a circumstantial development that is part of the job, and that the highly qualified Board and staff will take the appropriate decisions to achieve the objective to return inflation to 3% within the habitual policy horizon.  We have applied an effective monetary policy that has become a powerful countercyclical tool, in light of the experience of recent years. But it would be of little use if we did not rely on the responsible fiscal policy that Chile has applied. 2 BIS Review 149/2007 
During my term, I was lucky to work with two top-level finance ministers, with whom I always had very fluent communication in the subjects of common concern. Both of them understood, among other issues, the importance of capitalizing the Central Bank to strengthen its equity situation, an agreement that was finalized with the special support by Finance Minister Andrés Velasco, whereby the Bank would be capitalized at a pace of half a percentage point of GDP per year over a period of five years. I was able to maintain the best institutional relationship with Congress. During my administration I had the chance to work with four Senate presidents – senators Andrés Zaldívar, Hernán Larraín, Sergio Romero and Eduardo Frei Ruiz Tagle – and with presidents of the Finance Commission Alejandro Foxley, Carlos Ominami and Camilo Escalona. Our relationship was always cordial and with strict observance of the provisions set forth in our Constitutional Organic legislation. Today we must all feel proud of the place that the Central Bank of Chile now occupies in the international scene. Several measurements rank us today among the best evaluated institutions among central banks around the world in various aspects of our day-to-day operation. This is the fruit of a serious and very patient work that requires dedication and effort. I have also the satisfaction of having helped to complete the process of entry of the Central Bank of Chile as a member of the BIS (the Bank for International Settlements), and of having led a campaign to have smaller countries and those admitted in September 2003 participate in its bimonthly meetings on the global economy. This campaign succeeded thanks to the support of Jean Claude Trichet, Cristián Noyer, Tim Geithner and especially Jean-Pierre Roth. As a result of this campaign, aside from Chile, countries like Norway, Denmark, Greece, Finland, Israel and New Zealand were able to also integrate the discussion on the global economy. Those meetings gather central bank governors of the main economies of the world, and are a great opportunity to be updated on the evolution of the global economy and strengthen the networks for interaction across central bankers. Internationally, I must also mention the great recognition that has the work of our Central Bank in other central banks and in international forums. Dear Board members, executives and all the staff: I want to tell you all that I am deeply grateful for having had the opportunity to serve my country from this position. It has been a true privilege, especially for the opportunity that provided me to strengthen this institution and in this way to contribute to build the great reputation that this institution has today in the country and elsewhere. Traveling abroad as the Governor of the Central Bank is a great satisfaction because of the way our country is seen and respected. I have been the recipient of frequent praise for our country and for this Central Bank, which is the merit of each and every one of you. I have been lucky to have also had the unconditional support of my family, who has had to endure the heavy burden that this responsibility has placed on our lives. It is true that I would have liked to end my term with an inflation rate within the target range. Sadly, some circumstances beyond our control have made it impossible. But I am certain that this is a temporary phenomena and that the Central Bank is very well prepared to comply with its price stability objective. On my part, I leave with the satisfaction of having contributed to the strengthening of this institution, so transcendental for the development and the welfare of the Chileans, to make it more credible, robust and efficient, but also more human, to earn prestige for our country and at the same time make it a great place to work in. BIS Review 149/2007 3 
Here we have people of the top level, individuals with a long trajectory and also with promising future. I ask you now to continue strengthening this institution to raise it to ever higher positions. I am grateful for all the support that the Board has given me throughout my period as Governor; I thank every manager, head of department and all the staff, from the highest to the lowest rank, for your patience, but above all, for the appreciation and affection you have shown me, especially in these last days.  I take with me beautiful memories of all these years, which, I assure you, I will never forget.  Thank you. 4 BIS Review 149/2007 
Jürgen Stark: The external dimension of monetary analysis Dinner speech by Mr Jürgen Stark, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, on the occasion of the ECB workshop on “The external dimension of monetary analysis”, Frankfurt am Main, 12 December 2007. *      *      * The role of monetary analysis in the monetary policy process remains a topic of utmost importance to all central banks, whatever the strategy they pursue.  It is pertinent to adopt a new perspective on monetary analysis, focusing on the impact of the global environment on monetary developments and how they should be assessed.  Given the recent financial turmoil that has affected global markets, in part via international capital flows and global financial linkages, it is important to link monetary analysis to international developments.  Let me come straight to the key substantive issues. In essence, I see three main topics for discussion: First: How can we assess global liquidity and what are its implications for consumer, commodity and asset prices? Second: What evidence is there of possible links between global monetary liquidity, international portfolio flows and domestic monetary growth? Third: In the context of the influences exerted by globalisation and, specifically, cross-border capital flows, what are the implications for monetary policy?  In my remarks, I will address each of these issues in turn. First of all, when talking about liquidity, it is important to clarify that, in the field of central banking and monetary policy, there are at least four distinct definitions of liquidity – each with its own implications for policy-making.  The first relates to “central bank liquidity”, which is provided to the money market in order to steer short-term interest rates.  The second refers to the general “monetary policy stance”, as summarised by the level of policy interest rates.  The third relates to “financial market” liquidity, which is defined as the ease with which large volumes of financial securities can be traded, without affecting the market price.  The fourth refers to “ monetary liquidity”, which is defined in quantitative terms on the basis of monetary and financial aggregates.  While all are important – indeed key – to monetary policy-making in the current environment of strong money and credit growth at the global level, I deem it necessary to say a few words on this last type of liquidity.  I think you would agree that it is difficult to precisely measure global monetary liquidity. There seems to be no universally accepted definition of it among economists. Several measures have been suggested and they all differ in many respects. They can be based on different monetary and credit aggregates; they may vary according to geographical coverage; and finally, they can be constructed using different types of aggregation. Even more challenging is diagnosing at what point global monetary liquidity becomes excessive. For excessive I mean liquidity that poses a medium or long-term threat to price stability or starts to boost asset prices to levels not justified by economic fundamentals. Certainly, a normative concept is needed to define excess liquidity. I hope that these two BIS Review 149/2007 1 
days will help us to make progress in reaching a common understanding on how to assess global liquidity insofar as the concept is established. Looking at the current situation, at least it can be asserted that global liquidity has been increasing at a sustained and vigorous pace over the past few years. We are also experiencing high asset prices all across the commodity markets and in some areas both, the housing markets and the stock markets. Commodity prices – notably oil and food prices – are also now rising strongly at the global level. In my view, we should be concerned about – and, as central bankers, alert to – the possibility that there may be a spillover into consumer prices. In particular, the wide availability of financial capital at low interest rates across the largest international financial markets has partly contributed to the significant rise in the prices of various assets in the recent years. Concerns about the impact of ample liquidity on asset prices – notably the underpricing of risks that has been signalled by the ECB – have been repeatedly voiced.  In the context of rapid liquidity expansion, asset prices may overshoot, leading to potentially costly boom bust cycles, the misallocation of resources and pressures on price developments. In this respect, ECB research has also shown that monetary liquidity shocks have played a role in driving asset prices during the boom phase of asset price cycles. However, the issue of empirical causality between asset prices and portfolio allocation, on the one hand, and money and credit developments, on the other, remains a subject of ongoing research. A full understanding of the dynamics and forces behind global monetary liquidity is important for providing insights into the various transmission channels through which liquidity can affect the global business cycle, asset prices and global inflation.  In the current context, if global economic growth and global liquidity are likely explanations for the recent increase in commodity prices, the resulting inflationary pressures should not necessarily be dismissed as “non-core”. The long-run impact of global commodity price pressures on inflation will depend on whether they reflect a temporary shock or a more persistent nominal trend, driven partly by ample global liquidity.  Overall, when looking at the major OECD economies, consumer price inflation has been successfully contained for quite some time now. However, for the euro area at least, the information available at the current juncture – not least the monetary data at both the area-wide and global levels – points to upside risks to price stability. Let me now address the second issue I raised earlier.  Before dealing with the evidence of possible links between global liquidity, international portfolio flows and euro area monetary growth, it is worthwhile recalling the theoretical work by James Tobin and Harry Markowitz on macroeconomics and asset pricing. The bulk of Tobin’s work in the 1950s and 1960s was on the monetary side of macroeconomics. One of his main objectives was to establish a firm foundation for the sensitivity of money demand, or money velocity, to interest rates. He argued that people may prefer liquidity, and prefer it more the lower the interest rate on non-cash assets, because individuals are risk adverse.  Over the same period, Harry Markowitz worked on portfolio choice problems, balancing risks against expected returns. Markowitz showed that under certain given conditions, an investor’s portfolio choice can be reduced to balancing two dimensions, i.e. the expected return on the portfolio and its variance.  When the Nobel Prize was announced in 1981, Tobin was asked about his work at the press conference. He tried to explain for a lay audience the idea of why it is that people hold different proportions of different assets in their portfolios.  2 BIS Review 149/2007 
He said, “Well, you know, diversification – don’t put all your eggs in one basket”. This explanation led to headlines around the world: “Yale Economist Receives Nobel Prize for ‘Don’t Put All Your Eggs in One Basket’”. A similar argument was made when the Nobel Prize was awarded to Markowitz in 1990.  Indeed the key results of Tobin’s and Markowitz’s work are labelled the “benefits of portfolio diversification”. Managers and academic economists have long been aware of the necessity of taking risk, as well as returns, into account when making portfolio decisions.  The first pioneering contributions on money and asset pricing were therefore made in the 1950s, with the analysis focusing on the case of a closed economy. In this setting, for given risks, a rise in the expected excess returns implies a lower demand for money. In the course of the last 20 years, the globalisation of financial markets owing to the reduction of transaction costs and the enhancement of information flows has increased the share of global wealth invested outside investors’ home jurisdictions. The models of Tobin and Markowitz have become, therefore, much more complicated when extending the analysis to the global environment. Portfolio theory suggested that assets should be considered imperfect substitutes for each other, with the differences in their expected yields reflecting their marginal risks regardless of the economy being open or closed. However, the representative agent model is no longer applicable in the case of an open economy, as the presence of international capital flows requires either asymmetric information or heterogeneous belief among various agents.  This makes the theoretical and empirical efforts to search for policy solutions a very complicated business. In an open economy setting, for given risks, a rise in expected excess returns does not necessarily imply a lower demand for money. Domestic assets may be purchased by foreign investors generating net portfolio inflows, which would raise domestic money growth. It is also true, however, that money and credit growth could trigger international portfolio flows. Specifically, two mechanisms can be identified through which liquidity affects international portfolio flows. First, strong money and credit growth in one country may induce capital outflows to foreign asset markets, thereby exerting upward pressure on prices for financial and real assets abroad. Second: At the same time, ample liquidity conditions in the domestic economy may fuel strong economic growth and be accompanied by higher asset prices, thereby inducing foreign capital inflows. The current magnitude of the stock of global liquidity and global savings is such that the asset prices and money growth of large economic areas, including the euro area, can be affected by them. In the same vein, large net capital inflows, as well as their sudden reversals, may also have important real consequences for large economies as they can systematically influence domestic monetary developments with potential implications for monetary policy. Evidence from the euro area shows that international portfolio flows have played an increasingly important role as a driving force for monetary dynamics.  As you are aware, the ECB’s monetary policy strategy attributes a prominent role to the analysis of monetary aggregates and their counterparts in the assessment of risks to price stability over the medium to longer term.  The growing size of international capital flows associated with globalisation of financial markets has made the analysis of monetary aggregates, for the purpose of extracting information for assessing price stability, increasingly more complex.  BIS Review 149/2007 3 
This brings me to discuss the third point: the implications of globalisation and of international capital flows for monetary policy. If globalisation and, specifically, cross-border capital flows can affect the dynamics of monetary aggregates, how can we conduct monetary policy? An improved shared understanding of the influence of global liquidity and cross-border capital flows on the monetary policy transmission mechanism is necessary to enhance the analysis underlying our decisions. Our role and responsibilities as central bankers remain intact in the globalised economy, but the performance of our task may be becoming more challenging. Certainly, there is a need for timely and open exchange of information among central banks and for further collaborative research efforts. Still, let me stress that the globalisation of financial markets does not affect the central role and overriding responsibility of central banks, which is to preserve price stability within their respective jurisdictions. Central banks throughout the world have been assigned responsibility for keeping domestic inflation at low and stable rates.  Cross-border capital flows may affect the velocity of money, but the basic principle for anchoring monetary policy – that is the Friedman’s view that “…in the long run, inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon” – remains valid. This has also been confirmed by studies that have found a strong relationship between monetary growth and inflation at low frequencies. In other words, the relationship between money and prices is stronger between the trend-like developments than between the business cycle fluctuations.  One interpretation of the international portfolio capital flows that influence monetary developments is that they introduce greater “noise” in shorter-term monetary dynamics, thereby increasing the importance of seeking the underlying rate of monetary expansion by looking at the lower-frequency, trend-like component of monetary growth. Notwithstanding the complications created by an increasingly complex international financial system, money has been, is and will remain an important indicator of inflation.  The monetary policy strategy devised by the ECB, with its medium-to-longer-term orientation and the prominence it assigns to economic and monetary analysis, is well placed to address some of the implications of globalisation for inflation dynamics and price stability. The broad analytical framework on which the ECB’s two-pillar strategy rests is well suited to detecting risks to price stability and to the economy as a whole. There is a need to intensify the analytical efforts to deepen our understanding of several aspects of financial innovations, changes in the international financial system and their implications for the assessment of medium to longer-term risks to price stability.  Indeed, as our current agenda of enhancing the monetary analyses demonstrates, the ECB is in the vanguard of developing such tools. References Adalid, R. and C.

Paul Tucker: Money and credit – banking and the macroeconomy Speech by Mr Paul Tucker, Executive Director and Member of the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England, at the Monetary Policy and the Markets Conference, London, 13 December 2007. My thanks for comments and/or for background work to Peter Andrews, Charlie Bean, Tim Besley, Roger Clews, Andy Haldane, Colin Miles, James Proudman and Iain de Weymarn. Special thanks to Jing Yang and Alex Haberis. For comments and background work to Damien Lynch. And for secretarial support to Sandra Bannister and Cheryl Feeney.  *      *      * Each month the MPC sets a policy rate, Bank Rate, that will prevail until our next policy meeting. But no one – here today, in the market, or on the Committee – thinks that setting the overnight money market rate for the coming 30 days can be enough to steer demand conditions and maintain stable inflation. Rather, policy works on the basis of expectations of the path of the Bank Rate in the future, and of how our policy settings will vary according to economic conditions: the so-called “reaction function”.  Perceptions of the reaction function therefore matter a lot and a great deal of effort goes into being transparent about the three inputs: the Committee’s objective; the MPC’s views on the shocks to demand and supply affecting the economy; and our views on how the economy works and how our policy settings affect it. This conference is focused on one important element of this: the role of financial markets in the setting and transmission of monetary policy. That is covered in the Bank’s publications on how the economy works, including the Committee’s 1999 paper on the Monetary Transmission Mechanism (MTM), and books describing the models used in forecasting.1 But those high-level descriptions miss out an awful lot about how the real and financial parts of the economy connect. Financial variables are limited to the short-term interest rate, the exchange rate, and equities. Nothing on the role of long-maturity interest rates, or on credit spreads and risk premia – which misses out a whole universe of financial asset prices. Very little on credit more generally. Next to nothing on money. And nothing at all on the role of bank intermediation. These gaps were perhaps underlined by a degree of confusion amongst commentators about the way in which Money and Credit featured somewhat more prominently in the Committee’s discussions during the backend of 2006 and into this year (Chart 1). With both having been strong for a while, some asked whether this marked some kind of change in the reaction function, implying a greater stress on nominal variables. Given the near identity of deposits and bank lending, Money and Credit are often used almost inseparably, even interchangeably, with wider measures of non-bank credit looked at only when assessing the health of corporate and household sector balance sheets. But in some circumstances one can do better to approach things the other way round, starting with general credit conditions, examining the interactions of non-bank and bank lending, and then broad money as a (partial) counterpart to M4L. My remarks today will follow that structure, which will provide a framework for some observations about the current tightening in credit conditions, as well as about the preceding expansion.                                                   1  “The transmission mechanism of monetary policy”, a paper by the Monetary Policy Committee at the Bank of England, April 1999 and Harrison R., K.

Credit Credit is, of course, vital to any economy, enabling households and firms to make choices about whether to bring forward or defer spending from income. There are conditions in which it would play no active role, passively reflecting cyclical fluctuations in output, employment and inflation. In a world of more or less complete transparency between borrowers and lenders, very low transactions costs, and very low risk aversion, access to credit would not be rationed; and ex ante yields on financial assets, including loans and bonds, would not embody risk premia. So if households and firms wanted to bring forward spending in the face of shocks to the economy, they would be able to do so restricted only by their need to remain solvent.  But nobody believes that that is a description of the real world in which households and companies manage their affairs. Both are, to a greater or lesser degree, rationed in their access to credit, given that borrowers know a great deal more about their conditions and prospects than do risk-averse lenders, and that lenders face obstacles in ensuring that borrowers honour their contracts.2 The availability, price and terms of credit– whether unsecured or secured – will be sensitive to a range of factors, including assessments of the idiosyncratic risks of a particular borrower, and the risks common across borrowers. Variations in these factors give rise to the possibility of a credit cycle.  A borrower’s ability to pledge collateral can help to overcome the problems of “asymmetric information” and enforceability, by evidencing its net worth and giving it a continuing stake in its contract with the lender. This can give rise to the so-called “financial accelerator” channel of the Monetary Transmission Mechanism (MTM), in which monetary policy works partly by affecting lending terms through its effect on asset values and so the net worth of borrowers.3  But credit conditions also depend on the access to credit of the lenders themselves. There is an important distinction here between intermediation across bank balance sheets and via the capital markets, although as I shall describe it turns out to be blurred.  Total credit: capital markets and securitisation For the moment, I shall put that distinction to one side in order to focus on total credit. A series of environmental changes over the past decade or so have affected the quantity and price of credit generally. Greater macroeconomic stability, and perceptions that it will persist more or less uninterrupted, probably increased the supply of credit; and by reducing risk premia, may have increased demand too (Diagram A).  Other developments are more likely to have worked purely through credit supply. The most obvious is the growth of instruments such as credit derivatives and securitisation, associated with an increased role for rating agencies in monitoring credit risk. This was in effect a shock to technology, making portfolios transferable. By offering the prospect of better meeting desired risk profiles and by separating origination from investment, it has brought more non-bank financial institutions, and so more capital resources, into the credit markets, increasing the supply of credit (Diagram B). This seems to have been borne out in the significant shift in actual credit quantities and prices up to the middle of this year.  In the United Kingdom, non-bank lenders have accounted for a greater share of credit extension to both the household and corporate sectors (Charts 2-4).                                                   2  Stiglitz, J. E. and A. Weiss (1981), “Credit rationing in markets with imperfect information”, The American Economic Review, Vol. 71, No. 3, pp 393-410. 3  Bernanke, B. and M. Gertler (1989), “Agency cost, net worth, and business fluctuations”, The American Economic Review, March 1989, pp 14-31. 2 BIS Review 149/2007 
A lot of that has been securitised (Chart 5). For the household sector, spreads on securitised portfolios of both secured and unsecured credit fell between 2003 and 2005 (Chart 6). That will have contributed to the fall in effective rates on the underlying mortgages and personal loans (Chart 7).  The same broad picture holds for the corporate sector (Chart 8). An illustrative decomposition suggests that, especially for sub-investment grade borrowers, the compression of spreads could not be explained solely by reduced compensation for default risk, with the excess possibly reflecting lower liquidity premia (Chart 9).4  These falls in spreads were material relative to the changes in the MPC’s Bank Rate and to the risk-free yield curve. For example, in the latest “policy cycle”, we increased Bank Rate by 125bp over 11 months from August 2006. During that period, effective rates on new mortgages rose by closer to 50bp. In other words, from around 2003, monetary policy needed to take account of a progressive loosening of credit conditions.  The tables have now turned. Spreads have risen; the issuance of securitised portfolios of household loans has collapsed; corporate bond issuance has fallen (Charts 10-11). It is pretty clear that, for the time being, there has been an adverse shift in the supply of credit from the non-banking sector. In part, that seems to be due to investors becoming less confident that they can base decisions about exposures to complex credit portfolios on rating agency ratings; this is akin to lenders deciding that their monitoring of risk was less good than they thought. In part, it is due to various types of non-bank investor in credit finding themselves facing actual or incipient liquidity pressures. Both as cause and effect, liquidity in the capital markets is impaired. This is apparent in the opening up of a so-called “negative basis” between the spreads on corporate bond and on equivalent credit-default swaps, which unbundle the transfer of credit risk from the provision of funds and so are less affected by liquidity hoarding (Chart 12).  A twin-engine financial system?  At various times over the past decade or so, it had been argued5 that the macroeconomy as a whole should be more resilient to shocks to a financial system with “twin engines” – combining capital markets with banking system intermediation of savings and credit. The argument is that when the capital markets are impaired, banking can take more of the burden, and vice versa. I have a good deal of sympathy for this view – but not for all circumstances. It rather overstates the independence of capital markets and banking, as recent developments graphically demonstrate.  First, whether through financing the purchase of credit assets by leveraged funds or warehousing portfolios prior to sale or providing “liquidity lines” to conduits and other investment vehicles, the banking system puts its capital and liquidity behind the distribution of credit risk to the wider asset-manager universe. As the official sector stressed over recent years, it is important to be clear about the circumstances in which risk can flow back to the banking system.6  Second, the “twin engines” view draws too absolute a line between banks and non-bank financial intermediaries. Alongside other asset managers, banks have been material investors in securitised credit. In some respects, it may be more useful to distinguish                                                  4  See Churm R., and L. Webber (2007), “Decomposing corporate bond spreads”, Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, Q4 2007 (forthcoming). 5  Alan Greenspan made this point a few times. 6  For example see Tucker P M W (2007), “A perspective on recent monetary and financial system developments”, speech at Merrill Lynch Conference on Hedge Funds, Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, Q3 2007, pp 310-16.

between intermediaries on the basis of whether they undertake some combination of maturity transformation, leveraging their balance sheets, and mark-to-market valuations. Banks are not alone in having these characteristics, and so there can be common shocks to bank and non-bank investors. In a recent series of papers,7 Hyun Shin has argued that balance sheet management of this kind amplifies the credit cycle. That sounds like the “financial accelerator” model, except that Shin’s position is that the outcomes can exceed those warranted by fundamentals. His argument is that in the upswing of a business cycle, the rise in asset values increases the accounting net worth of banks and other intermediaries, enabling them to leverage up their balance sheets. This expands credit; and increases the liquidity in capital markets, reducing liquidity premia embodied in asset prices; and so on. And when the music stops, the process can be reversed as falls in asset values, leverage and liquidity feed on each other. (For Shin, the villain is mark-to-market accounting, although I would not want its virtues in reducing forbearance to be overlooked.) Thirdly, the “twin engines” view may place insufficient weight on banks having remained the principal originators of credit, given that small firms and households cannot issue bonds directly into the capital markets. It has been argued that the growth of markets for securitising loan portfolios made banks less relevant to overall credit conditions, and so to the business cycle, because a bank’s ability to originate credit becomes less intimately bound up with its own financial strength.8 But if, as currently, the capital markets’ appetite for securitised credit diminishes, a larger proportion of loans will after all remain on the balance sheets of banks.  All this brings back into focus the potential macroeconomic relevance of bank lending.  Bank lending The economic literature on the “bank lending” channel of the Monetary Transmission Mechanism explores the conditions under which a tightening of monetary policy causes the terms on bank lending to tighten over and above the increase in risk-free short-term real rates. The literature has typically assumed (i) that a monetary policy tightening is effected by the central bank withdrawing reserves from the system (or slowing the pace of reserves injection); (ii) that banks are required to hold a proportion of transactions deposits in reserves, so that reduced reserves provision entails slower deposit growth; and (iii) that they do not have unrestricted access to liabilities that are not subject to reserves requirements, and so cannot fill the gap left by slower deposit growth and must, instead, slow loan growth, which they do by tightening credit conditions.9 The first two steps seem archaic. We effect monetary policy changes by controlling the price not the quantity of central bank money in the system; and, in the UK, banks choose their own reserves targets rather than having them determined by a balance sheet ratio of some kind.  But the third plank in these models – restricted access to non-deposit liabilities, whether capital-like or not – plainly is still relevant today. In a world of asymmetric information, banks do not have unrestricted access to resources, and we do not believe that a bank’s lending                                                  7  Adrian, Tobias, and H.

behaviour is invariant to its capital gearing or to the composition of its liabilities.10 We do, therefore, face questions about the extent to which a shock to banks’ liquidity or capital resources can bring about a shift in credit conditions with macroeconomic effects that, other things being equal, monetary policy should seek to offset in order to maintain aggregate demand in line with aggregate supply.  Over the past 15 years or so, when banks have seemed anything but restricted, easier access to liquidity or capital may have brought about a progressive relaxation of bank lending conditions. That this featured in commentary on monetary policy rather less than the recent manifest tightening may say no more than that sharp contractions attract more attention than gradual expansions. In a similar vein, on the whole, research does better at identifying these “credit channel” mechanisms in the context of particular stressed episodes than in longer-run averages.11Be that as it may, it is beyond doubt that there has recently been an adverse shock to bank balance sheets – involving capital, liquidity, and a potent “asymmetric” information mechanism affecting a wide range of banks. I will pick out four elements in the story, involving liquidity, counterparty-credit risk and capital.  First, near closure of the capital markets for leveraged loans, conduit and SIV commercial paper, and RMBS has left banks whose business model is “originate and distribute” unexpectedly holding on to loans and, in addition, facing the prospect of having to take assets back on to their balance sheets. The consequent reintermediation is a hit to both capital ratios and liquidity, as the banks have bigger books to fund. For these reasons alone, big picture, banks responded from August onwards by tightening loan terms and hoarding liquidity.  But the story does not end there. The second element is that access to resources (uninsured deposits) from outside the banking sector has become more restricted since the summer. While the new risk-transfer instruments have plainly dispersed risks, lack of ex ante disclosure left market participants highly uncertain about the scale and distribution of losses across the banking sector itself. On top of that, open-ended investment vehicles that have (or may have) themselves invested in structured-finance paper have felt compelled to preserve liquidity, to guard against redemption risk. And one significant source of demand for bank hybrid-capital instruments over the past half-decade or so, the SIVs, has been turned off due to their own funding problems. Taken together, the upshot for the banking system has been a shortening in the maturity of wholesale deposits, and an intermittent tightening of access to hybrid capital instruments (Chart 13).  Coming on top of an involuntary increase in risk-weighted assets and reduced access to term liquidity, the third component of the shock, apparent since late autumn, has been some actual impairment of capital resources. Large banks especially have progressively written down the values of structured-finance assets, reflecting deterioration in the underlying position of the US household sector and in the values of a wide range of leveraged instruments. But the adjustment is drawn out, partly due to uncertainty about appropriate mark-to-market valuations given the impaired liquidity in ABS markets. To avoid this process amplifying the credit cycle,12 some replenishment of common equity may be needed, and has already begun.                                                   10  In a Modigliani-Miller world of perfect capital markets, a bank’s overall cost of funds is independent of its capital and funding structure. As a result the level of bank capital and the balance of wholesale and retail funding are not relevant to bank lending decisions and so do not affect the monetary transmission mechanism. 11  Bernanke, B. S. and C. S. Lown (1991), “The credit crunch”, Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, No. 2, pp. 204-39. 12  Ashcraft, A. B., and M. Campello (2002), “Borrowers' financial constraints and the transmission of monetary policy: evidence from financial conglomerates”, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Staff Reports: 153. BIS Review 149/2007 5 
The fourth element in the story, underway since August, has been distributional. Banks relatively reliant on wholesale funding have bid up for funds. But doing so has been taken as an adverse signal, prompting further rationing of wholesale money market lending at term maturities and potentially deterring the strong from entering the market; this is what is known as a “Lemons” problem13. In the United Kingdom, since August, mortgage approvals and secured lending have declined by more at the medium-sized mortgage banks and specialist lenders than at the largest UK banks, partly due to Northern Rock (Charts 14-15). This was symmetric. Their mortgage portfolios grew faster over the previous years. All told, this looks like a manifestation of the Kashyap and Stein finding, in various non-UK settings, that lending is more cyclically variable at banks that start off with weaker balance sheets;14 or, as I would prefer to put it, with concentrated income streams and/or funding sources. Won’t the macroeconomic effect of this be dampened by the bigger and more diversified banks picking up the slack? It is important to distinguish the longer term from the near term. The longer-term impact will depend on whether the structure of the industry shifts. The securitisation boom seems to have altered the terms of trade in UK banking for a while. By reducing reliance on retail deposits, it reduced barriers to entry. Lenders’ margins fell (Chart 16), and credit conditions in the UK mortgage market eased. Conversely, the painful reminder that undiversified funding and income sources may leave a bank unusually vulnerable will probably bring about another shock to the structure of the market. The persistent tightening in mortgage credit that that would bring was a factor in the MPC’s November projections.  In the near term, the extent to which the big or more diversified banks fill the gap will depend on the extent to which they too preserve capital and liquidity in the face of the harsh environment I have described.  Money, or bank intermediation  So far I have focused entirely on credit. Where does this leave money (or Money), the starting point for much traditional monetary analysis? Well, much that I have said about banks – their capacity, in the short run, to lever up their balance sheets and expand credit at will; their role in providing liquidity insurance to investment vehicles and corporates – turns precisely on their liabilities being money. And for this reason, banks are after all decisively different from other intermediaries.  As transactions balances and so the means of exchange in our payments system, the moneyness of bank deposits lies at the core of credit intermediation. Subject only but crucially to confidence in their soundness, banks extend credit by simply increasing the borrowing customer’s current account, which can be paid away to wherever the borrower wants by the bank “writing a cheque on itself”. That is, banks extend credit by creating money. This “money creation” process is constrained: by their need to manage the liquidity risk – from the withdrawal of deposits and the draw-down of back-up lines – to which it                                                  13  Akerlof, G. A. (1970), “The market for “lemons”: quality uncertainty and the market mechanism”, Quarterly Journal of Economics, Vol. 84, No. 3, pp. 488-500. A market for “lemons” issue arises when informational deficiencies give rise to uncertainty about the true quality of a product. In such circumstances, buyers choose to pay only average prices for goods that carry the risk of sellers overstating their true quality. As a result, sellers of good products, having little incentive to participate in such markets, are driven out by those sellers of poor quality products. The most common example of the problem is the market for used new cars. Rationing in the interbank markets is discussed by Freixas, X. and J. Jorge (2007) in “The role of interbank markets in monetary policy: a model with rationing”, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Economics Working Papers. 14  Kashyap, A. K. and J. C.

exposes them.15 Adequate capital and liquidity, including for stressed circumstances, are the essential ingredients for maintaining confidence.16  If that excursion into the realm of financial stability appears to have drifted away from the immediate issue of Money, it is because the health of bank balance sheets is relevant to both the demand for money and its supply, even if this is apparent only occasionally. Charles Goodhart has already, and very usefully, stressed the importance of recovering the notion of shocks to the supply of broad money.17 In the main, however, in terms of the underlying drivers, we are talking here of shifts in the supply of broad money caused by shocks to the supply of bank lending: banks create money by extending credit (Diagram C). And as discussed earlier, key drivers in terms of bank balance sheet growth include the variables that underpin bankers’ confidence in borrowers; and, conversely, confidence in banks themselves. It should come as no surprise that the “credit channel” macroeconomic literature converged with bankers in focusing on the tangible collateral available from borrowers, and on their own capital and liquidity (which includes the ex ante and ex post terms on which they have access to central bank reserves).  Some important things can be said about this account of shifts in the supply of broad money. First, in contrast to the textbook account of shocks to the Money supply via the proverbial helicopter drop of base money (pound notes), firms and households are not caught in a bind where, in aggregate, they are forced to hold the increased supply of broad money, even if it exceeds demand. Following a shock to the supply of credit, in which some people or companies become less credit constrained, it will be open to others to reduce their existing borrowing as the extra money circulates around the economy via the purchase of goods, services and financial assets.  Second, and more important, the shocks to credit supply are, in themselves, real not nominal shocks. And like other real shocks, causing changes in the balance of Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply, there is a nominal effect only if monetary policy does not respond via alterations to the path of short-term interest rates to keep the economy on a stable path and in line with the inflation target.  Absent an appropriate policy response, the easing in monetary conditions would in time feed into inflation through an expansion of nominal spending. In the first instance, the expansion of “liquidity” represented by faster money growth may sometimes work through asset prices. That is because with imperfect substitution between different kinds of financial assets, relative risk premia may be altered, which in turn may affect borrowing conditions in capital markets.18With an appropriate policy response, what should we expect to see in bank balance sheets, in broad money growth, following a credit-supply shock? It might be that the path for broad                                                  15  See Kashyap, A. K., R. Rajan and J. C Stein (2002), “Banks as liquidity providers: an explanation for the coexistence of lending and deposit-taking”, The Journal of Finance, Vol. 57, No. 1, pp 33–73. 16  Acharya, V. V., H. S. Shin and T. Yorulmazer (2007), “Fire sales, foreign entry and bank liquidity”, C.E.P.R Discussion Paper, No. 6309. 17  See Goodhart, C. A. E.

(2007), “Central banking and political economy: the example of the UK’s Monetary Policy Committee” speech at the Inflation Targeting, Central Bank Independence and Transparency Conference, Cambridge, Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, Autumn 2007, pp445-52. 18  There is an echo here of a channel stressed by Brunner & Melter, but with the impulse coming from the central bank’s short-term interest rate rather than the quantity of reserves, and the transmission into risk premia and so other asset prices coming via the expected path of the policy rate and broad money rather than via narrow money. BIS Review 149/2007 7 
money should be unaltered in the medium term. In other words, a persistent acceleration (or deceleration) of M4 would be indicative of a nominal shock, jeopardising achievement of the inflation target. The world is not so simple, however. The underlying drivers of the change in the supply of bank lending, and so in broad money, may also bring about shifts in the demand for money, validating a different level for real money balances – perhaps most obviously, if investment and so the economy’s productive capacity were affected. For some underlying shocks, it is probably better to think about the effects on banking intermediation rather than simply on bank lending. Faced with a change in their costs and opportunities, bankers might sometimes be able to adjust the terms on either their assets or their liabilities (or both). Currently, banks have incurred an adverse shock to their wholesale funding (Chart 17). The evidence so far suggests that, as well as tightening terms for borrowers, they are improving rates offered on retail deposits.  Where does that leave us on Money? It is clear enough from the long-run relationship between money growth and inflation that prolonged shifts in money growth can be an amber light (Chart 18). And possible liquidity effects mean that, through risk premia, shifts in the quantity of money may feed back into financial asset markets and so into broader credit conditions. But there are no “easy wins” when it comes to analysing Money demand and supply.19  Money and credit in the current conjuncture  Those challenges are certainly apparent right now. Judging from a combination of market intelligence, surveys and prices, there is no doubt that credit conditions for both households and firms have tightened materially. The Bank’s new Credit Conditions Survey, published for the first time in September, recorded a clear tightening in availability of credit to corporates over the previous quarter. A month later, a mini-survey unsurprisingly revealed tighter conditions for households too.20 Spreads on corporate and household credit are already higher across the board; and for risky borrowers, financing costs have risen notwithstanding the fall in risk-free yields.  Since August, the MPC has stressed, however, that it will not be sufficient in these circumstances to look solely at the price of credit, as there could be increased quantity rationing. The standard view is that households and small firms are more likely to be adversely affected in such circumstances than large firms, which typically have greater access to capital markets. But as this disturbance affected the wholesale loan markets, we will need to monitor conditions for corporate bond and loan issuance. Indeed, we will need to look at total credit, and carefully across different sectors to track the impact of the tightening. But timely and rich data are available on just bank lending. And interpreting them is not straightforward given the nature of the shock to the system. If reintermediation is significant, banks will be taking back on to their balance sheets conduit and investment vehicle paper or just holding onto loans for longer than usual before they can be sold onto the capital markets.                                                  19  Perhaps nothing illustrates this as cleanly as the advent of credit derivatives. Derivatives of any kind unbundle funding (and so liquidity risk) from the underlying risk to which an agent is seeking exposure via a particular contract. So a credit derivative unbundles credit risk from funding. This further complicates interpretation of the bank lending data (M4L). Imagine that, due to their customer networks and screening capability, banks originate all credit, but that they use credit-default swaps to shed a great portion of the credit risk via CDS to non-bank financial institutions. In the limit, this would be a world in which M4L correctly measured (bank) lending and M4 was one useful measure of “liquidity”. But it would also be a world in which shocks to credit conditions from capital and risk appetite worked largely through non-bank lenders, and in which shocks to liquidity worked largely through depositor confidence in the banking system. In the real world, this story underlines the need to look at total credit, and to analyse the monetary data with finesse. 20  See Bank of England Inflation Report, November 2007, Section 1 on “Money and Asset Prices”, pages 16-17. 8 BIS Review 149/2007 
It cannot be ruled out that, for a while, the M4L growth rate may deceive as to the underlying pace of credit expansion in the economy.  That is important because, in a nutshell, the turmoil in financial markets is not just a “City” event. How potent it will be macroeconomically will depend on how long current conditions persist, and the feedback loop between the financial economy and the real economy. As to its persistence, necessary conditions for an alleviation of the current strains in credit markets are probably at least twofold. First, that the US housing and household debt markets stabilise. Second, that banks and other financial intermediaries recognise impairments to asset values, so that uncertainties about counterparty credit risks begin to reduce.  On the financial-real economy interaction, we must try to avoid a vicious circle in which tighter liquidity conditions, lower asset values, impaired capital resources, reduced credit supply, and slower aggregate demand feed back on each other. A variety of policy responses are possible. The announcement yesterday by central banks of co-ordinated action via term auctions to alleviate pressure in financing markets is directed at that. Second, regulatory authorities around the world are monitoring banks’ liquidity and capital positions, including in the context of Basel II. And, thirdly, monetary policy also can in principle play a role, through what is effectively a “financial accelerator” working through bank balance sheets, where that is consistent with maintaining stable inflation in the medium term. In the UK, the starting point has been robust domestic demand; the leveraged-buyout sector aside, generally healthy corporate balance sheets; somewhat more vulnerable household balance sheets;21 and potentially stretched commercial and residential property prices.  At the Committee’s November meeting, I explored the case for an “insurance cut” addressed to the downside risks from tightening credit conditions. The case for such a cut was strengthened by Bank Rate, at 5¾%, standing at a level that was most probably mildly restrictive. But that had to be weighed against the upward pressures on inflation stemming largely from the rise in energy and other commodity prices. Our November projections seemed to me likely to validate the expectation already embodied in the money market curve that Bank Rate would over time be lowered, representing some offset to the tightening in liquidity and credit premia. That being so, on balance, I concluded that an immediate cut was not necessary; and that “no change” would give the Committee a valuable opportunity to explain in the Inflation Report the implications of both the credit and commodity shocks, underlining that the Committee remains focused on anchoring inflation expectations and so achieving the inflation target over the medium term. Looking ahead, I noted the importance of distinguishing between, on the one hand, the passing through into the macroeconomy of the shocks that had already occurred to credit conditions and to commodity prices; and, on the other hand, the possibility of new shocks on either or both fronts.  That was my starting point for our December meeting, the minutes of which will be published next week.  Summary and conclusions  Let me try to pull together some of my central themes.                                                  21  “…households have increased their debt….more debt unavoidably leaves them more vulnerable to bad luck, eg adverse economic shocks”, Tucker, P. M. W. (2003), “Credit conditions and monetary policy”, speech at the Leeds Financial Services Initiative, Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, Autumn 2003, p. 373. BIS Review 149/2007 9 
I have stressed that we should take care to avoid talking about money when we mean credit. In a similar spirit, we should be clear when we mean total credit and when bank lending, but without assuming the two are divorced. I have also stressed the need for attention to the underlying drivers of credit conditions throughout the economic cycle. In today’s financial system, we may well need richer data on credit quantities and flows outside the banking sector, perhaps along the lines of the US Flow of Funds statistics. The Bank’s new Credit Conditions Survey is also designed to give us better qualitative information to put alongside the quantity and price data. Even so, as with asset prices more generally, we will sometimes find it hard to distinguish between changes in credit conditions warranted by fundamentals and those that are not. Failure to recognise fundamentally warranted and sustainable shifts would deplete welfare. But it is distinctly uncomfortable for the world’s central banks to rely entirely on mopping up after a bubble bursts: one imbalance can lead to another.22 The central banking community does not yet have a satisfactory way through this dilemma.  And Money? It occupies one end of the liquidity spectrum, and so changes in the quantity of money might potentially affect risk premia, and so credit conditions more generally. Gauging that is a formidable challenge. As an input to policy, there is just no alternative to getting one’s hands dirty in analysing the monetary data. With an institutional rather than functional definition of broad money, special care is needed not to be misled by shifts in the demand for money from the plethora of non-bank financial institutions. This is important if we are to use money as an indicator of nominal trends alongside survey and financial-market-based measures of inflation expectations.  That brings me back to where I began: with our policy reaction function. Occasionally the markets will be surprised by our policy decisions. But we should do all we can to avoid confusion about how we think about the economy and about monetary policy strategy. In the spring, my own view of the signals from broad money had not altered materially. So today I have tried to explain how I think about money, credit and the connections between them. That has provided a framework for some observations on the current conjuncture, underlining the need for careful attention to conditions in the banking system. Central banks should be, and need to be, well placed to undertake that analysis, which has rarely been more important than now.                                                   22  I argued this in Tucker, P. M. W. (2006), “Reflections on operating inflation targeting”, speech at the Chicago Graduate School of Business, Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, Summer 2006, p. 220. 10 BIS Review 149/2007

Radovan Jelašić: Key challenges for Serbia and the surrounding region Speech by Mr Radovan Jelašić, Governor of the National Bank of Serbia, at the Conference of Economist Media Group “Financial Services in the South East Europe”, Belgrade, 5 December 2007. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen, As Serbia slowly but finally returns to Europe, the issues we face are becoming more and more “European” and even “international”. Allow me to share with you today my thoughts on some of the current topics which represent key challenges not only to us in the NBS, but to almost all neighbouring countries! Stable and efficient banking sector represents the key prerequisite and a guarantee of macroeconomic stability in Serbia today. However, no supervisory measure is more efficient in “levelling off” the margins or “convincing” institutions to cut down credit growth than a crisis situation in the financial sector. Whereas bank supervisors are constantly vigilant and keep taking measures to avert a crisis, crises still happen all the time. And they all have something in common: 1) they are never planned though risk trends are more or less common knowledge, 2) they come as a result of operations that are almost impossible to predict, 3) their initial impact is always underestimated, but soon 4) goes into the other extreme, i.e. becomes overestimated! For seven years now, namely ever since I began attending Annual Meetings of the IMF and the World Bank in Washington, G-8 member countries and the IMF staff have been giving their semi-annual reports on “orderly winding down of global imbalances”. Almost everybody seems convinced that what we have been going through in recent months is actually the beginning of orderly winding down of global imbalances, though neither the length nor the depth of the process can be predicted with any precision yet! Strong financial sector in terms of the volume of its capital and reserves, and/or ownership structure is more than indispensable against the background of growing external and internal risks. On the eve of 2008, we are faced with many more challenges and unknowns both in Serbia and wider. Allow me to name just a few: • Risk revaluation in the world market – while most of us remained quite unaware, only a few, like the UK-based Northern Rock Bank, realized that we had stepped from excess liquidity into the opposite extreme practically overnight. The terms on which Serbia borrowed in the world financial market only six months ago seem quite unattainable today even to some countries that recently joined the EU. Besides, the financial market is expected to be much more critical of some banks which until only recently managed to quite easily cleanse their balance sheets through securitization! In all, “seven years of fat cows, i.e. high liquidity” is already long behind us, and even if it still prevails in some isolated spots, it is exclusively due to massive support primarily from the central banks in the Euro Zone, England, Switzerland, and more recently the USA!  • Inflation challenges, primarily in the Euro Zone, seem to be ever more present, and the ECB is sailing between the Scylla and Haribda. Inflation in Germany has reached its 13 year high, M3 continues to grow fast – and these are the two main signals used by the ECB when deciding on the level of its reference rate. On the other hand, economic growth is losing its momentum, financial sector issues seem more and more complicated every day, and the currency is getting stronger with all its positive (e.g. cheaper imports of energy products) and negative effects (loss of competitiveness, primarily in the USA). It has been long since the money, i.e. cash, BIS Review 148/2007 1 
was as expensive as it is in today’s market notwithstanding the above injection of liquidity by central banks!  • The issue of home – host supervision comes back as a boomerang with every new crisis in the banking sector. Be it BACAG in Austria or IKB in Germany, the issue remains the same – distribution of responsibilities is being redesigned, both within the country (Austria) and at the level of the EU (e.g. Northern Rock bank).  We have been scrutinizing all of the above factors primarily from the aspect of their impact on Serbia, in which a) relatively easy and cheap borrowing abroad represents the key prerequisite to financing of the BOP deficit, b) inflationary pressures in the Euro Zone due to high level of eurization spill over into Serbia relatively quickly, and c) 80% of the banking sector is in the majority ownership of well ranked strategic owners from EU countries. Internal factors: • Inflationary pressures in Serbia are growing under the influence of both external and internal factors. And while the possibility to influence external factors seems quite negligible even by much bigger countries than Serbia, I am of the opinion that we should focus on issues which are exclusively under our control. Pleasant words, “stunts” from the past or delaying price increases cannot do the trick, not in the medium run, and even less in the long run. Though we in the NBS are satisfied with the core inflation result achieved in the course of the current year despite the untimely elections and the related fiscal expansion, doubling of the price of oil, and the drought, on the eve of 2008 we are more than concerned and put a question to ourselves: Should the prevailing tendencies persist, can the NBS reach its objectives with the instruments at its disposal or must there be new ones added? One thing is for sure, to achieve our objectives, we shall use all the instruments at our disposal, both old and new, but that shall not make us popular. That much I can tell in advance.  • High exposure to foreign currency risk creates additional risks to the financial sector as confirmed by the developments during last two weeks. If arguments extended by the NBS on the need to borrow in dinars do not seem plausible enough, I sincerely hope that recent developments in the market shall force many to reconsider which currency they should borrow in, namely, how to minimize their exposure to the foreign currency risk. The role of banks is of the highest importance in terms of warning against foreign currency risk exposure, if not for the sake of their clients than for the sake of their own balance sheet results!  • In the absence of adequate market competition, price signals are transferred slowly and inaccurately. This is most evident in the case of prolonged and high appreciation of the dinar which is transferred to retail prices with a significant delay. World practice points to the rigidity of prices, but it seems that they are practically “cemented” in Serbia today. I sincerely hope that something shall be done in that respect, and done exclusively for economic reasons. All in all, from the macroeconomic point of view, both internal and external challenges require that banks, unless they have already done so, reassess which way and how to proceed.  In his biography, Alan Greenspan says that market produces constant stress as in order for someone to gain, someone else has to lose. I fear that many are not yet aware that the market is not a guarantee, but a chance to make money! And finally, allow me to go back to where I started from. Strong and stable banking sector, primarily in terms of high quality and reliable ownership structure, represents a solid foundation for macroeconomic stability. Despite all the risks, I remain optimistic that we shall be successful in overcoming all of the above challenges. 2 BIS Review 148/2007 
Lucas Papademos: ECB Financial Stability Review December 2007 Opening remarks by Mr Lucas Papademos, Vice President of the European Central Bank, at the press briefing on the occasion of the publication of the December 2007 ECB Financial Stability Review, Frankfurt am Main, 12 December 2007. *      *      * I. Introduction My colleagues and I would like to welcome you to today’s press briefing on the occasion of the publication of the December 2007 edition of the ECB Financial Stability Review. The financial stability assessment contained in the Review has been prepared with the close involvement of the ESCB Banking Supervision Committee. It is for the most part based on information that was available up until 9 November 2007, the “cut-off” date for this Review.  The primary objective of the FSR is to identify and evaluate the main sources of risk and vulnerability to financial stability and to provide a comprehensive assessment of the capacity of the euro area financial system to absorb adverse disturbances. The December 2007 edition of the Review places special emphasis on the financial market turmoil, which is also the focus of the overview chapter. This edition of the Review addresses several topical issues in 19 boxes and also contains five Special Feature articles. The choice of the content of some of these boxes and articles has been motivated by the financial market developments over the past few months.  In my presentation, I will first devote some time to the ongoing financial market turmoil. Second, I will review the risks and vulnerabilities in the external environment as well as in the euro area financial and non-financial sectors, which are partially affected by the re-pricing of financial risk. I will conclude with an overall assessment of the risks to euro area financial stability, as we currently see them.  2. The financial market turmoil 2.1  Causes Starting with the market turmoil, the principal and underlying cause for the market tensions and volatility that erupted in August is that, over the past few years, several intertwined vulnerabilities were created by a mutually reinforcing interplay between three developments: (1) a strengthening investor risk appetite and a search for yield; (2) a sizeable expansion of financial market liquidity from mid-2003 onwards; and (3) the increasingly widespread adoption by banks of the “originate and distribute” business model.  More specifically, in an environment of historically low risk-free asset yields, the search for yield by investors made it necessary to seek and acquire alternative assets offering higher returns but associated with greater risks. These assets included complex structured finance products that are relatively illiquid. The “search-for-yield” phenomenon is evidenced by the compression of credit spreads and the decline in market volatility over the past four years (see chart on the left of slide 3).  Against this background, banks pursuing the “originate and distribute” business model met a growing base of highly receptive investors willing to include in their portfolios riskier loans re-packaged into increasingly complex structured credit products. While the “originate and distribute” business model facilitated a wider distribution of credit risk across the financial systems, there were growing concerns among the global central banking community that this model was reducing the degree of transparency concerning the ultimate location of risks in the financial system. The amount of loans securitised in euro denominated markets has BIS Review 148/2007 1 
grown over the past three years (see chart on the right of slide 3). The tendency of European banks to resort to securitisation of loans has allowed them to dispose of the credit risk and at the same time it has fuelled banks’ loan growth on the supply side.  Before elaborating on the risks emanating from the interaction of the three aforementioned factors, it might be worth recalling how the ECB saw the situation six months ago, before the financial market turmoil gathered pace. In this context, let me refer to some pertinent quotes and conclusions included in the June 2007 FSR (see slide 4).  • First, we had highlighted the potential of the US sub-prime mortgage market crisis deepening and spreading to other markets, to which euro area financial institutions could have exposures.  • Second, we had stressed the prospect of financial market liquidity abruptly drying up when investor risk aversion rises and had warned that an abrupt and sharp decline in market liquidity could reveal vulnerabilities in the financial system.  • Third, concerns had been expressed about the implications of the growing reliance on rating agencies in credit risk assessment.  • Fourth, we had discussed the possible loosening of standards and compromising of counterparty risk management at the margin by some banks in an environment of intensifying competition about lucrative fee income.  • Fifth, we pointed out that reduced financial market liquidity had the potential to hamper banks’ ability to sell securitised risky loans and thus adversely affect the credit cycle.  2.2.  Propagation channels Let me now elaborate on the various stages and the propagation of the turbulence as this is useful for the assessment of the prospects for the financial markets and for deriving some lessons. At the early stages of the crisis, when it was still contained to the US sub-prime mortgage markets, delinquency rates on US sub-prime mortgages increased markedly after mid-2005, for two main reasons. First, the interest rate charged on sub-prime mortgages is initially much lower than for a standard mortgage, but it is typically reset to a much higher rate, usually after a two to three year period. Second, high rates of house price inflation since the early 1990s had encouraged some households to borrow for house purchases with the intention of refinancing, or repaying the mortgage, before the reset date. Once interest rates on these mortgages started to rise, and house prices began to moderate and subsequently to fall, many borrowers were unable to service their loans, sometimes even before the reset date if they had been aggressively betting on further house price increases. The developments in delinquency rates and house price inflation are shown in the charts on slide 5.  What are the prospects for the sub-prime mortgage markets? Recall that the typical fixed-rate period for adjustable-rate mortgages is two to three years, after which they are reset and tied to one of a number of common indices, which are closely related to market interest rates. Notwithstanding a slight decrease in these indices as of recently, an estimated USD 400 billion of sub-prime mortgages will face a reset in interest rates over the next two years.  The surge in delinquency rates quickly translated into falling values of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBSs), especially those backed by the most recently originated vintages of loans. The values of such securities, and the indices of credit default swaps (CDSs) on such securities, have mostly continued to deteriorate until today (see chart on the left of slide 6); Box 2 of the Review examines these issues in detail.  The fact that claims on the cash-flows generated by sub-prime mortgages were embedded in a broad array of structured credit products, often layered on top of one another, explains why 2 BIS Review 148/2007 
the unexpectedly severe credit losses on the underlying US sub-prime mortgages and the risk of potential future credit losses had such widespread effects on the financial system.  The announcement by some rating agencies in early July that they would downgrade many asset-backed securities (ABSs) and collateralised debt obligations (CDOs) backed by pools of sub-prime mortgages and that they would be revising their methodologies for assigning new ratings resulted in a loss of confidence in ratings and caused investors to fundamentally reassess the expected distribution of returns on a wide variety of structured finance products and the risks embedded in these products. These developments contributed to an increase in risk aversion and a substantial decline in market liquidity (as illustrated in the chart on the right of slide 6) and resulted in a sharp drop in issuance volumes in structured credit and leveraged loan markets.  One of the main channels of propagation and amplification of the financial market turmoil proved to be the off-balance sheet vehicles created by banks for clients or for themselves to invest in structured finance products. Money-market fund managers and other investors apparently had underestimated the exposure they were incurring towards the risks in US sub-prime mortgages by purchasing asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) issued by these vehicles. Box 8 of the Review provides a detailed explanation of the various ABCP structures and how they were affected by the market turmoil. Ultimately, a liquidity squeeze was triggered in the unsecured interbank money markets because of the larger-than-expected funding liquidity needs, or perceived future needs, of some banks with liquidity commitments to off-balance sheet vehicles, which had become unable to roll over a large share of their ABCP in the market. At the same time, other financial institutions with liquidity balances tended to hoard them.  Box 9 of the Review discusses the various reasons for this hoarding behaviour which has persisted until the present. The first is an adverse selection problem: counterparties with liquid balances have found themselves unable to distinguish between financial institutions that have sizeable exposures to structured credit products and those who do not. Second, banks have hoarded liquidity for precautionary reasons because of heightened uncertainty about their own potential funding liquidity needs. Third, money-market funds have also built up precautionary liquid balances to cover the risk of potential redemption requests by investors.  I will not review here in detail the central bank operations that aimed to ensure the orderly functioning of the money market as they have been discussed on several occasions, and are summarised in the Review. The ECB acted swiftly and decisively, with several refinancing operations, including initially operations of very short maturities and then of three-month maturity to address tensions in the term money market. It has also provided additional liquidity, above the benchmark allotment amount, in the context of the regular main refinancing operations (MROs) but has continued to aim at balanced liquidity conditions at the end of the maintenance period. These operations have had stabilising effects on money market rates, by reducing the volatility of the very short-term interbank rate around the key policy rate of the ECB and by containing pressures in the interbank term money market. They have thus contributed to mitigating the effects of the turmoil on the financial system and the economy.  However, tensions have persisted in the term money markets, as shown by the spreads between euro deposit rates of different maturities and EONIA swap rates which have remained at elevated levels (see the chart on the left of slide 7). Continuing pressures have characterised the term money markets globally, including the US dollar, euro and pound sterling money markets (as shown by the chart on the right of slide 7). A main reason for this is the persistence of uncertainties surrounding the financial positions and liquidity needs of financial institutions.  BIS Review 148/2007 3 
2.3  Lessons Let me now turn to the lessons that have been learned so far from the market turmoil. Although it is too early to draw definite conclusions, a number of weaknesses that have been revealed by the turmoil could be generally considered as a consequence of inadequate risk management by some institutions and insufficient market discipline. But let me be more specific and point to four broad areas of weakness in risk management which partly relate to the originate-and-distribute banking model and concern (i) the monitoring, assessment and management of credit risk; (ii) the management and pricing of funding liquidity risk ; (iii) the assessment of counterparty risk and (iv) the role of the so-called conduits and structured investment vehicles in such a model and in the transmission of tensions from the credit and structured finance product markets to the money markets. Many of these weaknesses had been previously identified. But they combined in such a way that few had anticipated the potential severity of their joint impact on the core money markets.  Several issues related to these risks and weaknesses require further examination, which is currently being undertaken by various fora, namely the Financial Stability Forum and the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision.  One important issue concerns the valuation of complex structured finance products. Investors who had assumed that the model-based ratings for structured credit products had similar statistical properties to those for corporate bonds discovered that these products were very different. For example, the so-called bespoke Collateralised Debt Obligations (CDOs) have became impossible to value in an acceptably precise manner and, at the current juncture, efforts are made to either mark-to-market the products using some comparable tradable asset prices or the latest available price quotes.  Another problem – closely related to the valuation issue – is the role the rating agencies have played in the development of structure finance products and the propagation of the turmoil as well as the excessive reliance of investors on ratings in their credit risk assessments. Questions have also been raised about the potential conflicts of interest in the activities of rating agencies.  Finally, with regard to funding liquidity risk, an important ingredient in the turmoil which contributed to the propagation of tensions from the credit markets to the money market, was the maturity mismatch on the balance sheets of ABCP conduits. The risks associated with these funding mismatches were further aggravated when market liquidity evaporated from the markets for complex structured credit products. In addition, it became clear that banks often did not have adequate contingency plans in place to deal with unexpected funding liquidity needs arising from the contingent liquidity facilities they had provided to conduits or to deal with the risk that they would face difficulty in syndicating the bridge loans they had extended to finance leveraged buyouts.  Looking forward, at the current juncture the outlook for the subsequent evolution of the sub-prime originated turmoil is highly uncertain. In order to obtain some indication on the possible propagation of market tensions, I would like to refer to Box 5 in the Review which focuses on the interactions between credit and market de-leveraging cycles. It concludes that in an environment in which bank loans are widely used as collateral for asset-backed securities, a sudden increase in borrower default rates could have implications on the financial performance of banks not only via credit risks, but also through market and income risks. From this perspective, an important issue for the euro area and global financial stability outlook is the way in which the ongoing re-pricing of credit risk feeds into the evolution of the credit cycle. A crucial channel that will determine the impact of money market tensions and the re-pricing of credit risk on the credit cycle and the real economy is the extent to which they will affect banks’ lending behaviour and, consequently, the financing conditions of households and the corporate sector. Indications of a considerable tightening of lending standards have already emerged on both sides of the Atlantic (see chart on the left of slide 9). In addition, there are 4 BIS Review 148/2007 
signs that corporate default rates – which reached historically low levels in recent years – are forecast to increase both in the US and in the euro area (as shown in the chart on the right of slide 9). In the event that continued or increased market tensions and volatility would constrain banks’ ability to extend credit to the non-financial sectors, the turn in the broader credit cycle could be accelerated and the downside risks to economic activity could increase. So far, however, bank credit expansion to the private sector in the euro area has remained robust. 3.  The external macro-financial environment Let me now turn to the other risks and vulnerabilities that have been identified in the FSR which pertain to the external environment and the euro area financial and non-financial sectors. Most of these risks have been previously stressed, but recent developments have a bearing on the likelihood that they materialise or on the expected impact on the euro area financial system and economy.  The significant appreciation of the euro vis-à-vis the US dollar over the past months has had some implications for the outlook for the adjustment of global imbalances, notably for the financing of the US current account deficit (see the chart on the left of slide 10). The financial market re-pricing seems to have triggered a noticeable change in the pattern of capital flows to the US. In July 2007, foreign net acquisitions of US long-term securities declined sharply and investors rebalanced their portfolios towards short-term instruments. In the following month, the US recorded net outflows from long-term securities (particularly equities), as well as a decrease in short-term liabilities. Although some of this capital appeared to flow back into the US capital markets in the months that followed, these events underlined the potential of a disorderly unwinding of imbalances in the case of financing challenges for the US external deficit.  Aggregate demand and inflation pressures globally, and in the euro area in particular, have been affected by the substantial and persistent rise in oil prices, although the simultaneous appreciation of the euro has dampened the impact on the euro area economy. Limited spare capacity amid robust demand especially from emerging economies, and continued geopolitical and supply risks are likely to keep oil prices at elevated levels as can be inferred from futures markets. However, there is considerable uncertainty which is skewed to the upside, as indicated by the implied distribution for future oil prices, extracted from options contracts (see chart on the right of slide 10). 4.  Euro area corporate and household sectors Turning to the vulnerabilities in the euro area economy, while the financial position of the euro area corporate sector has remained relatively sound at an aggregate level, the likelihood of a turn in the credit cycle, while still low, may have risen. This is because the amount of debt on firms’ balance sheets has continued to grow, as has the cost of rolling over short-term debt. Corporate profitability, although high, could be adversely affected by a less favourable macroeconomic outlook, tighter credit standards and the higher cost of debt.  One issue highlighted on several occasions throughout the current year is the risk associated with leverage buy-out (LBO) transactions. The financing packages granted to the largest LBO projects finalised in 2006 and 2007 were characterised by excesses that bear some similarities to the practices in the US sub-prime mortgage markets. A further deterioration of financing conditions could cause some of the firms involved to default, with adverse consequences to the collateralised loan obligation (CLO) market where LBO loans are frequently used in asset pools. In addition, a number of new large LBO deals have been delayed or restructured and some planned transactions have been withdrawn from the market due to the turmoil (see chart on the left of slide 11). All in all, most market-based indicators suggest that the current outlook for the euro area non-financial corporate credit BIS Review 148/2007 5 
quality, while deteriorating somewhat, still remains overall fairly solid. Default rates have remained low, but they started to rise in the second half of 2006 for the first time since 2003 and are expected to rise further in the period ahead. The balance between credit rating upgrades and downgrades of non-financial corporations remained at a level close to that observed over the previous years. With regard to risks in the euro area household sector, despite some heterogeneity across euro area countries, the latest available data confirm a gradual moderation in the annual rate of house price inflation. In those countries where overvaluation appears to be most acute, house market price developments continue to represent a source of risk for household sector balance sheets, although income growth will typically be a more decisive determinant of the overall risk to household finances in euro area economies. At the same time, the growth rate of lending to households for house purchases has continued to decrease on average in the euro area, suggesting that the liability side of the households’ balance sheet has also grown more slowly (see chart on the right of slide 11).  However, the continuing rise, although at moderating pace, of household sector indebtedness and the signs of vulnerability in some housing markets add to the credit risk faced by euro area banks in the short to medium term. All in all, vulnerabilities could be exposed in those parts of the euro area where residential real estate valuations are particularly stretched, where households are highly leveraged, and where borrowing has taken place primarily at variable interest rates and where loan-to-value ratios are high. The analysis presented in Box 6 concludes that due to the on average relatively comfortable loan-to-value ratios, it would take a sizeable house price decline in addition to any adverse disturbance to the debt servicing capacity of mortgage borrowers before banks would incur large credit losses.  5.  Euro area financial institutions  During the past few weeks, the focus on the implications of the financial market turmoil has concentrated on its potential effects on banks’ balance sheets and profitability. While the financial conditions of euro area large and complex banking groups (LCBGs) has further improved in the first half of 2007, the extent of the negative impact of the ongoing credit risk re-pricing on their financial condition will become clear gradually as they report their full year 2007 audited financial results.  Based on data obtained from publicly available sources, Box 11 in the Review presents an analysis of the outcome of a simple stress-test pertaining to 21 LCBGs’ funding needs and capital ratios. Among these euro area LCBGs, 18 have exposures to ABCP programmes and 9 to leveraged loan warehousing risks. In aggregate, the exposures correspond to an additional funding requirement for these banks which represent 5.2% of their total outstanding loans, or 10.4% of their deposit base. This additional funding requirement, should it materialise, is likely to adversely affect these institutions’ earnings prospects.  In a stress scenario where these exposures are fully taken back onto the balance sheets of the sponsoring banks, but where no potential second round effects are accounted for, some banks would see their capital ratios declining quite substantially, but even the worst hit institutions would still remain solvent (see chart on the left of slide 12). However, because many LCBGs may also target some particular capital ratio above the regulatory minima in the pursuit of higher credit ratings, deteriorating capital ratios could have adverse consequences for their credit quality and future funding costs. All in all, it cannot be excluded that the market re-pricing process could become more disorderly, possibly revealing further and, so far hidden, risk exposures. Moreover, dividend policies could be adversely affected for several institutions. In addition, those LCBGs that rely on funding from non-deposit sources, and those that are particularly active in the securitisation businesses, could see their revenues decline significantly. Reflecting these 6 BIS Review 148/2007 
concerns, forward-looking financial market indicators, such as banks’ CDS spreads and share prices, currently suggest that challenges pertaining to the banking sector are likely to remain in the near future (see the chart on the right of slide 12).  The market turbulence has also raised concerns about the extent and nature of euro area insurers’ exposures to structured credit products. Against that background, some insurers have chosen to disclose their exposures to the US sub-prime mortgage asset-backed securities at the end of the first half of 2007 as shown in box 17 in the Review. These data shows that the exposures in general are limited, on average less than 1% of overall invested assets, and that they mostly relate to high-rated investment segments. These rather limited exposures, especially when compared with the US monoline insurers, can be explained by the differences in business models of euro area insures and by the fact that they had limited appetite for high levels of credit risk. Nevertheless, while euro area insurers might have fairly limited direct exposure to US sub-prime mortgages or more generally to structured credit products, secondary effects of the ongoing credit market turmoil might be of greater concern.  6.  Overall assessment of the financial stability outlook Let me now provide an overall assessment of the risks to the outlook for the euro area financial stability, as we see it at the current juncture.  With financial systems undergoing a process of de-leveraging and re-intermediation, the uncertainty surrounding the financial stability outlook for the euro area has heightened. This uncertainty could persist for a considerable period of time until it becomes clearer how the total valuation and income losses, which could be sizeable, facing the euro area financial system will be spread across individual financial institutions. Clarity will also be needed on how liquidity providers intend to deal with their commitments to off-balance sheet investment vehicles, and how much risk will eventually flow back onto the balance sheets of banks. Moreover, until conditions in the US housing market show signs of improvement, the possibility of further tensions surfacing in structured credit markets cannot be excluded, especially if credit quality were to deteriorate in the broader US mortgage market.  As the adjustment process in the financial sector over the coming months is likely to prove challenging, the financial system could be more vulnerable than before to the crystallisation of other risks that have been identified in previous issues of the FSR and which remain relevant.  Specifically, these risks are related to the following facts and developments: First, within the euro area, the substantial increase in household sector indebtedness together with signs of vulnerability in some housing markets adds to the credit risk facing euro area banks in the short to medium term. Second, the surge of leverage in parts of the corporate sector, especially that associated with LBO activity, raises the possibility of an adverse turn in the credit cycle involving a rise in the default rates of the most heavily indebted firms. Third, although so far the hedge fund sector was relatively unaffected by the recent market turmoil, some uncertainties remain regarding hedge funds’ exposures to credit markets, as well as their leverage and liquidity risk. Finally, outside the euro area, persistently wide global imbalances continue to pose a risk that they will be unwound in a disorderly manner. This could bring about further tensions in global capital markets and, if this risk were to materialise, it could pose a challenging test for the risk management and loss-absorption capacities of key financial institutions.  All in all, the risks to euro area financial system stability have materially increased over the past 6 months. There are, however, several mitigating factors: The economic outlook remains broadly favourable and, although pockets of vulnerability can be identified, the balance sheets of households and firms are largely in good shape, BIS Review 148/2007 7 
supporting the overall creditworthiness of the non-financial sector. Moreover, the capital positions of core financial firms are also generally sound.  This overall positive assessment of shock-absorbing capacity should not provide any grounds for complacency given the heightened uncertainties. In an environment where balance sheet conditions could unexpectedly change, vigilance is of the essence and financial institutions in particular should step up their efforts to effectively manage the risks that may lie ahead.  In this respect, recently launched initiatives and measures that are being taken, both by policy-makers and by the financial industry, aimed at restoring confidence and addressing the weaknesses that have been revealed by the market turmoil should contribute to strengthening the resilience of the financial system. I would like to stress particularly the importance of the new Basel II Capital Accord, which is to be fully implemented by January 2008. Indeed, the new accord strongly relies on significantly improved risk management in determining the appropriate level of capital buffers for banks. Nevertheless, and despite these improvements, the degree of sophistication of financial markets also calls for constant investment in stress-testing methods and practices in order to ensure that banks have full understanding of the potential losses they might incur in highly unlikely but plausible scenarios and that they are adequately prepared to address the associated risks.      8 BIS Review 148/2007

David Dodge: Reflections on developments in the Canadian financial system Remarks by Mr David Dodge, Governor of the Bank of Canada, to the Canadian Club of Toronto and the Empire Club of Canada, Toronto, Ontario, 10 December 2007.  *      *      * I'm happy to be here in my home town of Toronto to deliver my final public speech as Governor of the Bank of Canada. Nearly seven years ago, I gave my first public speech in Toronto, so it is fitting that I should be here for my last. It has become a tradition that I deliver a speech late in the year on issues related to the financial system. When I say "financial system," I mean financial institutions and markets, together with the clearing and settlement systems through which financial assets flow. This tradition of speaking about the financial system began in 2004 with a speech I gave to a joint meeting of the Empire and Canadian Clubs about the need to promote economic efficiency in Canada.  You may be asking why the Bank of Canada, with its well-known responsibility for monetary policy, would put such emphasis on financial system issues. The answer is that the two are tightly linked. We care a great deal about the financial system because a serious disruption in it would affect our ability to conduct monetary policy, and because increasing the efficiency of the financial system can increase the effectiveness of our monetary policy. At the same time, contributing to a stable economy through sound monetary policy helps reduce the risk of instability in the financial system. I'll talk about monetary policy a bit later. But first, I want to look back over the past seven years – in particular, the past seven months – and discuss some of the developments that we have seen in terms of financial system issues. To begin, I will give a brief overview of the Bank's role in the financial system, and review some of the issues I've raised in the past few years. Then, I will discuss the dislocations in financial markets that began during the summer, and talk about how problems related to information contributed to the market turbulence. Finally, I'll look at the effects that these events continue to have, both on financial markets and on the outlook for the Canadian economy. The Bank and the financial system One reason for giving these financial system speeches near year-end is so that they coincide with the publication of the December edition of the Bank's Financial System Review (FSR). The purpose of my previous speeches was the same as the Bank's purpose in publishing the FSR; that is, to improve public understanding of financial system developments and trends, to point out potential vulnerabilities in the system, to highlight some of the Bank's research, and to promote discussion of financial system issues in general. Ultimately, the goal is to help provide the context that will lead to stronger financial system policies in Canada. The latest issue of the FSR was published last week, and it deals extensively with the market turbulence that began during the summer. The Bank actively works to promote a financial system that is both stable and efficient. I've already mentioned that financial instability can impair the Bank's ability to conduct monetary policy. But most importantly, a stable financial system is crucial for an economy to function well. In Canada, the responsibility for promoting financial stability is shared by a number of agencies. Our partners include the Department of Finance, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, and provincial regulators and securities commissions. The Bank is also the ultimate provider of liquidity to facilitate the settlement of financial transactions and is the lender of last resort for financial institutions. BIS Review 147/2007 1 
Despite the importance of financial system efficiency, there is no single body responsible for promoting it. What do I mean when I say "efficiency"? An efficient system is one where scarce economic resources can be allocated to the most productive uses in a cost-effective way. In an efficient financial system, investors can get the highest risk-adjusted returns on their investments, and borrowers can minimize the costs of raising capital. Inefficiencies can stunt investment and cut into economic growth. The Bank of Canada contributes to financial system efficiency through our monetary policy, which keeps inflation low, stable, and predictable. We also have a legislated role to oversee Canada's most important clearing and settlement systems. These systems have been designed to provide certainty that large-value payments or securities transactions will settle in real time, while using relatively small amounts of liquidity. This frees up resources that can be put to better use elsewhere. Over the past four years, I have tried to highlight some important efficiency issues for Canada. In 2004,1 I spoke of the need to promote efficiency in our financial institutions, arguing that our policy framework should provide greater incentives for innovation by encouraging competition while, at the same time, giving our financial institutions the scope to improve efficiency. There remains much work to do to encourage innovation, competition, and efficiency. I also spoke about the need to improve Canada's securities regulation so as to have uniform laws and regulations, based on principles that apply to everyone, but tailored to take into account the differing size and complexity of firms. There has not been as much progress here as I would have hoped. So, Canada remains at risk of seeing its capital markets eroded as business migrates to other financial centres.  I've also talked about the need to improve enforcement in securities markets, because markets work more efficiently when they operate under clear, transparent, and reasonable rules and principles, which are enforced and are seen by all as being enforced. Some progress has been made here, and I welcome the commitment of the RCMP to improve and to implement many of the recommendations set out by Nick Le Pan in his report last week. However, much better co-operation and coordination of efforts among securities commissions, law-enforcement agencies, Crown prosecutors, and ministers of justice and attorneys general is absolutely crucial.  Another efficiency issue I've raised is the need to strengthen Canada's regulatory, legal, and accounting frameworks related to private defined-benefit pensions, so that risks are dealt with in an appropriate way.2 Pension funds can generate important gains in terms of economic efficiency. They help to achieve a more efficient allocation of savings; they are invested by asset managers who have the incentive and the ability to invest across varied asset classes; and, with their very long investment horizons, pension funds can be used to finance long-term investment projects at competitive rates of return. Reviews of pension regulations are under way at both the provincial and federal levels. If we can collectively get these changes right, sponsors would have the appropriate incentives needed to manage risk effectively, thus enhancing the viability of our system of private, voluntary defined-benefit pensions for the good of Canadian workers and firms, and for the benefit of our capital markets. These issues are critical for Canada's future economic prospects. The role of the Bank of Canada has been to do the research and provide the analysis to inform public policy in these areas. I am confident that this work will continue at the Bank in the years ahead. It is up to                                                  1  David Dodge, "Financial System Efficiency: A Canadian Imperative," (Bank of Canada, 2004). 2  David Dodge, "Economic and Financial Efficiency: The Importance of Pension Plans," (Bank of Canada, 2005). 2 BIS Review 147/2007 
the responsible authorities to act on these research findings, and to move these issues forward. At the heart of many of the issues that I've just mentioned are problems related to information. Indeed, one of the key lessons of the past seven months is how information asymmetries can lead to, or exacerbate, disruptions in financial markets. So let me now turn to a discussion of these recent events, and look at how problems with information contributed to the market turbulence. Market dislocations and the role of information To truly understand these events, it's important to have some context. You can find a detailed account of recent events in the December issue of the FSR. The turbulence in financial markets came about against a backdrop of remarkable strength in the global economy. We had seen continuing robust demand for Canadian goods and services that led to a significant improvement in our terms of trade, helping to support the Canadian dollar. Despite this positive backdrop, there were signs of potential trouble in the global economy. As early as 2003, the Bank had flagged concerns about global imbalances.3 The high level of global desired savings relative to desired investment naturally served to drive down real longer-term interest rates, even as central banks around the world were in the process of raising short-term policy rates. With the decline in longer-term interest rates, investors stepped up their demand for riskier assets that would deliver greater returns. This search for yield led to a narrowing of spreads between the yields on risky assets and government bonds. This narrowing of risky spreads became so pronounced and so persistent that many central banks began to question whether they adequately reflected the credit risks that were involved. In fact, the Bank of Canada highlighted this precise concern as far back as our June 2004 issue of the FSR.4 A repricing of risk appeared necessary, but the real question was how, and in what manner, it would take place. Besides the need for a repricing of risk, other factors have contributed to the market turbulence that began this summer. Originators of loans – both bank and non-bank institutions – were increasingly opting to securitize the loans they made in the form of highly structured asset-backed securities, some of which embedded very significant leverage. These were often sold in tranches that provided varying degrees of protection from the default risk involved. Such structures allowed higher-risk assets to appear to take on the qualities of lower-risk assets. The increased use of leveraged structured products was pioneered in major financial centres such as New York and London, although eventually, non-bank institutions began to market these products elsewhere, including here in Canada. The ease with which these highly structured products were sold fuelled the demand for the creation of higher-risk assets, including U.S. subprime-mortgage loans. This, in turn, contributed to the global decline in lending standards. At times, the originators of these loans had fewer incentives to carefully assess the creditworthiness of borrowers. This is because the originators were sometimes distributing all of the loans they had made. In these circumstances, once the loans had been securitized and sold, the originator no longer faced the consequence if the borrower defaulted. I'll return to this point a bit later. But for now, suffice it to say that the decline in standards for loan origination, combined with financial engineering, was helping to spur greater lending.                                                  3  David Dodge, "Past Adjustments and Future Trends in the Canadian Economy," (Bank of Canada, 2003). 4  Bank of Canada: "Financial System Review" (June 2004), p.4. BIS Review 147/2007 3 
The process of securitization is not new. Securities backed by mortgages, credit card receivables, or other types of assets, have been around for years. Indeed, the development of a market for "plain vanilla" asset-backed securities was important since it allowed for the expansion of credit through the market. Initially, this market developed in a reasonably transparent way, in that the nature of, and risks associated with, the underlying assets were clear. Here in Canada, for example, an investor could know with certainty that the mortgages backing securities met the lending standards set by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, or that the loans backing a security were of high enough credit quality that a bank or a retailer was prepared to stake its reputation on the securities. These plain-vanilla asset-backed securities continue to exist and remain an important source of high-quality market-based financing. But more recently, we have seen the emergence of increasingly complex structured products, which were developed in response to the demand for higher returns. And as these securities have become more complex and opaque, in many cases, it has become harder to assemble and understand all the information needed to determine what kinds of assets are backing the security, the quality of those assets, and the counterparty risk involved. A final point here has to do with how these complex securities are valued. Trading of these securities in secondary markets is rare. Thus, prices for these securities are not very transparent. Most of these highly structured securities are valued on a "marked-to-model" basis, meaning that statistical models are used to provide values. But the models typically provide only estimates of values, and these estimates can vary widely if there are changes in the underlying assumptions. Indeed, many of the models assume that the assets backing these securities can be readily traded in a liquid secondary market – an assumption that is clearly not always valid. So it becomes extremely difficult to put a firm value on a particular security at any given time. So, we can now see that many factors made credit markets vulnerable to the recent dislocations. The repricing of risk I mentioned earlier was, in fact, under way before August. By late spring, the spreads on lower-rated corporate bonds had begun to widen to levels closer to historical averages. As we moved into summer, however, we saw rising delinquency rates and higher probabilities of default on U.S. subprime mortgages. And so, there were rising expectations of losses for holders of securities backed by these mortgages. But because of the complexity and opacity of some of these securities, it is extremely difficult for even sophisticated investors to determine, with confidence, both the creditworthiness of the assets backing a particular security and the market value of the security itself. In these circumstances, uncertainty led to contagion and dislocations in money markets more generally, even those markets that have no link to U.S. subprime mortgages. Liquidity, which was recently thought to be too abundant, became scarce. Some investors found that the assets that they assumed were liquid were, in fact, frozen. Investors suddenly became extremely risk averse, leading to a surge in demand for the least-risky assets, such as government bonds and treasury bills. The lack of transparency and problems with information have clearly contributed to the ongoing market turbulence. The global repricing of credit risk is taking longer than many of us initially expected. This is because it is taking more time to unravel some of these complex and opaque instruments to get to the underlying assets, and then to find values for the assets themselves. In addition, uncertainty remains about the extent to which banks are holding these securities, how much they may be required to take onto their balance sheets, and what value to place on them. This uncertainty has exacerbated problems in the global interbank funding market, but because of their strong balance sheets, Canadian banks have been somewhat less affected. Over time, market forces can still be expected to work out these problems. But markets need information to operate efficiently. So, it is in the interest of market participants to make sure that parties have access to all necessary information. 4 BIS Review 147/2007 
Globally, markets for structured asset-backed securities remain under stress. In Canada, the problems have been most acute in the market for structured, non-bank-sponsored, asset-backed commercial paper. The information needed to properly price these products is only now beginning to be made available. With this information, investors and the providers of assets and liquidity are now progressing towards restructuring agreements.  As we go forward, we can expect that investors will demand greater transparency where it is now lacking. Vendors of financial instruments will then need to structure them in such a way that market players can clearly see what they are buying. More fundamentally, investors must take on more responsibility for diligent research, so that they can better understand the nature of their investments. Put another way, investors must demand access to appropriate information so that they can do their own homework, and then they must do that homework. It seems to me that many of these desired outcomes will be accomplished through natural market forces responding to these events. For example, when investors demand much higher rates of return for opaque products, there will be a strong incentive for vendors to provide products that are more transparent. Let me touch briefly on the role of credit-rating agencies in all of this. There is an article in the current FSR that expands on the issues related to the possible reform of the credit-rating process.5 One thing that is clear is that in the future, credit-rating agencies will find it to their advantage to explain more clearly the rationale for, and limitations of, their ratings for highly structured products. There are some natural, self-correcting market forces at work that should lead the rating agencies to improve their processes. Indeed, those credit-rating agencies that do not work harder to improve their processes will likely have fewer clients willing to pay for their services. As I understand it, most agencies are working on such improvements.  But credit-rating agencies are not to blame for the lack of information about those highly structured products that were sold to highly-sophisticated investors in the so-called exempt market. In the retail market, securities regulators impose strict requirements about the information that must be provided through a prospectus or term sheet. But there are no such requirements in the exempt market. It seems to me that some very basic disclosure is needed in every market. And since securities designed for the exempt market are usually required to carry a rating from a credit-rating agency, one way to ensure that appropriate information is available could be to require issuers to publicly disclose the same information that they make available to credit-rating agencies. In this way, investors would have access to the information they need in order to make informed decisions. Another issue that we need to think about is how to get the right incentives in place for loan originators, so that credit quality is maintained and credit can be appropriately priced. I mentioned earlier that, in some cases, the creation of loans largely for immediate securitization reduced the incentive for originators to maintain credit standards. Since the originators were immune from default risk once the loan was completely securitized and sold, they lacked the proper incentives to adequately assess the creditworthiness of the borrower. It may be that natural market forces will go a long way towards rebalancing incentives, but the question can be asked: Are there ways to encourage the more appropriate use of securitization? It may be possible, for example, to have asset-backed securities carry some type of "branding" or "certificate of origination" that would provide a clear incentive for the loan originator to exercise due diligence in extending the loan before it is securitized. Or, we can look for ways to encourage originators to keep a substantial portion of the riskiest tranche of the product they are selling on their own books.                                                   5  Mark Zelmer, "Reforming the Credit-Rating Process."

Implications for monetary policy and the economy Let me now discuss the impact of these recent market dislocations, both on our work at the Bank of Canada, and on the Canadian economy. The impact on the Bank has been two-fold. First, we have undertaken open-market buyback operations and made sure that Canadian banks have had access to our Standing Liquidity Facility, so that they have been able to deal with any overnight liquidity difficulties. This is a normal role for any central bank, and it will continue. But, in the wake of recent events, we are currently looking at whether some types of liquidity disruptions in Canada might be better addressed if the Bank of Canada had a facility that would provide liquidity at terms longer than overnight. We are also examining changes necessary to allow the Bank to accept a wider range of securities for our buyback operations. The Bank's other role, of course, is to conduct monetary policy with the aim of delivering low, stable, and predictable inflation. We have been working to ensure that the financial system has the proper amount of liquidity so that the overnight interest rate – our key policy rate – remains close to target. But what we have seen since this summer is a widening of the spread between short-term market interest rates, such as the rate for commercial paper, and our target for the overnight rate. This is important, because these short-term market rates are a crucial link in the way monetary policy is transmitted: from our key policy rate, to the cost of credit, to spending, production, employment and, ultimately, to the rate of inflation.  These wider spreads have persisted, and they represent a tightening of credit conditions in Canada. These tighter credit conditions have come as financial market difficulties have intensified over the past few weeks and as bank funding costs have increased globally. At the same time, there is an increased risk attached to the prospects for demand for Canadian exports because the outlook for the U.S. economy – particularly the U.S. housing sector – has weakened. Uncertainty related to all of these factors has led to exceptional volatility in financial and currency markets globally. While there remain upside risks to inflation in Canada, all factors considered, the Bank judges that there has been a shift to the downside in the balance of risks around our October projection for inflation. In light of this shift, we lowered the target for the overnight rate last week. Before our next interest rate decision in January, we will assess all economic and financial developments and the balance of risks, and do a full projection for the economy and inflation. Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, as you know I will be stepping down as Governor of the Bank at the end of January, and concluding more than thirty-five years of involvement in economic policy within the public service. Since this is my last public speech as Governor, I thought it might be apt to conclude my remarks today with three of the most important lessons for economic policy that I – and I believe many Canadians – have learned over the past thirty-five years. The first lesson is that both individuals and firms must always be prepared to adjust quickly to changing global economic circumstances. The world will evolve in ways that we cannot predict, so we must be prepared to deal with change and seize new opportunities as they arise. Perhaps even more importantly, we should not cling to activities that are no longer economically justified, however difficult and painful adjustment may be. Not adjusting is not an option. In the end, rapid adjustment is less painful than prolonging activities where we no longer hold a comparative advantage. This is the lesson that I and many other Canadians learned from our difficulties in the 1970s and the early 1980s. Second, we have all learned the importance of achieving and maintaining sustainable levels of public debt. Canadians paid a very real price in the 1990s to control the growth of public debt, and have wisely used the favourable conditions of the past decade to bring down the ratio of public debt to GDP. Although conditions will not necessarily be as favourable over the 6 BIS Review 147/2007 
next decade as they have been recently, nonetheless, further efforts to reduce the debt-service burden are needed in order to prepare for the inevitable effects of the aging of our population. Third, we have all learned that the most important contribution a central bank can make to economic welfare is to maintain confidence in the future value of money. In the 1970s, we all witnessed the economic and social instability caused by high and volatile inflation. In the 1980s, we paid the price of recession to get inflation under control. Since the early 1990s, our inflation-targeting regime has kept inflation low, stable, and predictable at 2 per cent. This, together with fiscal consolidation, has helped to keep growth more steady, employment to rise to historically high levels, and unemployment to fall to levels not seen for decades. My colleagues at the Bank will continue to search for technical improvements in our inflation-targeting regime, but I am confident that the Bank and my successor, Mark Carney, will continue to keep inflation low, stable, and predictable, for the benefit of all Canadians. Finally, let me close by saying that it has been an enormous privilege for me to be able to serve Canadians for three and a half decades. I am grateful for having had that opportunity, and I am hopeful that, in some way, my efforts over the years may encourage others to follow in the service of Canada and its people.

Stanley Fischer: Tomorrow’s economic agenda Address by Professor Stanley Fischer, Governor of the Bank of Israel, to the Israel Business Conference, Tel Aviv, 10 December 2007. *      *      * The announcement in the newspapers about the Israel Business Conference bears the slogan “Come and join us, so that you’ll be part of tomorrow’s economic agenda”. And that is what I would like to talk about today, “Tomorrow’s economic agenda.” The objective of such an agenda should be rapid and sustained growth, the benefits of which would be enjoyed by the whole population. Such growth is critical for the future of the economy, the future of the society, and the future of the country. The reason is simple, and is like the effect of compound interest: if, for example, we manage to grow during the next 25 years at an average rate of 6 percent a year, in the year 2032 Israel’s GDP will reach NIS 2,830 billion (at 2007 prices), compared with about NIS 660 billion in 2007. If on the other hand the economy grows at only 3 percent a year over the same period, GDP will reach NIS 1,380 billion. That is a huge difference of more than 100 percent, and proves what my late friend Professor Herbert Stein used to say: “The difference between 3 percent growth and 6 percent growth is 100 percent.” If we succeed in traveling along the path of rapid, sustained growth, we will have the means available to deal with the various problems confronting us – in the fields of education, the economy, the social fabric, security, etc. Failure to do so will cost the country and society dearly. Today I will speak about two important aspects of growth: (1) the fact that actual economic growth permeates the whole population; (2) the need to maintain fiscal discipline. 1 Actual economic growth permeates the whole population Growth of more than 5 percent a year, which the economy has been enjoying since 2003, significantly improves the standard of living of the whole population. a) In 2006 the rate of poverty, based on the relative measure that relates mainly to income differentials, stopped rising. Moreover, if we use the absolute measure of poverty, i.e., the ability to purchase a basket of basic goods, the rate of poverty actually declined in 2005 as well as in 2006.  b) The decline in unemployment since 2003 can be seen at all educational levels, including the lowest.  c) The increased rate of participation in the labor market is evident in all parts of the country, including outlying areas (the northern and southern districts). d) The rate of employment of Israelis is rising in all industries, including the low-technology ones (such as construction, agriculture, hotels and catering, and electricity and water). e) The average real wage is rising in all industries, including the low-technology industries.  What conclusion do we draw from this? It’s very simple: the longer we stick to the path of rapid growth, the more people will be absorbed in the labor market, and the standard of living of all segments of the population will rise. Hence the importance of rapid and continuous growth to the economy, society, and the country, as everyone enjoys its benefits. BIS Review 147/2007 1 
2 The need to maintain fiscal discipline In order to achieve rapid and continuous growth, the government’s strategy – which enables the economy to continue to grow and economic and financial stability to be maintained – must be adhered to. The essence of this strategy is fiscal discipline, alongside the Bank of Israel’s interest rate policy, and the continued process of structural reforms in areas that promote growth and improve the country’s social fabric. One such area, possibly the most important, is without doubt education; hence the vital importance of a comprehensive reform in this field. I turn now to fiscal discipline. In order to escape from the recession that gripped the economy in the early 2000s, the government adopted a fiscal strategy aimed at reducing both the share of its expenditure in GDP, which had reached 52 percent, and also the budget deficit. There were two good reasons for doing so: the need to free resources for the private sector, which is the main source of growth, and the need to reduce the debt burden, which in 2003 had reached 102 percent of GDP and was threatening to undermine economic stability. The situation was so serious that we had to obtain US government guarantees so that we could borrow on the international markets. As a result of that policy, and with the extra advantage of global economic growth, since mid-2003 the economy has been growing at an impressive pace of more than 5 percent a year, the debt burden has been reduced to 82 percent of GDP, the government’s interest payments on its debt fell by more than NIS 10 billion, the government’s share of GDP has fallen to below 45 percent, exports are expanding swiftly, the current account of the balance of payments is showing a surplus of more than 5 percent of GDP, the unemployment rate has dropped by about 4 percentage points, the rate of poverty is declining (based on the absolute measure), and so are tax rates. This is a huge success, which must be protected. At present, when uncertainty about global growth has risen, it is even more important for Israel to maintain fiscal discipline. What is the government’s fiscal strategy? It set a rigid framework of discipline based on budget targets for its expenditure and the budget deficit, and it makes sure that it adheres to them. This greatly enhanced its credibility in the eyes of investors and in the domestic and international financial markets. The high level of the government’s credibility, combined with the success of its policy, led to the reduction of Israel’s sovereign risk premium, the improvement of its credit rating, the OECD decision to invite Israel to start the process of joining the organization, and the agreement of the US government to extend the guarantees. The result of the above is that the government and the business sector can borrow at reasonable cost. Thus, yields to maturity on indexed government bonds have fallen from about 5 percent in 2003 to about 3 percent today. Households, too, pay lower interest on their loans. For example, indexed interests on mortgages have fallen from an average of about 6 percent in 2003 to an average of about 4 percent currently. Now, just prior to the approval of the 2008 budget by the Knesset, and just after the government set its budget targets for next year, proposals are being made to abandon those targets. It would be very dangerous to accept these proposals. Abandoning the targets set by the government itself is likely to severely undermine its credibility, and will cancel much of the progress that has been made. Just now, when uncertainty about continued global growth has increased, we must not go back on our undertakings. I support the efforts of the Minister of Finance, with the backing of the Prime Minister, to ensure that the framework of the budget for 2008, based on the expenditure and deficit targets set by the government, will soon receive Knesset approval. These efforts were certainly an important consideration that led to Israel’s recently improved credit rating, and we should help the Minister and the government as much as we can to make sure that their undertaking is implemented. 2 BIS Review 147/2007 
The responsible way to increase expenditure on certain items is to alter the order of priorities in the budget, within the framework of the targets that have been set, and to implement them in conjunction with reforms that would boost efficiency. The budget for 2008 already reflects changed priorities, with increased expenditure on defense and education. It is obvious that education is one of the most important subjects, for the future of the economy, the society, and the country. Human capital is Israel’s main natural resource. It is therefore vital to invest in education and promote the reform that will raise the level of youngsters’ achievements, while remaining within the budget framework. Maintaining the budget framework, and growth-inducing reforms such as the education reform constitute a very important contribution by the government to the achievement of the goal of tomorrow’s economic agenda – rapid and sustained growth which benefits the entire population. Such growth is critical for the future of the economy, society, and the country. BIS Review 147/2007 3 
Lorenzo Bini Smaghi: Banking consolidation, innovation and access to credit Speech by Mr Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at CESIFIN, Florence, 11 December 2007. *      *      * 1.  Introduction1Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for inviting me to take part in this conference, which is covering a very important topic, not only at European but also at local level.  As you know, the financial industry is going through an unprecedented period of consolidation. Fundamental changes in regulation and technology have spurred a record number of bank mergers and acquisitions (M&As) in most countries. Very recently, we have even witnessed a significant series of cross-border M&As in the banking sector, especially in Europe.  This consolidation has not only brought about major changes in the banking industry, but also had important consequences for the economy as a whole. In my speech today, I would like to talk about the implications of these developments for the financing conditions of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).  After briefly describing the consolidation process, I will consider its impact on: i) the banking system as a whole, ii) shareholder value, iii) credit to SMEs, and iv) small banks. Moreover, I will offer some thoughts on the possible implications of the current credit turmoil. 2.  Banking consolidation Let me start with an overview of the banking consolidation that we are currently experiencing. In the last ten years, the number of banks in Europe (to be precise, in the 15 EU countries prior to 2004) has decreased by almost 30%, while at the same time the total assets held by the banking system has increased by more than 100%.2 This process implies that the average bank size in terms of total assets has risen significantly, from €1.8 billion to more than €5 billion, an increase of approximately 200%.  In Italy, banking consolidation has not been as strong as in the other 14 countries: the number of banks has fallen by only 10%, banks’ total assets have increased by 75% and the average bank size has increased by 100%.  Bank mergers and acquisitions are the main path to bank consolidation. This activity has been buoyant in Europe, judging from the number of deals and the volume, and also in terms of cross-border transactions.3 Over 800 M&As have taken place in the past ten years, and their total value is put at €500 billion. Italy alone has seen 200 such deals, with a total value of €100 billion. All in all, the push towards consolidation in the banking sector has been substantial.                                                   1  The views expressed reflect only those of the author. I thank J.-L. Peydró-Alcalde for his input into the preparation of these remarks. 2  ECB calculations. 3  ECB calculations. BIS Review 147/2007 1 
There has also been a large number of cross-border M&As in recent years: over 100 in just the past two years in Europe. In the last three years, the average value per transaction has increased significantly, even without considering exceptional cases such as the acquisition of ABN Ambro by RBS, Santander and Fortis. In Italy, by contrast, cross-border deals have been few and of limited average value, both in comparison with other European countries as well as with domestic M&As.  The main reasons for this unprecedented wave of consolidation in the financial sector are common to most countries. In response to fundamental changes in regulation and technology, financial institutions have attempted to improve their efficiency and attract new customers by expanding internationally and adding to their range of products. The desire to preserve falling margins by increasing market share and attracting new customers is often fulfilled by way of M&As, since they allow financial institutions to grow rapidly and to improve their knowledge of new products and markets.4  By achieving economies of scale and scope, mergers can make banks more efficient5, not least by eliminating poor management, and might also help financial institutions to better diversify their portfolios.  3.  Effects on the banking system There are several ways in which bank M&As can improve efficiency.6 First, bigger banks may gain access to cost-saving technologies or spread their fixed costs over a larger base, thus reducing average costs. Efficiency gains may also result from economies of scope: the deal may allow the merging parties to enter new markets and cross-sell their products to a wider customer base. Finally, consolidation may improve managerial efficiency. However, the extent of exploitable scale and scope economies might be smaller than commonly thought, and efficiency gains resulting from better management might be elusive in large, complex institutions. The direct costs arising from M&As can take several forms: consolidating different organisations is not an easy task and may lead to inefficiencies.  There are also external costs. These can take several forms. First, for some financial products (in particular, deposits and small business lending) markets are mainly local. Therefore, M&As involving banks with large market shares might cause adverse price changes, harming consumers. Second, M&As might distract some participants from small business lending, which relies on soft information at local level, to less custom-made products that are more easily manageable within large organisations, as I will elaborate on a little later. Third, depending on the type of business and geography, bank M&As could harm bank customers by reducing competition.  Therefore, since bank M&As affect not only banks themselves but also their customers, quantifying the efficiency gains becomes difficult. An important first step towards analysing some potential externalities to the bank customers is to assess the value created for bank shareholders and depositors. This is what I am going to do now. Later on, I will analyse the impact of bank M&As on the financing of small firms and on entrepreneurship.                                                  4  Focarelli, Panetta, and Salleo (2002). 5  Jensen and Ruback (1983). 6  See Amel, Barnes, Panetta and Salleo (2004). 2 BIS Review 147/2007 
4.  Creating value for shareholders The main message from the academic literature is that banking consolidation is beneficial up to a relatively small size, but there is little evidence that mergers yield economies of scope or gains in managerial efficiency.7 However, value creation from bank mergers and acquisitions has improved over time, possibly because such activities are complex and because lessons have been learnt.8  Moreover, most of the estimated value gains from bank mergers stem from cutting costs by eliminating overlaps and consolidating backroom operations.9 In addition, mergers that focus both on activity and geography enhance shareholder value.10  With respect to risk, there is evidence that M&As reduce bank risk. The evidence indicates that the primary determinants in bank risk reduction comes from diversification gains, gains associated with achieving too-big-to-fail status, and, to a lesser degree, synergy gains.11  5.  Implications of mergers and acquisitions for small and medium-sized enterprises  Now let me turn to some of the social benefits and costs stemming from banking consolidation, in particular with respect to the financing of small firms and entrepreneurship. Banking consolidation through bank M&As implies a reduction in the number of banks and an increase in bank size. This can have repercussions on the access to credit for small and new firms since bank M&As change bank efficiency and competition, but it also changes the way banks evaluate corporate borrowers: it decreases soft vs. hard information for lending decisions, i.e. bank M&As might distract some participants from small business lending, which relies on soft information at local level. The academic results based on US data suggest that small business lending increases following a merger of small banks, but decreases when large banks combine. Therefore, in the short run it looks as if small businesses are hurt by large bank mergers. This negative effect, however, can partly be offset by lending from other banks in the same market, especially after some years. That is, provided the banking system is competitive, so that when the new and bigger post-merger bank starts cutting its lending to small firms, other banks in the system will step in and start lending to those companies.12  As a consequence, in terms of lending volume to small businesses, bank M&As do not seem harmful in the medium term. However, it could be the case that other lending standards become tougher – especially loan spreads – after a merger. The empirical evidence suggests that there is a reduction in spreads if the acquirer and the target bank have some market overlap and, consequently, more potential for cost savings. However, spreads widen when there is significant market overlap and, therefore, increased market power post merger.13  In fact, when we look at megabank mergers in the US, empirical evidence suggests that this type of merger implies shareholder value creation for the banks involved but losses for loan                                                  7  See e.g. Houston, Ryngaert (1994), Piloff (1996), Berger et al. (1999). 8  DeLong and DeYoung (2004). 9  Houston, James, Ryngaert (2001). 10  DeLong (2001). 11  Penas and Unal (2004). 12  Berger, Saunders, Scalise, and Udell (1998).

customers, especially if they are small and credit-constrained, or if the acquisition is an in-market deal.14 All in all, the impact of bank M&As on lending to small firms depends on whether the reason for the merger was to increase market power or to reduce costs and, therefore, improve efficiency. These conclusions appear to be even more robust when we also analyse the European experience since, on this side of the Atlantic, banks play a special role in the financing of many firms.15 Let me now consider some evidence from European countries.  The evidence is similar to the studies done with US data, and sometimes the evidence is even stronger, since in Europe banks are the key source of finance for many firms.16 For instance, Italian data show that bank M&As have an adverse effect on credit, especially if an M&A is followed by the termination of a business relationship. The effect lasts for three years and by the end of that period it has been absorbed, suggesting that firms are able to compensate for the negative shock.17 In addition, also based on Italian data, contract interest rates on bank loans fall when banks with small shares in the local banking market combine. The opposite result is observed for mergers between large banks.18  Based on evidence from some countries, relationship customers of the target bank are more likely than acquirer customers to have their relationships terminated with their bank. These effects are more pronounced for smaller customers with no alternate lending relationships.19 Furthermore, mergers reduce the equity value of small publicly traded firms that are customers of the target bank and the reduction in value increases with the size of the target bank.20  6.  Role of small banks All in all, the evidence from Europe is very similar to that of the US. If small businesses tend to suffer from bank M&As, especially when the banks involved are not small, then it seems that there is a role for small banks. The key characteristic of lending to SMEs is the “softness” of the information generated in the decision-making compared with large banks that rely more on “hard” information. Hard information is based on accounting data and not on personal knowledge and repeated interaction between lender and borrower.21 Because soft information is important for lending to small businesses, the supply of credit to small firms may be negatively affected by M&A activity because the resulting larger banks show a preference for transaction-based lending over relationship-based lending.  In fact, evidence suggests that small banks use soft information for lending and are, therefore, key for SME lending.22 Moreover, as I said earlier, M&As between small banks increase bank efficiency and lending to SMEs. Small banks also lend to riskier firms, which generally are SMEs.23                                                 14  See Carow et al. (2006). 15  See ECB (2007). 16  See ECB (2007). 17  Bonaccorsi Di Patti, and Gobbi (2007). 18  Sapienza (2002). 19  Degryse, Masschelein, and Mitchell (2005). See also Sapienza (2002). 20  Karceski, Ongena, and Smith (2005). 21  Stein (2002). 22  Berger, Miller, Petersen, Rajan, and Stein (2005). 23  Jiménez, Ongena, Peydró-Alcalde and Saurina (2007). 4 BIS Review 147/2007 
We have seen that after an M&A deal a bank is less likely to extend credit to small businesses. Therefore, it could be especially difficult for those firms with almost no credit history (e.g., start-ups) to obtain credit, especially after M&As between large banks. Empirical evidence suggests that bank consolidation slows down the rate of new business formation and that it is primarily driven by large bank acquirers. Consolidations between small or medium-sized banks show a positive impact on new business development. But in any case these effects are only short-term.24  As a result, the effects of bank M&As on new firms resemble those on the financing of small firms. 7.  Outlook I would now like to touch upon developments in the current period of financial turbulence and offer some comment on its potential impact on consolidation and firms’ access to credit. Obviously, it is very difficult at this stage to predict developments and I shall refrain from doing so, but I shall nevertheless try to draw some conclusions. The sub-prime mortgage crisis could give rise to three types of scenario. First, it would seem likely that for a certain period of time securitisation will decline. The valuation of these operations, which have a multiplier effect for banks and allow for credit to be used more efficiently, has proved difficult, even for rating agencies. There will be a tendency for both the rating agencies and the banks themselves to review valuation models of illiquid assets in general. Furthermore, financial intermediaries – in particular banks – will need to overhaul their liquidity management practices. The strong demand for liquidity which we are currently witnessing, and which continues to prompt banks to obtain funds directly from the monetary authorities rather than from the interbank market, demonstrates that the risk of not being able to liquidate assets quickly and at low cost on the market has been underestimated. A return to normal conditions in the markets, hopefully in the New Year, will require some re-thinking by financial institutions of their valuation models as well as their dependence, for their liquidity management requirements, on other counterparties which could experience the same kinds of difficulty. Thirdly, some financial intermediaries may need to increase capital so as to absorb potential losses or to refinance investment vehicles which until now were off-balance-sheet items, and which, with Basel II as from next year, should appear on the balance sheet. What impact will these developments have on banking consolidation?  On the one hand, banks could focus on themselves over the next few months and aim to review their internal organisation, improve their balance sheets and restructure. There could then be a pause in the consolidation process. Furthermore, the more restrictive financing conditions could discourage mergers and acquisitions, which are often financed over the short term by bank loans. On the other hand, one way of reinforcing the solidity of the assets side of the balance sheet could be to proceed with either mergers or acquisitions. Recently, we have witnessed a strengthening of the capital of some large banks with the emergence of new shareholders, in particular foreign shareholders. The emergence of large sovereign funds in countries where the financial system needs to be strengthened is an interesting development for the international financial system, even if it raises a number of questions in terms of transparency, objectives and stability.                                                  24  See Francis, Hasan and Wang (2007) and Black and Strahan (2002). BIS Review 147/2007 5 
Overall, the process of concentration may continue over the next few months and affect some of the major financial institutions. Recent developments have also shown that the process of concentration is not necessarily all in one direction, i.e. consolidation. In particular, we have seen the break-up of one large European institution, which had perhaps grown disproportionately large. The need to strengthen the asset base of some banks could lead to the downsizing or elimination of some business lines, thereby creating opportunities for other institutions. What are the effects of these trends on credit to non-financial firms, in particular on small and medium-sized companies? On the one hand, the need for the restructuring and strengthening of assets, beyond the drying-up of securitisation, could lead to a slowdown in lending by the banks, particularly those more affected by the recent turbulence. On the other hand, maintaining the profitability of the banks could lead to a reinforcement of the relationship with their own clients, particularly the high-quality ones in terms of balance-sheet profitability and transparency. From this point of view, credit to small and medium-sized companies, which is less standardised, could suffer.  However, if some banks cease to pursue certain types of activity, in particular larger banks which have more options with regard to the reorganisation of their activities, the current turmoil could create opportunities for competitors to enter new markets in search of new customers. Consequently, the level of bank competition could increase considerably in the coming months and this could benefit the end customer.  It is still too early to predict which of these effects will prevail in the coming months. The situation differs greatly across countries, sectors and institutions. The most recent data on credit conditions indicate a further increase in the cost of financing for non-financial corporations, particularly for debt instruments, i.e. excluding financing through the stock market. Although the overnight rate remained practically unchanged between June and September 2007, short-term bank interest rates on loans to corporations increased by around half a percentage point in the euro area, and by a similar amount in Italy. As regards long term interest rates, market rates fell by around half a percentage point between June and September, but long-term rates on bank loans increased by 15 to 30 basis points. The Bank Lending Survey published by the European Central Bank at the end of September indicates that conditions for credit to corporations have become more restrictive as a result of the market turbulence. This tightening seems to have been more pronounced for larger corporations, and this is in line with the evidence available for the United States and the United Kingdom. Nevertheless, the fact that the cost of bank financing has increased more than total financing costs, which also include market financing, might suggest that credit conditions have become on the whole less favourable for corporations that are more dependent on bank credit, in particular small and medium-sized corporations. As regards the reasons for differing attitudes among banks with respect to credit activity, the Bank Lending Survey provides evidence of a certain reappraisal of expectations regarding growth, both in general and at sectoral level, as well as the cost and availability of financing for banks, which are at the heart of the current market tensions. Indeed, in response to a question added to the latest version of the survey, banks reported a perceptible worsening of their own financing conditions, not only with regard to the interbank market but also to all debt instruments and all maturities.  Despite the less favourable supply conditions, demand for credit and credit actually granted remained very dynamic into the third quarter of 2007, not only in the euro area as a whole but also in Italy. This suggests that, overall, it cannot be concluded that a credit squeeze is currently occurring in the euro area. Credit supply conditions remain more favourable than in previous surveys. This does not rule out less favourable developments ahead, in line with the intentions recorded in surveys.  6 BIS Review 147/2007 
These considerations suggest that caution is needed when assessing future developments. Too often in the past, hurried forecasts have been proved wrong in one way or another. Therefore, it is important to closely monitor the underlying market conditions by asking financial institutions to clarify, as soon as possible, not only their current balance sheet positions but also their future strategies, in particular with regard to their relations with customers.

David Dodge: Economic outlook and recent developments in Canada Opening statement by Mr David Dodge, Governor of the Bank of Canada, to the Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce, Ottawa, 6 December 2007. *      *      * Good morning, Mr. Chairman and committee members. Let me start by saying how much I have appreciated our semi-annual meetings with this committee over the past seven years. The discussions that Paul and I have had with you have been very valuable for the Bank of Canada. I hope that you have found them equally useful and that these regular appearances will continue long after I have left the Bank. Today's meeting comes just a couple of hours after we published the latest edition of our Financial System Review. But it has been quite some time since we issued our October Monetary Policy Report. Nevertheless, I want to begin with the economic outlook as we saw it in October. I will then talk about developments since that time and our current assessment of the risks to the outlook. The Bank's outlook from October is summarized in Tables 1 to 3 of the Monetary Policy Report. In October, we saw strong global economic growth continuing in 2008 and 2009, although we foresaw considerably weaker U.S. growth in 2008 than had previously been the case. The global outlook is summarized in Table 1. In Canada, we were looking for weaker economic growth in the fourth quarter of this year and the first half of 2008, but some strengthening thereafter. As you can see from Table 2, we were expecting continued strong final domestic demand throughout the projection period, but considerably weaker net exports. This outlook reflected weaker U.S. growth and a stronger Canadian dollar, which was assumed to average 98 cents U.S. over the projection period. Inflation was expected to peak in the fourth quarter of this year before returning to the 2 per cent target around the middle of 2008, as you can see from Table 3. Against this background, we left the target for the overnight rate unchanged at 4 1/2 per cent on 16 October, and judged the risks to our outlook to be roughly balanced with perhaps a slight tilt to the downside. Now, let me turn to developments since October. The Canadian economy continues to operate above its production capacity. Given the strength of domestic demand and weak productivity growth, there continue to be upside risks to the Bank's inflation projection. However, other developments since October suggest that the downside risks to the Bank's inflation projection have increased. Difficulties in global financial markets, related to the valuation of structured products and anticipated losses on U.S. subprime mortgages, have worsened since mid-October. These difficulties are expected to persist for a longer period of time than previously thought. In these circumstances, bank funding costs have increased globally and in Canada, and credit conditions have tightened further. There is an increased risk to the prospects for demand for Canadian exports since the outlook for the U.S. economy – particularly, the U.S. housing sector – has weakened.  All these factors considered, the Bank judges that there has been a shift to the downside in the balance of risks around its October projection for inflation through 2009. In light of this shift, the Bank decided to lower the target for the overnight rate at our fixed announcement date on Tuesday. At our next interest rate decision in January, we will assess all economic and financial developments and the balance of risks, and have a full updated projection for the economy and inflation in the Monetary Policy Report Update, to be published on 24 January 2008. Mr. Chairman, Paul and I will now be happy to answer your questions.  BIS Review 146/2007 1

Shamshad Akhtar: Islamic finance – growth, competitiveness and sustainability Speech by Dr Shamshad Akhtar, Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, at the 14th: World Islamic Banking Conference, Bahrain, 9-10 December 2007. *      *      * 1. Islamic finance has received overwhelming response from across the world as one discovers its ideological and practical richness and relevance. Growth in Islamic finance industry has however triggered a number of debates regarding the challenges this industry faces. These debates essentially revolve around whether Islamic finance is progressing well and is it there to stay? Is Islamic finance going to be a niche market or does it have global appeal? What are key drivers for enhancing the efficiency and competitiveness of Islamic finance industry which would in turn help broaden its appeal and in turn enhance its sustainability? In my brief remarks I will touch on these debates. 2. Despite transitory challenges – typical of a new and emerging industry, my view is that prospects for growth of Islamic finance are promising but rests on building an effective system for Islamic finance.1 Growing interest has led to rising investments in Islamic finance and resulted in phenomenal growth in Islamic finance businesses. Interest in this discipline has already extended beyond Muslim and Islamic countries to non-Muslim population and jurisdictions and non-Islamic financial institutions. The avoidance of forbidden investments (“haram” products) and interest rates and speculative structures prohibited in Islamic jurisprudence and Islamic finance’s emphasis on just and equitable financial system offers distinct appeal for Muslims to be attracted to this option. Appeal of Shariah compliant financing mechanism is also likely to be a powerful tool for enhancing access to development finance and empowering the poor and vulnerable groups, particularly if Islamic banks extend their reach in rural areas which are currently not effectively served by conventional system.  3. Irrespective of religious appeal and affiliations, consumers would be eventually attracted to Islamic finance if it positions itself to offer an efficient and competitive alternate avenue of financial intermediation which caters to all segments of population and economy and services retail and personal banking and project finance. This can happen only if key messages and principles of Islamic finance are flexibly, constructively and innovatively interpreted, its conceptual framework further developed, nurtured and translated effectively into practical applications, and work is launched to better develop interface and linkages between Islamic and conventional finance and unleash the synergies to advantage of global financial development.  Drivers for enhancing efficiency and competitiveness 4. Few key drivers for enhancing efficiency and competitiveness of Islamic Finance include: (i) Financial engineering and innovation. (ii) Global financial centers and their regulators support for Islamic finance industry. (iii) Standard governance and prudential regulation and supervisory guidance which require tweaking regulations to properly identify and assign proper weights for new                                                  1  “Building an effective Islamic financial system.” Dr. Shamshad Akhtar, Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, at the Global Islamic Financial Governor’s: Financial Regulators Forum in Islamic Finance, Kuala Lumpur, 27 March 2007. BIS Review 146/2007 1 
and different types of risks associated with the special and unique characteristic of Islamic finance business. (iv) Development and adoption of simple and standard and cost effective legal frameworks for contracts associated with the new and hybrid products. (v) Flexible and practical application and enforcement of Shariah principles and injunctions and its acceptability by public.  5. Taking up these items, first it has to be emphasized that financial engineering and innovation is one of the most potent tools of Islamic finance and will be the key driver to attracting global economic and financial player’s interest which will be critical for competitiveness and sustainability of Islamic finance. Increasingly Scholars, academics and practitioners have worked with global banks to offer wide range of wholesale, retail and trade financing banking solutions. For instance: (i) Vanilla Sukuks are now being compliment by range of hybrid Sukuks: Sukuk –Ijara, Sukuk-Musharaka, Sukuk-Moharba and so and so forth – as per IMF recent study there are today over twenty odd different variants of Sukuk.  (ii) Islamic derivative market now offers Islamic equivalent of interest rate swap/option called profit rate swap/option and Islamic cross currency and FX swap and options. This is appreciable development given that Shariah compliant transaction has to fulfill existence of underlying real assets and generally it does not approve of uncertainty (jahala) and speculation or undue risk taking (Gharar).  (iii) Private equity has already structural compatibility with Islamic financing, although it has to be deployed for Shariah eligible uses. (iv) Personal banking solutions are now being floated saving and investment account and information technology is used to offer online, ATMs and telephone banking services.  (v) By and large products are structured on murabaha principles where funds are allocated for particular projects or finance an asset (such as home ownership and automobiles) in which depositor shares in the project rather than bank profits and to structure ijara (leasing) with appropriate asset backing and legal structures.  (vi) In some cases there is move into bancassurance through establishment of associated Takaful institution and appending insurance sweetener is also a wave, though slow to take off. 6. There is scope for deepening financial engineering and innovation and exploiting its edge to promote equity based financing or structure hybrid debt: equity instruments. This will allow Islamic banks to offer richer and multiple options to customer, while allowing banks opportunities for proper fund mobilization and asset diversification. It will allow avenues for proper diversification and integration of financial services and pooling of risks through blending of Islamic and conventional financing to epitomize risk sharing between stakeholders and align rewards to be consistent with the risks.  7. Second driving factor would be global financial centers and their regulators support for Islamic finance industry. Currently wave of interest in Islamic finance is fascinating and has helped attract global banks in Asia and Europe to use their skills to augment the application of Islamic finance principles. As expected the approach and level of enthusiasm and pro-activism has varied in Western world. I would like to highlight the emerging approach of United Kingdom which has set on course a conducive and practical approach for development of Islamic finance which I would advocate other developed 2 BIS Review 146/2007 
jurisdictions can pursue. U.K aims to strike a balance whereby FSA’s recent paper2 highlighted that it has adopted “no obstacle and no favors” policy for Islamic finance. Recognizing its secular framework, U.K has been upfront, practical and candid requiring financial institutions to find mechanisms for conforming to FSA basic regulatory framework, while being open to be accommodative in interpretation of its rules and regulations. To conform to FSA requirements, Islamic financial institutions have to ensure structures evolved are in compliance with FSA requirements. Meanwhile, U.K provides the necessary flexibility and the required relief to its regulation on case to case basis. Equally supportive has been U.K rationalization of multiple taxes applicable in purchase and sale of properties to facilitate Sukuks and Islamic mortgages.  8. Third critical driver of Islamic finance is the efforts being launched by central banks to reach understanding on banking regulation and supervision. Broad understanding has now evolved that financial institution have to conform to standard financial regulation and supervision requirements applicable to conventional banks. There has been steady progress to improvise and modify regulatory framework to recognize the safeguards required for risks associated with Islamic banking solution and the required capital treatment for special and unique characteristics of Islamic finance business. The differences in the assets and liability structure in Islamic finance and the complexities associated with different Islamic products, however, tend to alter the risk perception associated with this financial system.  9. As such, work of IFSB and industry continues to be critical to evolve better understanding of different risks and how to cushion for such risks. Ensuring harmonization and consistent adoption, application and implementation of these evolving standards for Islamic finance and products will be a challenge but absolutely required to avoid regulatory arbitrage by industry and certain Islamic jurisdictions. Potential for such distortions will be inevitable as Islamic prudential regulatory and capital adequacy standards require more guidance and awareness. Furthermore, in line with the spirit of Bank International Settlement subscribed regulatory standards, IFSB standards are also for voluntary, rather than compulsory compliance. While this would result in differences in timing of adoption of such standards by Islamic industry, it is expected that with growing awareness market and investors will be factoring in differences in compliance in their choice of institutions.  10. Fourth critical driver of Islamic finance would be development and adoption of simple and standard legal frameworks. Contracts are at the core of Islamic transactions which define the rules for sale and purchase/trade/exchange of goods and services. Contracts are structured around the nature of transaction which could be either in the form of trade financing; asset based financing or different forms of partnerships. Under Islamic finance preference is given to trading of physical assets as well as trading of rights and with the growing hybrid products the demands for legal documentation has multiplied and is adding to the cost of transaction. Certainty of contract is another important element under Islamic contract law. The body of Islamic Contract Law while rich and supportive of participant’s right in transaction is onerous, complex and prone to different interpretations and rulings. Equally challenging are questions of enforceability of terms and conditions and lack of ability of courts to arbitrate litigation in case of dispute on contracts.  11. Fifth, it has to be recognized that Islamic finance is in its evolutionary stage and its sustainability would depend critically on regulators work with Islamic Scholars to reach flexible and shared, if not unified, understandings on principle elements at international level, despite differences in faiths and disciplines. There are number of faiths and disciplines across Muslim jurisdictions (for e.g. Syria and Pakistan are                                                  2  Financial Services Authority: Islamic Finance in the UK: Regulation and Challenges.

predominantly Hanafi school, Bahrain, Dubai and Abu Dhabi pursues Maliki school, Saudi Arabia and Qatar relies on Hanbali school). Rather than pursue harmonized views, each faith developing its own applications adds to the cost of transaction, introduces doubts on viability of Islamic finance given the split opinions, and confuses the public that basically relies on Scholars endorsement of products and business. These differences along with different interpretations of Shariah Scholars at the Boards or as advisors within the banks, if significant, further carry the risk of Sharia arbitrage which carries complications for regulators. Reaching consensus and shared/harmonized guidance among Scholars of different beliefs and faiths and evolving more unified institutional mechanism for adoption of common Shariah standards and ensuring proper enforcement through effective internal controls for their compliance would let the industry grow and compete on level playing field. Flexible and simpler interpretation of the basic tenets at the level of Scholars would enhance public acceptability.  12. Finally, keeping these macro considerations aside, Islamic banks being late starters do face a real challenge of competing with a well established conventional industry. Furthermore, full-fledged Islamic banks as per their licensing requirements have to confine themselves to Islamic businesses and products, while conventional banks with Islamic windows have inherent advantage as they can compete more aggressively offering both conventional and Islamic businesses. Different approaches to licensing are debated to have implications for competitiveness of industry whereby there is an argument put forward that in interest of fostering healthier competitions banks should be allowed to choose what they offer without imposition of licensing policy constraints.3 To propel Islamic industry allowing dedicated Islamic banks is a well accepted course as long as regulators do not shield or provide preferential treatment to these institutions but creates a level playing field in regulatory and supervisory oversight. Next stage of development  13. Competitiveness of Islamic finance in future would depend on how Government and regulators perceive and nurture future development of Islamic finance and address the issues highlighted above and develop institutional, regulatory and supervisory frameworks and their effective enforcement. In the next stage of Islamic finance development, there is need for more substantive work on Islamic finance in the areas of:  (i) Standardization of contracts and documentation which would reduce transaction costs and risks of litigation. (ii) Development of dispute resolution mechanism for Sharia compliance matters as regulators will not be in a position to resolve these. (iii) Proper implementation of evolving guidance of regulatory standards for special features of Islamic without comprising international standards to which both Islamic and conventional banks are to be subject too. (iv) Development of more interfaces between regulators – so far there seems to have been more systematic alliance between central banks to coordinate standard setting and its compliance. There is however need for better coordination between bank and non bank regulators and also for later to launch more initiatives to nurture nonbank Islamic sector.                                                   3  The McKinsey Qaurterly: Rethinking Regulation for Islamic Banking.

Hans Reckers: Interaction of market and credit risk Welcome address by Dr Hans Reckers, Member of the Executive Board of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the Conference on the Interaction of Market and Credit Risk, Berlin, 6 December 2007. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen I would like to warmly welcome you to our conference on the interaction of market and credit risk, which is being held jointly by the Research Task Force of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the Deutsche Bundesbank and the Journal of Banking and Finance. As a board member of the Deutsche Bundesbank, I am proud that our institution is hosting this conference of distinguished researchers, bank practitioners, regulators, and central bankers. I am especially proud that the Deutsche Bundesbank offered to host this conference more than one year ago when it was not at all clear that the interaction of market and credit risk would be receiving as much attention as it is today. Given recent events in the financial markets, the interaction of different risk types has become quite topical.  The conference topic was not chosen as a result of outstanding forecasting power. Rather, the main motivation of the Research Task Force to form a working group on the interaction of market and credit risk was the diversification benefits between market and credit risk – which have not really made it into the headlines. Instead, another aspect of the interaction of market and credit risk has become newsworthy. It is the question of how an economy is affected if credit risk starts to be traded or, in other words, if credit risk transforms into market risk. The uncertainty of who finally bears the risk can have more severe effects than market participants would have expected, say, one year ago. I will not talk too much about the ongoing turbulence in detail because I am sure that the reasons behind it deserve a rigorous analysis. Instead, let me give you some information on how this conference came into being. At the risk of boring the members of the working group on the interaction of market and credit risk, I think it may help participants from academia, the industry and regulatory authorities to relate the topic of the conference to the interests of these three groups. Traders in the front office have considered market and credit risk jointly for a long time, not only regarding counterparty risk but also for the purpose of capital arbitrage, for instance. By contrast, ten years ago this was hardly the case for the banking book, for which credit risk was mostly the only risk type considered.  About a decade ago, the trading of credit risk – either by securitisation or credit derivatives – started to grow rapidly. The chance to sell or buy credit risk, instead of holding loans until maturity, placed banks under increased pressure to know the present values of their assets well before maturity. This posed a challenge to risk modeling as present values depend in a complex way on market factors like interest rates or exchange rates. Therefore, it is not surprising that the growth of credit trade was accompanied by rapid technological progress, for instance, by the development of new credit portfolio models. It is difficult to say which came first or – in other words – whether these new risk measurement techniques were the egg and the increased credit trade the hen or vice versa. Technological progress has continued up to the present day. The interaction of market and credit risk is being taken into account by more and more sophisticated models. The increased trade of credit on the one hand offers an opportunity to further diversification of credit risk over the whole financial system and to contribute to financial stability. On the BIS Review 146/2007 1 
other hand, it can also be seen as a development incurring new risks, be it by an inadequate recognition of risks inside a single bank, be it by new adverse risk-taking incentives or by the imperfection of hedges, be it, finally, by new effects that no one had discovered before. These developments are a first reason for bank managers, regulators and central bankers to improve their understanding of the interaction of market and credit risk.  In addition to these developments, some industry representatives were concerned that diversification effects between market risk and credit risk were being ignored by regulators, which could lead to too high minimum capital requirements. A deeper understanding of diversification effects and their relevance for risk aggregation in banks is a second reason to have a conference on the interaction of market and credit risk.  At the end of 2005, the Research Task Force project group on the interaction of market and credit risk received the mandate, first, to collect and summarise information on the state of the art of measuring the interaction of market and credit risk, and second, to set up and to conduct its own research projects in a rather broad field. As this was a vastly unexplored research area, the new working group has become one of the most research-oriented groups of the Research Task Force. Ladies and Gentlemen, this conference contributes to bringing together three groups involved with the interaction of market and credit risk: bank practitioners, regulators, and researchers. The need to make them exchange their ideas and knowledge is obvious. The interaction of market and credit risk is simply too complex to be recognised without a proper methodological framework. Both bank practitioners and regulators therefore need input from researchers. Researchers, in turn, need to learn from regulators’ and bankers’ experiences. Finally, bank practitioners and regulators are in close contact either way, and should be so. Thus, it comes as no surprise that hosting this conference ties in very well with several of the Bundesbank’s activities that aim at bringing industry, regulators and research together. Such events are, for instance, the RTF conference on concentration risk in autumn 2005 or the annual series of Bundesbank Spring Conferences and Autumn Conferences, all on science-related topics. This series now enjoy a fairly high reputation. Ladies and Gentlemen, as my time is almost over, let me take the opportunity to thank Philipp Hartmann from the ECB and Klaus Düllmann from the Bundesbank who have assumed the burden of being main organisers of this conference. I would also like to thank the scientific committee who did a great job of selecting 13 papers out of more than 80 submissions, and Hiroaki Kuwahara from the Basel Secretariat for his support in preparing this workshop. Last but not least, my thanks go to Ms Bothe and her team and all the other people who have contributed to this workshop in one way or another. Once again, I would like to extend a warm welcome to you at the workshop and hope you have two days of lively and enriching discussion. 2 BIS Review 146/2007 
Jean-Claude Trichet: The process of European economic and financial integration Keynote speech by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, at the Journalist Symposium “Konvent für Deutschland”, Berlin, 5 December 2007. *      *      * 1.  Introduction1  Es ist mir eine große Ehre, als Gastredner zu diesem Journalisten-Symposium in Berlin geladen zu sein, um über die wirtschaftliche und finanzielle Integration in Europa zu sprechen. Der Gedanke ist nicht neu. Bereits als der Vertrag von Rom vor einem halben Jahrhundert unterzeichnet wurde, stand der freie grenzüberschreitende Verkehr von Waren, Dienstleistungen, Kapital und Personen im Mittelpunkt der Bemühungen der innereuropäischen Politik, die schließlich zum europäischen Binnenmarkt führen sollten.  [It is a great pleasure for me to be invited as a guest speaker to this Journalist Symposium in Berlin to talk about European economic and financial integration. The idea of financial and economic integration is not new. Even at the time the Treaty of Rome was signed, half a century ago, the prime focus of intra-European policies was on facilitating the free flow of goods, services, capital and people across national frontiers, an initiative which was to become the Single Market.] If you will allow me, I will now continue in English.  Today, the European Union comprises 27 countries and a population totalling 494 million people, with Romania and Bulgaria joining in January of this year. The impressive enlargement of the EU has gone hand in hand with the successful creation of Economic and Monetary Union among 13 of the EU countries and 317 million citizens. The 13 will become 15 in January of next year, when Cyprus and Malta join the euro area, adding another 1 million people to the population of the euro area. However, Europe still needs to make progress to fully reap the benefits from the euro. In this respect, achieving the objective of the “Konvent für Deutschland”, which is to enhance the ability to make reforms in Germany, is urgently needed. This brings me to the issue I should like to address today, namely that of European economic and financial integration. First, I should like to share with you some facts on the process of economic and financial integration in Europe. Second, I should like to talk about economic adjustment processes. Smooth adjustment processes are further enhanced by economic and financial integration and are crucial for the proper functioning of the European economies.  2.  Economic and financial integration in Europe  Allow me now to elaborate on three aspects of economic integration in Europe, namely trade, labour mobility and business cycle synchronisation.  i) First, economic integration has been reflected in a marked increase in intra-euro area trade in goods and services. Let me mention some figures. The share of exports and imports of goods in terms of GDP within the euro area increased by 6 percentage points between 1998 and 2006, to stand at around 32% of GDP. The                                                  1  I should like to thank Malin Andersson for her input into this speech, Klaus Masuch and Hans-Joachim Klöckers for their helpful comments, as well as Katherine Brandt, Annalisa Ferrando, Arne Gieseck, Matthew Hart, Christophe Kamps and Andrea Lüske for their additional contributions. BIS Review 145/2007 1 
share of intra-euro area exports and imports of services increased by about 2 percentage points in this period, to almost 7% of GDP.  As trade integration within the euro area becomes stronger, the region is also becoming more open to the outside world. The share of extra-euro area exports and imports of goods rose by about 9 percentage points between 1998 and 2006, to around 33% of GDP. Over the same period, the share of extra-euro area exports and imports of services increased by about 2 percentage points, to almost 10% of GDP. German extra-euro area trade contributed particularly strongly to these developments, increasing from 31% of German GDP in 1998 to 51% in 2006. German trade is a good example of the fact that the euro area is an open economy and not a “fortress Europe”. By comparison, in the United States, exports and imports of goods are lower, representing about 22% of GDP and trade in services 6% in 2006.  ii) A second aspect of the process of economic integration is the degree of synchronisation or co-movement between different cyclical positions across the euro area countries. This degree of synchronisation has increased since the beginning of the 1990s. In other words, a large number of euro area economies now share similar business cycles.  In addition, the decline in inflation differentials across the euro area countries has been impressive in recent years. The level of dispersion is currently at a lower level than that among 14 US Metropolitan Statistical Areas.2 Dispersion in real GDP growth rates across the euro area countries has been fluctuating around a level similar to the one observed in output growth across regions within the United States.3  iii) Labour mobility within the EU constitutes a third aspect of economic integration that I should like to mention. Labour mobility offers additional choices to workers. It can dampen the effects from country-specific shocks and decrease the risks of wage pressures as labour markets tighten. Available evidence suggests that, overall, cross-border labour mobility is still limited within the European Union with regulatory barriers still existing, even within the euro area itself with respect to labour from Slovenia, for example. Germany belongs to the countries which currently prevent labour mobility from some EU countries. This comes at a time when many companies are reporting problems in finding properly skilled labour. For instance, the German industry currently reports very significant shortages of labour, according to a survey by the European Commission.  Comparable figures on labour mobility for the EU and the United States are difficult to obtain and any such figures should be interpreted very cautiously. Still, in the United States, geographical labour mobility appears to be far higher.  Let me now turn to financial integration in Europe. The introduction of the euro has contributed to intra-European financial integration which, in turn, has facilitated the free                                                  2  At the beginning of the 1990s, the dispersion in inflation rates across the countries, which now belong to the euro area, was, on average, around 6 percentage points (standard deviation measured in unweighted terms). So far this year, the inflation dispersion was only 0.5 percentage point. Dispersion among 14 US Metropolitan Statistical Areas has moved around 1 percentage point over the past two decades. Dispersion in real GDP growth rates across the euro area countries has been fluctuating around a level of 2 percentage points over the past few decades. 3  It should be stressed that while some differences are temporary, others are more persistent. Sustained differences in economic growth or inflation rates between some euro area countries are normal in a monetary union, to the extent that they are related to catching-up phenomena. However, it is also true that persistent differentials which reflect structural rigidities are a concern. 2 BIS Review 145/2007 
movement of capital in the euro area. Financial integration strengthens competition and raises the potential for stronger non-inflationary economic growth.4 It also improves the smooth and effective transmission of the single monetary policy throughout the euro area.  Financial integration also helps financial systems to channel funds from those economic agents that have a surplus of savings to those with a shortage; in particular, it enables agents to effectively trade, hedge, diversify and pool risks. As a result, there is a better sharing and diversification of risk.  According to academic research, in the United States, over the period 1963-90, capital markets smoothed out 39% of the shocks to gross state product (the equivalent to GDP), the credit channel smoothed out 23% and the federal government, through the fiscal channel, 13%.5 Around 25% of the shocks were not smoothed out. Hence financial markets and financial institutions contributed 62% to the absorption of idiosyncratic state shocks. We therefore see from the US example that the financial channel can be much more important than the fiscal channel. This is an additional reason for speeding up financial integration in Europe. In a more recent study, it was found that the situation in the euro area countries has begun to converge towards that of the United States as inter-euro area country capital flows increase. It was found that in what would become the euro area countries (excluding Luxembourg), capital markets would have smoothed out about 10% of the country-specific shocks to GDP between 1993 and 2000.6  A set of indicators, published by the ECB, points to an increasing degree of integration of euro area financial and banking markets since 1999.7 Moreover, the size of capital markets – in terms of the ratio of the total value of stock, bond and loan markets to GDP – has increased substantially since 1999, and has the potential to grow even further, as seen from a comparison with the United States. In the period 1995-99, it was 177% of GDP in the euro area and 279% in the United States; in 2005-06 it had increased to 256% in the euro area, and 353% of GDP in the United States. In Germany this ratio rose from 202% to 229% of GDP. Integration in retail banking, by contrast, has been slow so far. There are still significant differences in bank deposit and lending interest rates across euro area countries. In the euro area, the cross-country dispersion is higher than the intra-regional dispersion of the same rates in the United States.8  This notwithstanding, overall there is evidence of growing economic and financial integration among the countries of the European Union. The adoption of the euro has contributed to this development by reducing information costs, enhancing price transparency and eliminating exchange rate risk between countries in the euro area. Nonetheless, in some fields, a lot                                                  4  A research study conducted by London Economics estimated the benefits of the integration of European bonds and equity markets to be around 1% of additional GDP over a ten-year period.

remains to be done, for example, that of increasing intra-euro area labour mobility and financial integration in retail banking.  3.  Adjustment processes in the euro area Economic and financial integration are prerequisites for the smooth functioning of the euro area. In a monetary union like the euro area, where regional monetary and exchange rate policies are no longer available options, it is important to ensure that market adjustment mechanisms function properly. Such mechanisms are needed in order to prevent a country or region, after experiencing a country-specific shock, from entering into a period of protracted low growth and higher unemployment, or into a long period of overheating.  There are many factors that can improve the resilience of the euro area economies to adverse shocks. In this context, the ECB’s monetary policy contributes to the proper functioning of adjustment mechanisms within the euro area by ensuring price stability, by being credible in ensuring price stability and therefore by anchoring such price stability in economic agents’ expectations and decisions. This anchoring of expectations is important for enabling market participants to set suitable prices. And let me add that the best way to anchor inflation expectations is through an independent and accountable central bank. German history provides the best possible example of this. Well-designed structural policies that enhance flexibility in product and labour markets are crucial for absorbing shocks more effectively. Needless to say, the responsibility for the implementation of such policies is in the hands of national governments, of parliaments, and of social partners. In this context, the Lisbon strategy is a fundamental and ambitious programme designed to draw Europe’s attention to the urgency of structural reforms. Such reforms improve long-term growth prospects in the euro area by, on the one hand, positively affecting labour participation and, on the other, improving labour productivity growth through the promotion of innovation and technological change. We know very well that structural reforms often face both resistance from economic agents and sensitivities in public opinion. Therefore, it is essential to understand and communicate that the medium to long-term benefits of structural reforms will significantly outweigh any short-term cost. The ECB therefore strongly supports governments in their implementation of structural reforms. For instance, in Germany, the labour market reforms, implemented a few years ago, have significantly contributed to job creation, lower unemployment and the recent economic upswing. It is essential that those results are not jeopardised by interrupting or even reversing the reform process. Unemployment in Germany is still high and further reforms are required to better utilise the labour potential here in this country.  More specifically, on the labour market, economic flexibility can be promoted by removing the institutional barriers to flexible wage and price-setting mechanisms. Let me stress that governments and social partners share responsibility for ensuring that wage determination appropriately takes into account labour market conditions at the industrial, sectoral and regional level and does not jeopardise competitiveness and employment.9 Governments should be aware that wage setting in the public sector very often serves as a role model for the private sector. Moreover, sufficient wage differentiation is needed to improve employment opportunities for less skilled workers and in regions or sectors with high unemployment. In this respect, excessive wage regulations are undermining job creation, in particular for young and less qualified workers as well as for all those who face problems entering the labour                                                  9  See, for example, the analysis of the role of wage developments in the 1970s in explaining European unemployment in O. Blanchard, “The medium run”, Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, No. 2, 1997, pp. 89-141. 4 BIS Review 145/2007 
market. In particular, setting minimum wages at levels which are not in line with productivity reduces the employment chances of less skilled workers and of the unemployed.  As seen in Germany following unification, the period of adjustment can be painful, but reforms and unit labour cost moderation are finally paying off and they are contributing to robust growth. I remember some observers arguing several years ago that much stronger wage increases were needed in Germany for higher growth. The recent evidence does not confirm this view. On the contrary, the increased competitiveness seen in the German economy – thanks to moderate unit labour cost developments – has been an important prerequisite for the very strong job creation observed in recent years.  Not only in Germany, but also in the euro area as a whole, employment growth has been impressive in the eight and a half years since the euro changeover. Employment growth amounts to 14.9 million persons in the euro area, as opposed to only 3.8 million in the previous eight and a half years. Reforms are also needed in product markets. Let me first stress the importance of fully completing the Single Market, particularly in services and network industries. A deeper integration of markets would stimulate price flexibility by fostering competition and open product markets. Greater cross-border competition and the integration of markets across the euro area countries would contribute to lower prices. It could also enhance the adjustment processes in the individual countries in the event of asymmetric shocks or differing cyclical developments.  It is also important to promote further financial market integration and the development of readily available opportunities for portfolio diversification. This would help to attenuate the impact of country-specific shocks, as I mentioned earlier. National authorities can make a substantial contribution to ensuring the proper functioning of adjustment mechanisms within the euro area by conducting a well-designed fiscal policy. As I have stressed on many occasions, the best contribution fiscal policy can make to the proper functioning of the euro area is by being sustainable and medium-term oriented, fully in line with the orientations of the Stability and Growth Pact. Moreover, fiscal policy can and should also focus on increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of the public sector itself through high quality expenditure and tax policies. Large and inefficient public sectors are putting a brake on growth by imposing a high tax burden on the economy and channelling resources into unproductive uses.  In this respect, we welcome the efforts of the German government to reduce the regulatory burden further. In addition, the latest fiscal developments in Germany have been encouraging. For the first time since German reunification, the general government is expected to record a balanced budget, after having recorded a deficit above the Maastricht Treaty’s threshold of 3% of GDP over the period from 2002 to 2005. While partly based on revenue-increasing measures, such as the increase in the standard VAT rate at the beginning of the year, the success with fiscal consolidation can also be significantly attributed to expenditure restraint. Indeed, the share of government expenditure to GDP has dropped by 4½ percentage points over the past four years, reaching a level considerably lower than the euro area average. At the current juncture, it is important that the government stay on course, maintaining moderate expenditure growth while strengthening the incentives to work and invest. If policies continue on the path of structural expenditure restraint and lasting improvement in fiscal balances, Germany could become a fiscal role model in the euro area and would be well prepared for fiscal challenges in the short and long run.  It is particularly important that countries prepare themselves for less favourable economic conditions and the rising fiscal burden, in the longer run, associated with population ageing. In this context, the gradual increase of the pension age in Germany is an important step in the right direction. It will help to reduce the large ageing-related fiscal burden on the younger and active generations. BIS Review 145/2007 5 
Let me finally mention the crucial issue of competitiveness, which is one of the most important market-based adjustment mechanisms in a monetary union.10 Competitiveness is usually assessed on the basis of various measures of cost and price competitiveness11, complemented by accounting for some “non-price” factors, such as the quality and the technological content of the goods produced. A special feature of competitiveness differentials in the euro area is their persistence. Over the period between 1999 and 2006 there is a difference of up to around 25 percentage points between the euro area countries with the lowest and highest cumulative growth rates for unit labour costs for the economy as a whole. Germany and Austria belong to the first group of countries, while Ireland, Portugal and Greece belong to the second. Persistent differences in competitiveness may be a normal phenomenon when an economy is in the process of sustainable catching-up, leading to a higher level of per capita income, or whenever an economy has to cope with structural changes or past shocks of any nature that would be reflected in a new relative price equilibrium. That being said, persistent losses in relative cost competitiveness can also relate, for instance, to a number of structural rigidities leading to inertia in price and wage formation. They may be worrying signals for an economy, indicating a need for caution. Hence, developments in price and cost competitiveness across the euro area economies need to be closely monitored.  It is important for all parties concerned – the private sector, social partners, the national public authorities – to contribute to flexibility in prices and wages. In this manner, economically unjustified losses of competitiveness would be avoided and the risk of possibly protracted adjustment costs through the competitiveness channel minimised.  4.  Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, let me conclude. The single currency and Economic and Monetary Union have been an impressive and remarkable success, perhaps Europe’s most remarkable since the Treaty of Rome was signed. It is up to all of us to consolidate this great success and ensure that it is reinforced in the years to come. As regards monetary policy, Europe can count on the European Central Bank and the Eurosystem to be faithful to its primary mandate and to deliver price stability in the medium run to our 317 million fellow citizens. As regards other policy areas, which do not depend on the central bank, let me stress the three areas where sound policies are absolutely of the essence: sound fiscal policies, fully in line with the Stability and Growth Pact; structural reform policies, fully in line with the Lisbon strategy and the achievement of the Single Market; and last but not least appropriate monitoring of the relative cost competitiveness indicators in the euro area.  It is encouraging to see that past reforms have contributed to job creation and reduced unemployment. It is important that governments continue in this direction and do not reverse past reforms just at the point when they are starting to bear fruit. Thank you very much for your attention.                                                  10  See, for an extensive discussion of adjustment mechanisms, “The EU economy 2006 review: adjustment dynamics in the euro area – experiences and challenges”, European Commission, 2006 and F.

Nils Bernstein: Recent economic and financial developments in Denmark Speech by Mr Nils Bernstein, Governor of the National Bank of Denmark, at the Annual Meeting of the Danish Bankers Association, Copenhagen, 5 December 2007. *      *      * For some years, the global financial system has been characterised by high growth and increasing business volumes. There has been considerable innovation, many new products and business concepts have emerged. Earnings have been high. The largest global banks' return on equity has been steadily increasing for a number of years and exceeded 20 per cent on average in the 1st half of 2007.  A sudden setback came over a few days in the summer. For a while the US housing market had been regarded as vulnerable. Losses on subprime mortgages were increasing, but this market was not assessed to be sufficiently large to have an impact on global financial stability. Moreover, the launch of new financial instruments seemed to have helped to spread the subprime risk among many different investors.  This assessment proved to be wrong.  Via structured credit products, investment vehicles had invested in subprime mortgages. To finance these investments, they had issued short-term securities. It turned out that large banks were closely linked to these investment vehicles via liquidity lines and/or ownership. Consequently, it was also difficult to assess the banks' potential losses on subprime mortgages, and uncertainty arose as to who ultimately bore the subprime risk.  In next to no time, some of the most liquid markets with the highest ratings came to a standstill and it became difficult to issue short-term securities guaranteed by gilt-edged banks. Throughout most of the world, banks concentrated on securing their own liquidity and were hesitant to lend excess liquidity to other banks – especially if the maturities exceeded a few days. Two German banks experienced difficulties as a result of exposures to investment vehicles. One UK bank was brought to its knees, not by subprime mortgages, but because its business model was based on regular access to financing in the financial and money markets. We even saw the unusual sight of depositors queuing outside a bank to withdraw their deposits! This marked the beginning of the liquidity crisis that has – to varying degrees – characterised the financial and money markets in large parts of the world since July. Over the last four months, the central banks in the USA, the euro area and the UK have regularly provided collateralised liquidity to the market in order to stabilise short-term interest rates and smoothe the functioning of the money market.  There is still considerable uncertainty regarding the size of the losses and the future development. Now and then new skeletons rattle out of the closets as banks announce further subprime losses. Share prices have dropped for banks exposed to subprime mortgages. In the financial markets, there are fears that the losses will spread to other segments of the US mortgage market. Consequently, the spread between uncollateralised and collateralised money-market interest rates at long maturities remains unusually wide in many countries. Finally, the liquidity crisis has led many euro area and US banks to tighten their credit terms for several customer groups.  What are the consequences of the financial turmoil for Denmark? I will focus on two issues. Firstly, how has the development affected the Danish financial system? And secondly, what is the cyclical impact of the turmoil?  At the very short end of the money market, the international financial turmoil has not reduced the Danish banks' readiness to lend kroner to each other. There are indications of a certain increase in precautionary liquidity, but there have been no signs of tension in the short end of BIS Review 145/2007 1 
the money market, and Danmarks Nationalbank has not had to conduct extraordinary open market operations in this connection.  Danmarks Nationalbank's normal open market operations take place via a so-called open window. The demand for loans and certificates of deposit is met at the rate of interest determined by Danmarks Nationalbank. In other words, the counterparties have a fairly wide scope for structuring their liquidity vis-à-vis Danmarks Nationalbank. The development in the banks' and mortgage-credit institutes' accounts with Danmarks Nationalbank does not indicate any substantial increase in precautionary liquidity via this channel. Longer-term uncollateralised money-market interest rates in kroner have increased due to the international turmoil. The fluctuations in the spread between uncollateralised and collateralised money-market interest rates have, however, been less pronounced in Denmark than in the euro area and especially the USA. Even in normal circumstances the turnover in this segment of the Danish money market is relatively limited, but naturally the higher interest rates have affected the numerous financial products linked to CIBOR and similar interest rates. From time to time, Danish banks have had difficulties in raising dollar-denominated loans. This is not an isolated Danish phenomenon; banks in other European countries have experienced the same difficulties. Danmarks Nationalbank cannot provide liquidity facilities to cover borrowing requirements in foreign exchange since its role is primarily linked to krone-denominated liquidity. Banks with large business volumes in foreign exchange must themselves ensure adequate contingency funding plans in the relevant currencies.  Overall, the Danish money market has navigated fairly successfully through these rough waters, which ultimately shows that the Danish financial system is in good shape. Nevertheless, Denmark has been affected by the international turmoil. Financial statements for the 3rd quarter showed that Danish banks were also exposed to investment vehicles, liquidity lines and structured credit products. The exposures and losses were, however, relatively small in size.  Lending by Danish banks has increased substantially in recent years, and some have seen growth rates in excess of 30 per cent. Earnings have been high and losses low. Particularly mortgage loans to homeowners have grown significantly.  Growth in lending has been so strong that a large deposit-loan gap of more than kr. 400 billion has accumulated. This is the amount by which the banks' lending exceeds the deposits from customers. Consequently, the Danish banks have to rely on the financial and money markets as sources of financing. Developments abroad over the summer have shown that it can be risky to base one's business on such financing. The price of market financing may change rapidly, and the markets may "dry up". The international liquidity crisis has provided an opportunity to test the contingency funding plans and review the business strategy in the light of the findings.  It is not as easy as it used to be for the Danish banks to finance their growth via the financial and money markets. Financing has become more expensive, and the rising costs of financing will undoubtedly be reflected in the banks' earnings and the prices charged to customers. Growth in lending remains high, but declining. Some banks have adopted a less aggressive business strategy and put their expansion plans on hold. Others have expressed intentions to reduce their commitments to international investment vehicles, liquidity lines and structured credit products due to reputational risk.  Developments have shown that strategies based on double-digit growth rates cannot simply be extended. The strong growth in lending to the corporate sector entails a greater risk of losses to the banks. This risk is rising, but from a very low level.  Unpleasant surprises can never be ruled out, but the economy is still favourable. And the financial statements for the 3rd quarter also showed that the banks' earnings remain high. Solvency is generally sound, and writedowns are low. Viewed in that perspective, Danmarks 2 BIS Review 145/2007 
Nationalbank is currently of the opinion that the international turmoil may serve as a "useful" wake-up call for the Danish banks. The necessary adaptations to the changing circumstances can be made in a timely manner without any serious costs to the large majority of the banks or to the economy as a whole. What is the cyclical impact of the turmoil?  Growth in the global economy has been unusually high in recent years. However, the turmoil in the financial markets has given rise to concern about the future development.  Growth has declined in the USA, although the crisis in the US mortgage market and the derived financial turmoil has not yet been fully reflected in the rest of the economy. So far, the upswing is set to continue in Europe and Asia, and the outlook is also positive for Africa and Latin America. Oil prices have risen strongly in recent months and have put a damper on growth prospects while also adding to inflationary pressures.  Until now, the international organisations have reduced their growth forecasts only moderately – except in respect of the USA, where growth in 2008 is now predicted to be less than 2 per cent – but no recession is foreseen. Clear concerns are expressed as to whether the uncertainty linked to the financial markets and the downturn in the housing market – not only in the USA – will spread to the rest of the economy, thereby further curbing growth in the USA and also affecting Europe.  In a Danish perspective, the outlook for the export markets remains positive, but with a downward trend.  Denmark is still in a strong boom with a hot labour market and capacity pressures on large parts of the economy.  The rate of unemployment remains surprisingly low.  The tight labour market means that the capacity pressure will remain high, although growth in demand is expected to moderate somewhat. This pressure has led to a surge in imports and in recent quarters also to a higher rate of wage increase and higher domestic price pressure, reflecting the fact that wages and prices normally react to cyclical developments with a substantial time lag. A potential setback may therefore be prolonged if the cost level at the outset is too high compared with abroad.  The high temperature in the economy at the moment entails a major risk that this will be the case.  On account of the fixed-exchange-rate policy, interest rates in Denmark are aligned with those of the euro area, which is not as far into the economic cycle as Denmark is. Contrary to expectations, interest rates have not risen recently. This is due to the turmoil in the financial markets.  In this situation it would be somewhat remarkable if the Danish government still proposes an expansionary fiscal policy in 2008. When preparing the new Finance Bill for 2008, the government should reassess its fiscal policy with a view to easing the pressure on the economy. Omitting to do so may entail tougher requirements at a later stage.  Next spring will bring collective bargaining within the public sector. Among public-sector employees there are expectations of sizeable pay rises, supported by recent years' shortage of labour and focus on the quality of public-sector services.  Several political parties have spoken in favour of an extraordinary wage boost for large or small groups of public-sector employees via a special pool of funds earmarked for this purpose.  I would like to issue a strong warning against making wage bargaining in the public-sector labour market a parliamentary issue at this stage. The risk that the parties will attempt to BIS Review 145/2007 3 
outdo one another is imminent, and premature intervention by the politicians prevents genuine bargaining. This could set a very unfortunate precedent.  As if that was not enough, next spring will also see collective bargaining in the financial sector. I therefore take this opportunity to point out that the results in this sector may send a signal to the rest of the labour market.  Finally, I would like to thank the Danish Bankers Association for our fine cooperation. I look forward to continuing along the same positive lines.  4 BIS Review 145/2007 
Rakesh Mohan: India's financial sector reforms – fostering growth while containing risk Address by Dr Rakesh Mohan, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at Yale University, New Haven, 3 December 2007. Assistance of Michael Patra, Muneesh Kapur and Indranil Bhattacharya in preparing the speech is gratefully acknowledged. *      *      * I am honoured to be back at Yale where I got my basic economics grounding from James Tobin, Bill Nordhaus, and Robert Evenson, among others. In all these years, this is my first lecture at Yale, so I am particularly pleased to have this opportunity. Thank you Professor Srinivasan. The turmoil in international financial markets since late July this year and the increased uncertainty that financial markets are currently experiencing have brought issues relating to financial sector stability to the fore. In some ways, the recent developments are unprecedented in their occurrence and in terms of the emerging magnitude of financial sector losses. The sudden loss of confidence among traditional counterparties reflects extreme information asymmetry arising from the complex layering of risk diffusion and high leveraging; and the breakdown of risk assessment by reputed rating agencies and the like. The speed of contagion and the extensive involvement of large, reputed and regulated financial institutions are indicative of regulatory shortcomings, which has then necessitated unconventional responses of central banks. All this has raised serious concerns relating to the ability and flexibility of national financial systems to withstand shocks emanating from such unusual developments. It has also spurred some reconsideration on some aspects of monetary policy and of financial regulation, particularly as they relate to the maintenance of financial stability.  India has so far remained relatively insulated from these developments and our impact analyses suggest that our exposure to troubled sub-prime assets and related derivatives is negligible in comparison to many other economies. Whereas this may be regarded by some as fortuitous, it is perhaps our nuanced approach to financial sector reform and development that has served us well; our approach has been marked by conscious gradualism with the implementation of coordinated and sequenced moves on several fronts that are predicated on the preparedness for change of the financial system in particular, and of the economy in general. We have also built in appropriate safeguards to ensure stability, while taking account of the prevailing governance standards, risk management systems and incentive frameworks in financial institutions in the country. Overall, these progressive but cautious policies have contributed to efficiency of the financial system while sustaining the growth momentum in an environment of macroeconomic and financial stability. Nevertheless, we in the Reserve Bank are maintaining enhanced vigilance to be able to respond appropriately to the prevailing heightened uncertainties in global financial conditions. The policy challenge is to continue to ensure financial stability in India during this period of international financial turbulence, while maintaining the momentum of high growth accompanied by price stability.  Against this backdrop, I thought I would take this opportunity to review India's approach to financial sector reforms, the path we have traversed for over almost two decades from a restrictive, even repressed past, the nuances of our somewhat unorthodox approach to instituting competition and efficiency in financial intermediation and the challenges we face in the development of our financial sector in the years ahead.  BIS Review 145/2007 1 
I.  Financial sector reforms and outcomes In retrospect, the key success of financial sector reforms in India since they were instituted in the early 1990s has been the maintenance of financial stability through a period marked by repeated financial crises across the world. The process of reforms is noteworthy not only for the turbulence around its path but also for the sheer dimensions of the change achieved from the position where we started.  Until the beginning of the 1990s, the state of the financial sector in India could be described as a classic example of “financial repression” (MacKinnon 1973; Shaw 1973). The sector was characterised, inter alia, by administered interest rates, large pre-emption of resources by the authorities, extensive micro-regulations directing the major portion of the flow of funds to and from financial intermediaries, relatively opaque accounting norms and limited disclosure, and dominant public ownership. Compartmentalisation of activities of different types of financial intermediaries and strong entry barriers thwarted competition resulting in low levels of efficiency and productivity and severe credit constraints on the private sector, especially in the absence of any access to external finance. Capitalisation levels were low due to lack of commercial considerations in credit planning and weak recovery culture which also resulted in large accumulation of non-performing loans. The predominance of Government securities in the fixed-income securities market of India mainly reflected the captive nature of this market as most financial intermediaries were mandated to invest a sizeable portion of funds mobilised by them in such securities to finance high Government borrowings at administered/concessional interest rates. In the capital market, new equity issues were governed by a plethora of complex regulations and extensive restrictions with very little transparency and depth in the secondary market trading of such securities. Comprehensive exchange control resulted in little depth in the foreign exchange market with most external transactions governed by inflexible/low limits and prior approval requirements. Monetary policy was subservient to the fisc. The provision of fiscal accommodation through ad hoc treasury bills led to high levels of monetisation of fiscal deficit during the major part of the 1980s. The expansionary effects of fiscal spending were sought to be curbed through interest rate regulations, credit rationing and high reserve requirements, effectively preventing the development of financial markets.  Elsewhere, I have attempted to document the various facets of India’s experience with financial sector reforms – the guiding objectives and intellectual/analytical underpinnings; the choice of pace and sequencing; specific aspects of policy measures for the banking sector, non-bank financial companies, term lending institutions and other financial intermediaries; development of financial markets; and changes in the monetary policy framework (Mohan, 2004; Mohan, 2006c). Today, I propose to undertake an evaluation of the financial sector reforms in terms of actual outcomes.  II.1  Monetary policy While assessing monetary policy, it would be reasonable to assert that it has been largely successful in meeting its key objectives in the post-reforms period since the early 1990s. Inflation has averaged close to five per cent per annum in the decade gone by, notably lower than the average of 7-8 per cent in the previous four decades. Structural reforms from the early 1990s coupled with improved monetary-fiscal interface and reforms in the Government securities market enabled better monetary management from the second half of the 1990s onwards. A number of other factors such as increased competition, productivity gains and strong corporate balance sheets have also contributed to this low and stable inflation environment, but it appears that calibrated monetary measures had a substantial role to play as well. More importantly, the regime of low and stable inflation has, in turn, stabilised inflation expectations and the threshold level of inflation tolerance in the economy has come down significantly (Table 1).   2 BIS Review 145/2007 
  It is encouraging to note that despite the high international crude oil prices, other commodity prices and elevated food prices, inflation remains low and inflation expectations appear to be consistent and stable. Consequently, both nominal and real interest rates have fallen. Due to both financial restructuring and low interest rates in recent years, the growth rate in interest expenses of the corporates has declined consistently since 1995-96; such decline has significant implications for the improvement in bottom lines of the corporates sector as a whole and their resilience to financial shocks.  In terms of the monetary policy framework, India’s approach has been somewhat unorthodox. Traditionally, central banks have pursued the twin objectives of price stability and growth or employment, while in recent years, greater attention has been given to the maintenance of price stability through inflation targeting regimes. Although there is no explicit mandate for price stability in the Indian context, the objectives of monetary policy in India have evolved as those of maintaining a judicious balance between price stability and ensuring adequate flow of credit to the productive sectors of the economy. Considerations of financial stability, however, have ascended the hierarchy of monetary policy objectives in recent years in view of the increasing openness of the Indian economy, financial integration and the possibility of cross border contagion. Accordingly, we believe that regulation, supervision and development of the financial system remain within the legitimate ambit of overall monetary policy broadly interpreted.  In the wake of financial sector reforms and opening up of the economy in the 1990s, the Reserve Bank switched over in 1998-99 to a multiple indicator approach whereby macroeconomic and financial market data on both quantum and rate variables are all examined, along with output, in framing monetary policy. We believe that the specific features of the Indian economy, including its socio-economic characteristics, make it necessary for the monetary authority to operate with multiple objectives and indicators for some time to come. A single objective for monetary policy, as is usually advocated, particularly in an inflation targeting (IT) framework, is a luxury that India cannot afford, at least over the medium term. As regards IT, even though there has been an increase in the number of central banks adopting IT since the early 1990s, a number of central banks, notably the Federal Reserve, retain multiple objectives. Internationally, there is no unique or even best way of monetary policy making and different approaches or frameworks can lead to successful policies by adapting appropriately to diverse institutional, economic and social environments (Issing, 2004). Moreover, some evidence suggests that average inflation as well as its volatility in prominent non-IT industrial countries has, in fact, been somewhat lower than that in prominent IT industrial countries. IT is not found to have any beneficial effect on the level of long-term interest rates either BIS Review 145/2007 3 
(Gramlich, 2003; Ball and Sheridan, 2003). Furthermore, an IT framework reduces the flexibility available to a central bank in reacting to shocks (Kohn, 2003). EMEs face additional problems in an IT regime. These economies are typically more open and it exposes them to large exchange rate shocks which can have a significant influence on short-run inflation. A boom-bust pattern of capital flows can lead to substantial movements in exchange rates. EMEs may have to manage exchange rates more heavily since they are more commodity-price sensitive than advanced economies and commodity price fluctuations can wreak havoc with the forecastability of consumer price inflation (Eichengreen, 2002). An empirical evaluation of the experience of EMEs that have adopted IT confirms that IT is a more challenging task in such economies compared to developed economies that have adopted IT. While inflation in EMEs was indeed lower after they adopted IT, their performance was not as good as that experienced in developed IT countries. Deviation of inflation from its targets is found to be larger and more common in EMEs (Fraga, Minella and Goldfaj, 2003). Inflation targeting by itself is not a sufficient condition for success. In view of the above, the characterization of inflation targeting as "the gold standard for stabilizing monetary policy" is misleading. Indeed, in the recent episode of financial market turmoil, even central banks with explicit inflation targeting or price stability as the predominant objective were forced to scale down the emphasis on price stability, notwithstanding continued inflationary pressures. Such central banks had to inject liquidity and reduce policy rates – in some cases, holding back the earlier expectations of tightening – as they had to lay greater emphasis on financial stability and growth.  The overall macroeconomic record of the Indian economy since the early 1990s indicates an acceleration in growth and a significant reduction in inflation. Inflation has averaged below 5 per cent in the current decade so far, substantially lower than that of around 8 per cent in the preceding two and a half decades. Pre-emptive monetary and prudential measures have led to this welcome situation of a reduction in inflation and acceleration in growth while ensuring financial stability. Indeed, a cross-country comparison of major EMEs that have adopted IT indicates that growth in India has been amongst the highest while inflation remains relatively low (Table 2). Amongst the sample of G-20 and major Asian countries, growth in India during 2000-2007 was the second highest after China. Inflation in India during the current decade has halved from that prevailing during the 1990s and is, at present, lower than many developing economies. A recent survey by McKinsey and Company of CEOs across the world, in both developed countries and Emerging Market Economies (EMEs), found that among all the countries surveyed, India had the highest proportion of CEOs, 40 per cent, who did not expect inflation to increase in coming years (McKinsey Quarterly, 2007). Thus, it would appear that, at least, among business leaders, inflation expectations are well-anchored in India. Although there has been above average growth in monetary and credit aggregates in the past 3-4 years, financial stability has been maintained through a judicious use of monetary and prudential measures. Thus, the recent record of macroeconomic management in India is exemplary, even amongst the EMEs that target inflation. The challenge for monetary policy now is to reduce inflation further in the medium term towards international levels, while maintaining the momentum of high growth and preserving financial stability. 4 BIS Review 145/2007 
 II.2 Banking sector In the post-reform period, banks have experienced strong balance sheet growth in an environment of operational flexibility. Concomitantly, the financial health of banks has improved significantly, both in terms of capital adequacy and asset quality. Moreover, this progress has been achieved while setting the groundwork for the adoption of international best practices in prudential and accounting norms. Increased competitiveness and productivity gains have also been enabled by proactive technological deepening and flexible human resource management. These significant gains have been achieved even while renewing our commitment to social banking viz., maintaining the wide reach of the banking system and directing credit towards important but disadvantaged sectors of society. The banking system's wide reach, judged in terms of expansion of branches and the growth of credit and deposits indicates continued financial deepening (Mohan, 2006a).  On the liability side, deposits continue to account for about 80 per cent of the total liabilities while on the asset side, the shares of loans and advances and investments have seen marked cycles, reflecting banks' portfolio preferences as well as growth cycles in the economy. In this regard, while the share of loans and advances declined in the second half of 1990s on account of the industrial slowdown as well as tightening of prudential norms, banks' credit portfolio has witnessed sharp growth in the period 2003-07.  BIS Review 145/2007 5 
The overall capital position of commercial banks has witnessed a marked improvement during the reform period (Table 3). Illustratively, as at end-March 2007, all 81 scheduled commercial banks operating in India maintained CRAR at or above 9 per cent relative to the Basel I norm of 8 per cent. For the Indian banking system, the ratio of capital to risk weighted assets works out to 13 per cent currently. While improved capitalisation of public sector banks was initially brought through infusion of funds by government to recapitalise these banks, subsequently, public sector banks were allowed to raise funds from the market through equity issuance subject to the maintenance of 51 per cent public ownership. As a result, ownership in public sector banks is now well diversified.     Despite tightening prudential norms in terms of classification of non-performing assets, the resulting measured asset quality of banks has improved considerably as the share of non-performing loans (NPLs) (as ratios of both total advances and assets) have declined substantially and consistently since the mid-1990s. In fact, the ratio of net NPLs to net advances at 1.0 per cent in India is now comparable to that of several advanced economies (Table 4). Improvement in the credit appraisal process, upturn of the business cycle, new initiatives for resolution of NPLs (including promulgation of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest (SARFAESI) Act), and greater provisioning and write-off of NPLs enabled by greater profitability, have contributed to the reduction in incremental NPLs. 6 BIS Review 145/2007 
  Efficiency gains are reflected in containment of the operating expenditure as a proportion of total assets (Table 5). This has been achieved in spite of large expenditures incurred by Indian banks in installation and upgradation of information technology and, in the case of public sector banks, large expenditures under voluntary pre-mature retirement of nearly 12 per cent of their total staff strength.     BIS Review 145/2007 7 
In consonance with the objective of enhancing efficiency and productivity of banks through greater competition, there has been a consistent decline in the share of public sector banks in total assets of commercial banks. Nevertheless, public sector banks appear to have responded to the new challenges of competition, as reflected in their increased share in the overall profit of the banking sector. This suggests that, with operational flexibility, public sector banks are competing relatively effectively with private sector and foreign banks. Shares of Indian private sector banks, especially new private sector banks established in the 1990s, in the total income and assets of the banking system have increased considerably since the mid-1990s (Table 6).     Indian private sector banks, particularly new private sector banks, have made rapid progress in terms of increasing their income and asset size since the mid-1990s. In terms of branch expansion, the compound growth rate of private sector banks over the period 2002-07 was almost three times that of all scheduled commercial banks and more than four times that of public sector banks (Table 7). Among the private sector banks, the four big banks viz., Centurion Bank of Punjab, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and UTI/Axis bank have experienced rapid branch expansion in the range of 16-46 per cent per annum in terms of compound growth rates. While private sector banks, as a group, have recorded a compound growth of 24 per cent per annum in their staff, public sector banks have witnessed a decline in the staff strength over the same period reflecting, inter alia, restructuring facilitated by greater use of 8 BIS Review 145/2007 
technology and computerisation. In terms of growth of capital and reserves and surplus, the new private sector banks experienced annual growth in the range of 30-68 per cent, while deposits and advances have increased by 32-51 per cent and 39-71 per cent, respectively. Net profits recorded a compound annual growth of 27-36 per cent. In terms of all these parameters, private sector banks grew much faster than the existing private sector banks, as might be expected. There has been some discussion in recent times on the policy of branch licensing of banks by the Reserve Bank of India: that it could have restricted competition and growth of new banks. These data exhibit the very high growth experienced by the leading private sector banks and it is arguable whether there could have been much faster expansion without impairing their prudential quality and integrity of their balance sheets.  What is most encouraging is the very significant improvement in the productivity of the Indian banking system in terms of various productivity indicators (Mohan, 2006a). These improvements could be driven by two factors: technological improvement, which expands the range of production possibilities and a catching up effect, as peer pressure amongst banks compels them to raise productivity levels. Here, the role of new business practices, new approaches and expansion of the business introduced by the new private banks have been of the utmost importance. To sum up, significant improvement in the performance of public sector banks has been witnessed over the past decade or so, facilitated by the phased introduction of wide-ranging financial sector reforms since the early 1990s. Gradual introduction of best international practices and norms, refinements in the supervisory practices, tightening of risk weights/provisioning norms in regard to sectors witnessing high credit growth, greater market discipline brought about by raising of capital from the capital markets and listing on the stock exchanges, interest rate deregulation, and scaling down of statutory pre-emptions are amongst the key factors that have led to better performance. Concomitantly, greater competition has been induced in the domestic banking sector by successful introduction of new generation private sector banks. Despite strong growth in balance sheets of the new banks, the banking system has exhibited remarkable stability. Although there have been a few instances of weaknesses in a few new private sector banks, pre-emptive measures in the form of the mergers of such banks with stronger banks, or infusion of new capital and change in ownership, on a voluntary or involuntary basis, have contributed to the strength of the domestic banking system, engendered confidence in the depositors and enabled maintenance of overall financial stability. Notwithstanding the substantial improvement, the domestic banking system will need to be further strengthened to face greater external competition and introduction of financial innovations and fuller capital account convertibility. BIS Review 145/2007 9 
  II.3  Financial markets The most notable impact of financial sector reforms is clearly discernible in the development of various segments of financial markets in India. The reforms since the early 1990s have led to a regime characterised by market-determined interest and exchange rates, price-based 10 BIS Review 145/2007 
instruments of monetary policy, current account convertibility, substantial capital account liberalisation and vibrant government securities and capital markets. Derivative instruments have been cautiously introduced in a phased manner, both for product diversity and, more importantly, as a risk management tool. All these developments have facilitated the process of price discovery in various financial market segments. There has been a significant increase in trading volumes and market liquidity (Table 8). Illustratively, average daily turnover in the money market has increased from Rs.427 billion in 1997-98 to over Rs.888 billion by 2006-07. The operations under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) have largely been able to steer overnight rates within the corridor set by the policy rates. Under the LAF, the Reserve Bank absorbs (reverse repo) as well as injects (repo) liquidity, depending upon the liquidity conditions and consistent with the overall monetary policy stance. Changes in fixed reverse repo/repo rates set by the RBI from time to time for the conduct of LAF, under which the central bank conducts daily auctions for the banks, have emerged as the main instruments for interest rate signalling in the Indian economy.    Inter-bank turnover in the foreign exchange market has nearly quadrupled between 2000-01 and 2006-07 to Rs. 840 billion. Average daily turnover in the foreign exchange market (inter-bank as well as merchant) has increased from US $ 5 billion in 1997-98 to US $ 23 billion by 2006-07. The exchange rate of the Indian rupee has exhibited significant two-way movements in the recent years. Efficiency in the foreign exchange market has also improved as reflected in the decline in bid-ask spreads.  In the government securities market, the issuance of long-term securities has enabled the development of yield curve across 30-year maturity. In the government securities market, the drop in turnover in 2004-05 and 2005-06 could be attributed to factors such as “buy and hold” tendency of the participants such as insurance companies, which now hold a substantial portion of government securities, particularly those of longer maturities. Furthermore, certain regulatory changes introduced in late 2004 allowing banks to hold a larger proportion of their BIS Review 145/2007 11 
investment portfolio in the “held to maturity” (HTM) category reduced the proportion of portfolio used for trading, thereby affecting the magnitude of G-sec trading. The decline could also be attributed to the increase in interest rates over the period, which prompted banks and other players to hold rather than trade, so as to avoid trading losses. To keep the markets liquid and active, the Reserve Bank has recently allowed short selling in government securities among eligible participants, and trading in the “when issued” segment, but these facilities have not seen much activity yet. Efforts are also on to increase liquidity through the active consolidation of existing securities.  The derivatives market has also gained vibrancy during the last couple of years. The total notional principal amount outstanding has more than trebled between March 2005 and June 2007 led by a significant jump in interest rate related contracts. Over this period, while the notional amount under interest rate related contracts quadrupled, that in foreign exchange contracts nearly trebled (Table 9). Certain legislative changes in 2006 provided clear legal legitimacy to OTC derivative contracts, which was somewhat ambiguous earlier.    The Government and the Securities and Exchange Board of India along with the Reserve Bank are taking steps to activate the corporate debt market. As has been experienced elsewhere, among the various financial markets, the corporate debt market is indeed the most difficult to develop for a variety of reasons. The expansion of the pension fund and insurance industries will progressively result in the presence of a larger financial investor base, which will help in the overall expansion of financial markets and in particular the corporate debt market. It is quite apparent that there exist well-functioning, deep, liquid, and well-integrated markets for bonds, currency and derivatives in India, contrary to what is often asserted. The trading volumes have generally witnessed significant growth in the various segments of the financial market. It is noteworthy that the increase in foreign exchange market turnover in India between April 2004 and April 2007 was the highest amongst the 54 countries covered in the latest Triennial Central Bank Survey of Foreign Exchange and Derivatives Market Activity conducted by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). According to the survey, daily average turnover in India jumped almost 5-fold from US $ 7 billion in April 2004 to US $ 34 billion in April 2007; global turnover over the same period rose by only 66 per cent from US $ 2.4 trillion to US $ 4.0 trillion. Reflecting these trends, the share of India in global foreign exchange market turnover trebled from 0.3 per cent in April 2004 to 0.9 per cent in April 2007. In view of the above, comments that are often made regarding missing financial markets are rather misleading. Moreover, empirical evidence points towards greater market 12 BIS Review 145/2007 
integration (Mohan, 2007c). A good deal of development has indeed taken place in the government securities market, the forex market, OTC interest rate derivatives and the like. The corporate bond market is indeed in its infancy; and, more efforts have to be made to develop various exchange traded derivative markets. It, however, needs to be recognised that financial markets are often governed by herd behaviour and contagion. Deregulation, liberalisation, emergence of financial conglomerates and globalisation of financial markets pose growing risks to financial stability. In this regard, it needs to be stressed that volatility in currency and bond markets can have significantly more adverse employment, output and distributional consequences compared to volatility in equity markets. Premature liberalisation of money and bond markets can lead to large and volatile capital inflows, which could potentially exacerbate complications for macroeconomic and monetary management. Furthermore, excessive fluctuations and volatility in financial markets can mask the underlying value and give confusing signals, as has happened in developed markets, thereby hindering efficient price discovery (Mohan, 2006c). As large segments of economic agents in India may not have adequate resilience to withstand volatility in currency and money markets, the Reserve Bank’s policy approach has been to be increasingly vigilant and proactive to any incipient signs of volatility in financial markets.  Notwithstanding the progress made since the early 1990s, the Reserve Bank recognises that domestic financial markets need to develop much further, especially in order to support the recent acceleration in growth momentum of the Indian economy and in the context of the envisaged move towards fuller capital account convertibility. The Indian experience demonstrates that development of markets is an arduous and time consuming task that requires conscious policy actions and effective implementation. Without real sector development in terms of the physical infrastructure and improvement in supply elasticities, the financial sector can misallocate resources, potentially generate bubbles and possibly amplify the risks. Hence, financial sector reforms have complementarity with the pace and process of reforms in the real sector in India.  Given the large weight on stability, especially in view of low income levels for a large segment of the population, the careful and cautious approach to development of financial markets followed so far would need to be pursued in the coming years. The pace of further progress would depend upon the development of the necessary expertise in the public sector banks, further expansion of private sector banks and foreign banks. We recognise the need to develop further various segments of the domestic financial market to help in better risk management by various market participants. The demand for various risk management tools could be expected to increase, especially in the presence of potentially larger fluctuations in exchange rate and interest rates in the future. In recognition of the need to widen the range of instruments available to market participants, the Reserve Bank has placed draft guidelines on introduction of credit derivatives in the country. More recently, a draft report on the introduction of currency futures in India has also been put in the public domain for comments and feedback; and work is in progress on the introduction of interest rate futures.  Summing up, it is widely recognised that the Indian financial sector over the last decade has been transformed into a reasonably sophisticated, diverse and resilient system delivering a wide variety of financial services efficiently and profitably, with a spectrum of financial market segments in which financial institutions are able to participate with operational and functional autonomy in an environment of increasing deregulation and international competition. The acceleration of growth in the real economy suggests that the financial system has served well the overall needs of the economy. During this period, while the global financial environment has become more risky in the wake of new instruments and participants and the rapid advance in communication technology integrating markets worldwide, a unique feature of the Indian reform process is that it has been instituted and carried forward with the objective of sustaining and accelerating the growth momentum while containing risk and entrenching financial stability. BIS Review 145/2007 13 
III.  Indian reform outcomes in the international context  Some commentators have criticised the Indian approach to financial sector reforms as unclear, timid and conservative in the context of the cross-country experience and have advocated more bold and drastic measures so as to speed up the transition to higher growth. There is also some discomfort with our approach to foreign banks, although even in this regard, we are ahead of WTO norms and we have set up roadmaps and review deadlines conditional upon broader consensus on international commerce in financial services. Admittedly, we have been cautious and somewhat conservative in our approach to financial sector reforms relative to some other EMEs. In this regard, it is important to note that not only has there been a steady upward shift in India’s growth path, but this has also been accompanied by enduring stability. A remarkable feature of India's growth experience has been its resilience to both global and domestic shocks. In this regard, while the broad objectives of financial sector reforms were to enhance efficiency and productivity, the process of reforms was initiated in a gradual and properly sequenced manner so as to have a reinforcing effect. The approach has been to consistently upgrade the financial sector by adopting the international best practices through a consultative process. With increased deregulation of financial markets and increased integration of the global economy, the 1990s were turbulent for global financial markets: 63 countries suffered from systemic banking crises in that decade, and 45 in the 1980s. Among countries that experienced such crises, the direct cost of reconstructing the financial system was typically very high: for example, recapitalisation of banks had cost 55 per cent of GDP in Argentina, 42 per cent in Thailand, 35 per cent in Korea and 10 per cent in Turkey. There were high indirect costs of lost opportunities and slow economic growth in addition (McKinsey & Co., 2005). It is therefore particularly noteworthy that India could pursue its process of financial deregulation and opening of the economy without suffering financial crises during this turbulent period in world financial markets. The cost of recapitalisation of public sector banks at less than 1 per cent of GDP is therefore low in comparison. In our own assessment, the gradualist approach has been appropriate, particularly in the context of democratic polity, and given the multi-ethnic and linguistic composition of the country. The steady pace of reforms has borne fruit, including larger sections of society within the reform process. What is remarkable is the sheer magnitude and quality of the reform effort as evident in actual outcomes. The banking system in India has undergone significant changes during the last 16 years. A cross-country survey of crucial banking indicators reveals that the Indian banking system is now comparable to those of developed economies in terms of key indicators (Table 10). The capital adequacy ratio at 12.4 per cent for the system as a whole at end March 2006 is comparable to that of most advanced economies. Similarly, banks’ non-performing loans to total loans have steadily declined and are lower than many emerging economies. In terms of return on assets, the Indian banking system’s performance is comparable to that of advanced economies such as Germany and the U.K.  14 BIS Review 145/2007 
  Cross-country comparisons indicate that many other countries have also achieved considerable progress in strengthening their banking sector. However, a noteworthy aspect of the Indian experience is that we have been able to strengthen our banking system without any crisis and with negligible cost to the fisc, while simultaneously achieving acceleration in growth, price stability and consistent development of financial markets. Our banking sector reform has been unique in the world in that it combines a comprehensive reorientation of competition, regulation and ownership in a non-disruptive and cost-effective manner. Indeed, our banking reform is a good illustration of the dynamism of the public sector in managing the overhang problems and the pragmatism of public policy in enabling the domestic and foreign private sectors to compete and expand (Reddy, 2007).  The overall stability that has been imparted to a system undergoing reforms has served us well so far in the face of the recent financial developments. To exemplify the argument, I thought I would spend some time on the recent financial developments, possible causes and likely consequences so as to better appreciate the conduct of India’s financial sector reforms.  IV. Recent international financial developers: issues in monetary policy and financial sector regulation In contrast to earlier crises, the cause-and-effect sequences are blurred in the current turmoil in view of the extreme information asymmetry. Some defining features of the global economy which could have a direct bearing on the current crises are: the “Great Moderation” – i.e., the sustained decline in inflation/inflation volatility and consequently, a secular lowering of nominal and real interest rates across the world which could have enhanced the appetite for risk; significant monetary accommodation by the major economies – the US, Euro area and BIS Review 145/2007 15 
Japan – since 2000 reflected in abundant liquidity in financial markets, macro imbalances between the US and Asia, sizeable currency misalignments and carry trades, compression of risk spreads, mispricing of widely diffused risks and even real sector implications for several emerging economies; and the strong macroeconomic performance of Asia which has contributed to the relentless search for yields and the increasing appetite for risk (Mohan, 2007e).  The combination of sustained low inflation accompanied by accommodative monetary policy worldwide could have generated excessive confidence in the ability of central banks and monetary policy to keep inflation rates and interest rates low indefinitely, leading to under pricing of risk and hence excessive risk taking. This result is analogous to the excessive foreign borrowing undertaken by private sector borrowers and banks in East Asian countries in the 1990s when exchange rates were seen as relatively fixed, and hence their risk perceptions were low, and hence risk was under priced. It may be ironic that the perceived success of central banks and increased credibility of monetary policy, giving rise to enhanced expectations with regard to stability in both inflation and interest rates, could have led to the mispricing of risk and hence enhanced risk taking. Yet another view is that more than success or failure of central banks, the repeated assurances of stability and guidance to markets about the future path of interest rates, coupled with the availability of ample liquidity were an invitation to markets to underprice risks. This view, consequently, puts the blame on those central banks that failed to give space to markets to assess risks by eschewing surprise elements in policy. It is possible that with increased globalisation resulting in the containment of prices of tradable goods during this period and hence of measured inflation, the excess liquidity has shown up in elevated asset prices worldwide, along with increased cross border capital flows in search of yields.  As some withdrawal of monetary accommodation commenced in response to perceived or visible inflationary pressures, the sub-prime crisis revealed these vulnerabilities starkly as confidence plunged, markets froze and triggered off panic among investors and lenders regarding their inability to value complex risky assets and structured derivative products. According to some estimates, total losses related to sub-prime could exceed US $ 200 billion (The Economist, 2007), over a fifth of India’s GDP measured at market exchange rates. According to the OECD estimates, losses could amount to US $ 300 billion. With the deterioration in credit confidence, banks have been forced to advance loans to their off-balance sheet “special investment vehicles (SIVs)” which used up their capital thereby rendering other borrowers credit constrained. Thus, it can be argued that the sub-prime is a symptom rather than a cause. Arguably, the outcome could have been quite different if, for instance, interest rates declined on the back of ebbing inflation but there was no accommodation in monetary policy and therefore no excess liquidity. There is also a persuasive opposite view, as best articulated by Alan Greenspan, that the great moderation in inflation could be attributed to real economy phenomena: the long run of productivity growth in the US; and the impact of new workers in China and India in dampening wage growth worldwide and hence inflation.  It is widely understood that the credit market is characterized by information asymmetry. First, the availability of information technology has reduced the cost of information collection and maintenance considerably. Thus, a widespread belief has arisen that information on credit quality of small borrowers who may be widely dispersed across jurisdictions can be made impersonal, packaged, processed, and sold. Second, with the availability of such technology, and the belief that such information was available on a structured basis, a great deal of financial innovation could take place which essentially enabled the investor or risk taker to become progressively remote from the ultimate borrowers where the actual risks lay. A whole host of intermediaries in the form of mortgage brokers, mortgage companies, societies and the like were then able to package their mortgage assets including non conforming loans and sell down to different categories of investors, including Special Investment Vehicles (SIVs), hedge funds and the like, most of whom were not regulated. The 16 BIS Review 145/2007 
guiding principle behind this activity was that it is feasible for credit rating agencies to have enough information on a continuous basis to rate the instruments that had been packaged. It can certainly be argued that this is not a new development since mortgage backed securities (MBS) and asset backed securities (ABS) have been with us for some time and have been successful in providing liquidity to credit markets on a continuous basis without any accidents. The difference perhaps is that MBS packaged by the government sponsored entities (GSEs) were subject to certain relatively well enforced norms that presumably reduced the potential risk embedded in these instruments. These considerations lead to the third set of issues that relate to the role of effective financial regulation and supervision. Has the recent crisis underscored the need for strengthening of oversight of financial markets in advanced countries? Traditionally, financial surveillance has placed relatively more emphasis on banking regulation. Banks are leveraged financial entities who are also effective trustees of public money by virtue of holding deposits. Hence, they have to be effectively regulated and supervised in order to maintain public confidence in the banking system and depositors have to be protected from excessive risk-taking by banks. On the other hand, investors in hedge funds are high net worth individuals who do not need such protection. They are informed investors who are able to exploit the information efficiency of markets and, therefore, should be able to understand the risks implied by information asymmetry. The current crisis was, however, triggered by the difficulties encountered by these investors who had taken large exposures to sub-prime mortgage investments without having accounted for the potential risks embedded in these instruments.  What has been our approach to these issues? Although there is a current move in some jurisdictions, particularly in the U.K., to move towards “principles-based” regulation, from the traditional “rules-based” regulation, we are continuing with the traditional rules-based regulatory approach for now. While progressively providing greater flexibility to banks in their portfolio decisions, relative to the situation before the reforms, we have kept a close eye on the risk exposure of regulated financial institutions. We have therefore been cautious about derivatives and are introducing them gradually, based on our perception of the risk management capabilities of the various regulated institutions. Admittedly, this does cause impatience in those institutions that believe their risk management capacities to be of a high order. However, the issue that we have to consider is the reality of the large variance between different institutions in such capabilities. It is true that financial markets cannot be held hostage to the most laggard institutions. So, we have adopted a measured approach to the introduction of modern financial innovations.  Second, we do monitor the exposures of banks to risky sectors and seek to limit their exposure to such sectors through prudential regulations. Banks exposure to capital markets in all forms (both fund based and non-fund based) cannot exceed 40 per cent of their net worth. Similarly, as we observed very high credit growth in certain segments such as real estate, housing, non banking finance companies (NBFCs) and other retail credit, risk weights were increased, along with provisioning norms for standard assets. Third, in terms of the evolving global prudential framework, the emphasis has generally been more on capital, as a means of reducing vulnerability to risks, than on prudential requirements for liquidity risk. Aspects relating to liquidity have been largely left to each regulator to assess and prescribe a suitable framework under Pillar II of Basel II. In the Indian context, while banks have flexibility in devising their own risk management strategies as per Board approved policy, the Reserve Bank has taken steps to mitigate liquidity risks at the very short-end, risks at the systemic level and at the institution level as well (Reddy, 2007c). Some of the important measures in this regard are: • Overnight unsecured market for funds is restricted only to banks and primary dealers (PD). Repo markets – both bilateral repos and collateralized borrowing and lending obligations (a form of tripartite repos) were developed. As a result, volumes have shifted from the overnight unsecured market to the collateralized market.  BIS Review 145/2007 17 
• As greater inter-linkages and excessive reliance on call money borrowings by banks could cause systemic problems, prudential measures have been introduced to address the extent to which banks can borrow and lend in the call money market. On a fortnightly average basis, call market borrowings outstanding should not exceed 100 per cent of capital funds (i.e., sum of Tier I and Tier II capital) of latest audited balance sheet. However, banks are allowed to borrow a maximum of 125 per cent of their capital funds on any day, during a fortnight. Similarly, on a fortnightly average basis, lending in the call market should not exceed 25 per cent of their capital funds; however, banks are allowed to lend a maximum of 50 per cent of their capital funds on any day, during a fortnight.  • Purchased inter-bank liabilities’ (IBL) of a bank should not exceed 200 per cent of its net worth (300 per cent for banks with CRAR more than 11.25 per cent).  • Like other supervisors, RBI has issued asset liability management guidelines for dealing with overall asset-liability mismatches taking into account both on and off balance sheet items.  • The RBI, in its supervisory oversight of banks’ activities, also monitors the incremental credit deposit ratio of banks. Although banks may implement sophisticated risk management strategies, this single ratio with a minimum lag indicates the extent to which banks are funding credit with borrowings from wholesale markets or what is now known as purchased funds.  • The RBI guidelines on securitization of standard assets have laid down detailed policy on provision of liquidity support to Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs). The liquidity provision is subject to conditions to ensure that the liquidity support is only temporary and invoked to meet cash flow mismatches. Any commitment to provide such liquidity facility is to be treated as an off-balance sheet item and attracts 100 per cent credit conversion factor as well as 100 per cent risk weight.  Fourth, since the Reserve Bank also has regulatory responsibility for NBFCs, we have also acted to introduce various prudential norms in their activities where we believe there could be systemic effects. The regulatory interventions are graded: higher in deposit taking institutions and lower in non-deposit taking institutions. The recent crises in developed financial markets have also illustrated how thin these lines of separation are: difficulties experienced by non-deposit intermediaries such as the SIVs are eventually falling on the deposit taking regulated institution such as banks. Thus, we do feel that judicious prudential regulation and supervision and heightened market surveillance and anticipation are necessary for the healthy governance of financial markets. We have, of course, to be careful to not stifle entrepreneurship and financial innovation. But we do need to constantly ask the question: “Financial innovation towards what objective?” As long as financial innovation is seen to promote price discovery, greater intermediation efficiency, and hence, overall efficiency and growth, it must be encouraged, but with appropriate safeguards to maintain financial stability. The lessons from the current financial market crisis go both ways. On the one hand, market innovation has indeed helped in bringing financial markets closer to those who need credit and did not have access to it earlier. Despite all the problems associated with sub-prime borrowers, it must be recognized that almost 10 million borrowers benefited from this market and were enabled access to housing finance, which had not been deemed possible earlier. With about 20 per cent of these borrowers reported to be delinquent, and in difficulty, it still means that about 8 million people clearly benefited from this market. On the other hand, the difficulties encountered draw attention to the kind of issues that can arise when the speed of innovation and incentive structures are flawed such that malpractices occur, and intrinsic difficulties arise in capturing and commoditizing information that is perhaps not yet susceptible to such commoditization.  18 BIS Review 145/2007 
A key question that has emerged from the current developments in financial markets relates to the role of monetary authorities in the context of such a crisis. This issue is of concern to all of us in central banking. Over the last decade or two, it would appear that the focus of central banks has been narrowing, relative to the more complex responsibilities that they have traditionally shouldered. A great deal has been written on this issue, a great deal has changed in terms of practices and, in some countries, the regulatory structure itself has been altered to move central banks to being relatively pure monetary authorities. According to this view, central banks should focus largely on keeping inflation low and stable, and in doing this also contribute to financial stability. To quote Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff: "Indeed many economists believe that central bankers could perfectly well be replaced with a computer programmed to implement a simple rule that adjusts interest rates in response to output and inflation. But while [this] view is theoretically rigorous, reality is not" (Businessworld, September 17, 2007). Although some central banks, such as the US Federal Reserve, have an explicit mandate to also promote growth, a good deal of thinking in recent times tends to argue that inflation control by itself would promote growth and that central banks would be better off to concentrate on this objective alone.  It is instructive to examine what central banks have done in the current context. The responses of the central banks to the recent events in financial markets have shown that concerns for financial stability can assume overriding importance, irrespective of the legislative mandate handed down to central banks as part of ongoing reforms. This is evident in the fact that central banks initially reacted through the injection of liquidity, including through special facilities and the expansion of list of eligible collateral. Discussions involving central bankers in various fora indicate their willingness to consider other courses of action in favour of protecting growth. As we all know, the US Federal Reserve has gone further in cutting interest rates to promote both growth and in the interest of financial stability; the U.K. authorities have had to provide liquidity to a specific institution, while giving a blanket guarantee to depositors on the safety of their deposits. Accordingly, it is becoming evident that central banks do have a role beyond inflation targeting. Evidently, both growth and financial stability matter for central banks.  When it comes to the crunch, in their roles as lenders of last resort (LOLR), and in discharging their responsibilities as the guardians of financial stability, central banks do need to perform functions that are more complex. Should central banks be lenders of last resort to the system as a whole by injecting systemic liquidity through open market operations only, or should they also provide liquidity to individual financial institutions that are judged to be solvent but illiquid? How do they arrive at such judgments if they do not have adequate information on individual institutions? Can they have such detailed information without ongoing responsibilities for regulation and supervision? This issue is not dissimilar, in terms of the existence of asymmetric information, to that of the problem of adequate transparency of information related to the value of collateral underlying asset backed securities.  Banks and financial institutions are typically leveraged institutions: thus judgements related to their solvency depend on the valuation of their assets at the time when difficulties arise. In the current case, banks have invested through a chain of vehicles in securities whose values are in doubt. Banks also have commitments to vehicles whose liquidity and/or viability are in doubt. When providing LOLR liquidity support, how is the central bank to make a judgement on the solvency of institutions to whom it is providing liquidity? As a greater recognition and appreciation of the appropriate role of central banks gains ground, it is possible that this will result in further rethinking on the functioning of central banks. A case in point is the separation of financial regulation and supervision from monetary policy which could have contributed to ineffective and inadequate surveillance in the context of the current crisis. There is a view that problems of information asymmetry might have got further aggravated with banks reporting both to the monetary authority and the regulatory body in charge of banking supervision.  BIS Review 145/2007 19 
Since the Reserve Bank of India is also the banking regulator and supervisor, we receive continuing information on the banking activities; moreover, in times such as the current turmoil, we can also obtain information quickly from leading systematically important institutions on exposures of relevance. Thus, there is a high scope for prompt corrective action.  V.  Challenges for the future Let me conclude by turning to the emerging challenges facing the financial sector in India that could shape the path of the next generation of reforms. The sustained acceleration in growth, supported by a range of anecdotal indications, is resulting in the movement of large numbers of households into higher income and consumption categories, with enhanced demand for financial services. Alongside, industrial production and export growth have remained buoyant and the rising prominence of services in the economy is generating a surge in demand for financial intermediation. A lead indicator is the sizeable expansion already underway in domestic bank lending to households and small and medium industrial and service enterprises which are poised to emerge as the new growth drives of financial sector activity. For the Indian financial system, the biggest challenge is how to extend itself and innovate to meet these new demands for financial inclusion and respond adequately to new opportunities and risks. Innovative channels for credit delivery for serving the new credit needs have to be developed, perhaps with greater use of information technology and intensified skills development in human capital. Acceleration in growth over the past few years has brightened medium-term prospects for growth of the Indian economy. As in the past, domestic savings are expected to finance the bulk of the investment requirements. In this context, the banking system will continue to be an important source of financing and there could be strong demand for bank credit. Although bank credit has witnessed sharp growth since 2003-04 onwards, it needs to be recognised that the credit-GDP ratio still remains relatively low. Moreover, a significant segment of the population remains excluded from banking services. As the growth process strengthens and becomes more inclusive, it is expected that demand for financial products could continue to witness high growth in the coming years. Thus, it is likely that growth in bank credit and monetary aggregates could be higher than what might be expected from historical relationships and elasticities in view of ongoing structural changes. This, however, raises critical issues for the central bank such as the appropriate order of monetary/credit expansion. In the absence of a yardstick, excessive growth in money supply could potentially show up in inflationary pressures over course of time, given the monetary lags. Indeed, recent inflationary pressures across the globe are attributable, in part, to global liquidity glut. In the absence of inflationary pressures as conventionally measured, excessive money and credit growth could also lead to asset price bubbles, with adverse implications for banking sector stability and lagged conventional inflation. Thus, the Reserve Bank will have to face ongoing challenges to provide appropriate liquidity to the system so as to ensure growth in non-inflationary environment.  Demand for housing finance has emerged as a key driver of bank credit in the past few years. As incomes grow further and the pace of urbanisation picks up, and, in view of the substantial backlog, demand for housing and housing finance can be expected to record continuous high growth over the next few years. In view of the expected high demand, pressure on real estate prices may continue. Moreover, real estate markets are characterised by opacity and other imperfections in developing countries, and certainly in India. Such developments can easily generate bubbles in the real estate market, because of problems in the elasticity of supply, and information asymmetries. Strong demand for housing and buoyancy in real estate prices in an environment of non-transparency, thus, could potentially pose risks to the banking system. In conjunction with interest rate cycles, the banking system as well as the regulator would need to be vigilant to future NPAs and the US-like sub-prime woes.  20 BIS Review 145/2007 
Higher investment needs of the growing economy will depend heavily upon the ability of the financial markets to raise resources from savers and allocate them efficiently for the most productive purposes. In view of the acceleration in growth as well as the focus on inclusive growth, financial markets will have to play a greater role in efficient allocation of resources. Further development of financial markets will also be needed in view of the growing openness and the envisaged move towards fuller capital account convertibility. The Reserve Bank will therefore continue to take measures to further deepen, widen and integrate the financial markets. While permitting a wider range of instruments and players in the financial markets, it will need to be ensured that development takes place in an orderly manner so as to avoid sub-prime like accidents and ensure stability. There is a premium on ensuring stability in low-income countries like India, with a significant share of population not in a position to withstand large changes in interest rates and exchange rates. Prudential exposure norms on exposures of banks and NBFCs will need to be fine-tuned so as to protect the balance sheets of banks and interests of depositors. The formation of credit information bureaus is expected to provide credit histories of borrowers and this could allow greater flow of bank credit to the relatively neglected sectors, while also imparting stability to the financial sector. So far, financial sector reforms have been calibrated with a progressive integration into the world economy. A key consideration in the choice of pace and sequencing has been the management of volatility in financial markets and implications for the conduct of monetary operations. Fuller capital account openness will inevitably lead up to the challenge of managing the impossible trinity of independent monetary policy, open capital account, and managed exchange rate. In the context of the ongoing financial sector reforms, it needs to be recognised that the impact of financial fluctuations on the real sector in developing economies is significantly different from mature economies which specialise in technology intensive products in which the degree of exchange rate pass through is low, enabling exporters and importers to ignore temporary shocks and set stable product prices to maintain monopolistic positions, despite large currency fluctuations. Mature and well developed financial markets in these countries absorb the risks associated with exchange rate fluctuations with negligible spillover on real activity. On the other hand, for the majority of developing countries which specialise in labour-intensive and low and intermediate technology products vulnerable to pricing power by large retail chains, exchange rate and financial price volatility has significant employment, output and distributional consequences which in turn, have implications for financial sector stability and soundness.  A further challenge for policy in the context of fuller capital account openness will be to preserve the financial stability of different markets as greater deregulation of capital outflows and debt inflows occurs. The vulnerability of financial intermediaries can perhaps be addressed through prudential regulations and their supervision; risk management of non-financial entities will have to be through further developments in both the corporate debt market and the forex market, which enable them to manage their risks through the use of newer market instruments. This will require market development, enhancement of regulatory capacity in these areas, as well as human resource development in both financial intermediaries and non-financial entities. Given the volatility of capital flows, it remains to be seen whether financial market development in a country like India can be such that this volatility does not result in unacceptable disruption in exchange rate determination with inevitable real sector consequences, and in domestic monetary conditions. Going forward, there will be a continuous need to adapt the strategy of liquidity management as well as exchange rate management for effective monetary management and short-term interest rate smoothening. The key questions we continue to face with are what should be the instruments and modes of management of liquidity in the interest of growth and financial stability and how much should capital flows affect exchange rate. These issues become even more relevant under a freer regime of capital flows. Global developments are expected to have an increasing role in determining the conduct of monetary and exchange rate policies in BIS Review 145/2007 21 
our country. In an environment of global convergence, retaining independence of monetary policy may become increasingly difficult, calling for hard choices in terms of goals and instruments.  In India, we have not favoured the adoption of inflation targeting, while keeping the attainment of low inflation as a central objective of monetary policy, along with that of high and sustained growth that is so important for a developing economy. Apart from the legitimate concern regarding growth as a key objective, there are other factors that suggest that inflation targeting may not be appropriate for India. First, unlike many other developing countries we have had a record of moderate inflation, with double digit inflation being the exception, and which is largely socially unacceptable. Second, adoption of inflation targeting requires the existence of an efficient monetary transmission mechanism through the operation of efficient financial markets and absence of interest rate distortions. Third, inflationary pressures still often emanate from significant supply shocks related to the effect of the monsoon on agriculture, where monetary policy action may have little role. Finally, in an economy as large as that of India, with various regional differences, and continued existence of market imperfections in factor and product markets between regions, the choice of a universally acceptable measure of inflation is also difficult.  As regards banking regulation and supervision, there is no unique theoretical model or just one practical approach to the regulation and supervision of a financial system. India has traditionally followed an institution-based system of regulation. In India, the current model of regulation with the Reserve Bank exchanging relevant information with other regulators in a synchronised manner is functioning effectively. The supervisory activities of the Reserve Bank have benefited from its price stability objective, and it is recognised that safety and soundness of banks must be evaluated jointly with its responsibility to ensuring stability and growth in the economy. In this regard, the Reserve Bank with joint responsibilities for monetary policy and supervision has both the insight and the authority to use techniques that are less blunt and more precisely calibrated to the problem at hand. Such tools improve its ability to manage crises and, more importantly, to avoid them. In this backdrop, the recommendations of separating banking sector regulation from the conduct of monetary policy by some observers appear to be independent of the history, legacy and efficiency of the current regulatory system in India. Such recommendations are essentially based on the UK experience – which itself has now been subject to severe criticism in the episode involving the Northern Rock – and completely ignore the huge diversity of the regulatory system in other countries including those prevailing in successful international financial centres such as the US.  As noted in several policy statements in the Indian context, the principal challenge for public policy is to ensure a smooth transition to higher growth path, accompanied by low and stable inflation and well anchored inflation expectations. From a central banking perspective, the new challenges facing us are many. First, if the Indian banking system is to attain international excellence, it will require action on several fronts like introduction of greater competition; convergence of activities and supervision of financial conglomerates; induction of new technology; improvement in credit risk appraisal; encouragement of financial innovations; improvement in internal controls; and establishment of an appropriate legal framework. The role of the Reserve Bank in this context amounts to promoting safety and soundness while allowing the banking system to compete and innovate. Second, as a central bank, the Reserve Bank would further need to develop the financial markets, especially the money, government securities and foreign exchange markets to enhance the efficiency of the transmission mechanism, along with the corporate debt market. Third, price stability and financial stability would continue to be of concern with expected increase in credit expansion and global integration. Thank you. 22 BIS Review 145/2007
